"Sep 9, 2020",3:59 P.M. EDT,"President Donald Trump: (00:01)
Apart from matters of war and peace, the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice is the most important decision an American President can make. For this reason candidates for President owe the American people a specific list of individuals they consider for the United States Supreme Court. Four years ago, I announced my first list of highly qualified candidates and promise to fill Justice Scalia’s vacant seat from them from among those names. And just days after my inauguration, I kept that promise when I nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch. And as you know, he has been very spectacular. A year later, I nominated and the Senate confirmed another outstanding justice, Brett Kavanaugh. By the end of my first term, we will have confirmed a record number of federal judges, over 300, all of whom will faithfully uphold our Constitution as written. What has always made America exceptional is our reverence for the impartial rule of law.
President Donald Trump: (01:16)
People have come from all over the world to pursue the American dream based on this sacred principle. Equality under the law is the bedrock of our society. It is the principle that inspired American heroes to abolish slavery and end segregation, secure civil rights and build the most free and just nation in history. Unfortunately, there is a growing radical left movement that rejects thl speech, and require taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. They will give unelected bureaucrats the power to destroy millions of American jobs. They will remove the words “Under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance, they will unilaterally declare the death penalty unconstitutional, even for the most depraved mass murderers. They will erase national borders, cripple police departments, and grant new protections to anarchists, rioters, violent criminals, and terrorists.
President Donald Trump: (02:39)
In the recent past, many of our most treasured freedoms, including religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms have been saved by a single vote on the United States Supreme Court. Our cherished rights are at risk, including the right to life and our great Second Amendment. Over the next four years, America’s President will choose hundreds of federal judges and in all likelihood, one, two, three, and even four Supreme Court Justices. The outcome of these decisions will determine whether we hold fast to our nation’s founding principles or whether they are lost forever. That is why today I am announcing 20 additions to my original list of candidates for the United States Supreme Court. Should there be another vacancy on the Supreme Court during my presidency, my nominee will come from the names I have shared with the American public, including the original list and these 20 additions.
President Donald Trump: (03:44)
Joe Biden has refused to release his list, perhaps because he knows the names are so extremely far left that they could never withstand public scrutiny or receive acceptance. He must release a list of justices for people to properly make a decision as to how they will vote. It is very important that he do so. My original list of potential justices include many of our nation’s brightest legal minds, such as Bill Pryor, Amy Coney Barrett, and Thomas Hardiman, outstanding people. Like those distinguished individuals, the 20 additions I am announcing today would be jurors in the mold of Justice Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Aledo.
President Donald Trump: (04:36)
Their names are as follows: Bridget Bady of Arizona, Judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Daniel Cameron of Kentucky, Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Paul Clement of Virginia, Former Solicitor General of the United States. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Stewart Kyle Duncan of Louisiana, Judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Steven Engel of the District of Columbia, Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice. Noel Francesco, former Solicitor General of the United States. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. James Hoe of Texas, Judge on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. Gregory Kattsis of Virginia, Judge on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. Barbara Lagoa of Florida, Judge on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Christopher Landau of Maryland, United States ambassador to Mexico. Carlos Muniz of Florida, Justice on the Supreme Court of Florida. Martha Packold of Illinois, Judge on the district court for the Northern District of Illinois.
President Donald Trump: (06:18)
Peter Phipps of Pennsylvania, Judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Sarah Pittlick of Missouri, Judge on the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Alison Jones-Rushing of North Carolina, Judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Kate Todd of Virginia, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Counsel to the President. Lawrence van Dyke of Nevada, Judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
President Donald Trump: (06:54)
Every one of these individuals will ensure equal justice, equal treatment and equal rights for citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. Together we will defend our righteous heritage and preserve our magnificent American way of life. Thank you, God bless America. Thank you very much. Does anybody have any questions on the judges, please? Anybody? On the judges, excuse me. Any questions? They’re outstanding people. Very important decision, very important that Joe Biden put up potential nominees. I think it’s a very important thing for our country that he do that. Okay, please go ahead. Do you have a question?
Speaker 2: (07:39)
Can you address the concerns from the Woodward book in regards to whether did you mislead the public by saying how you downplayed the Coronavirus and that you repeatedly did that in order to reduce panic? Did you mislead the public?
President Donald Trump: (07:57)
Well, I think if you said in order to reduce panic, perhaps that’s so. The fact is I’m a cheerleader for this country. I love our country and I don’t want people to be frightened. I don’t want to create panic, as you say, and certainly I’m not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. We want to show confidence. We want to show strength. We want to show strength as a nation and that’s what I’ve done. And we’ve done very well. We’ve done well from any standard. You look at our numbers compared to other countries, other parts of the world, it’s been an amazing job that we’ve done. I think it’s very sad in many respects because the incredible individuals working so hard on it, including our Vice President, they’ve done this great job. They haven’t been acknowledged by the news media and they should for the job we’ve done, whether it’s ventilators.
President Donald Trump: (08:48)
And now you’ll see very soon with vaccines and with therapeutics, the job we’ve done has been incredible, but we don’t want to instill panic. We don’t want to jump up and down and start shouting that we have a problem that is a tremendous problem, scare everybody. And I’ll tell you the other thing, we immediately started buying all over the world. We started buying masks and gowns and everything else, and we don’t want to cause pricing to go up to a level that becomes almost unaffordable. So yeah. And so in that sense, I agree with it. Yeah. Please
Speaker 3: (09:25)
How do you reassure the American public going forward that they can trust what you’re saying?
President Donald Trump: (09:29)
Well, I think that’s a really a big part of trust. We have to have leadership. We have to show leadership. And the last thing you want to do is create a panic in the country. This was a horrible thing. It was sent to us by China. Should not have happened, should never have happened. This is a disgusting, terrible situation that was foisted upon us. And we have to show, we just don’t want to use, the best word is panic. We don’t want to have to show panic. We’re not going to show panic. And that’s exactly what I did. And I was very open, whether it’s to Woodward or anybody else, it’s just another political hit job. But whether it was Woodward or anybody else, you cannot show a sense of panic or you’re going to have bigger problems than you ever had before. Please.
Speaker 4: (10:14)
[crosstalk 00:10:14] than trying to reduce the panics that were in February 17th. It’s more deadly than you’re stressing this flu.
President Donald Trump: (10:22)
Go ahead please.
Speaker 5: (10:23)
Mr. President, don’t you think if you were more forthright with the American people, more lives could have been saved? Do you take responsibility at all for some of the 200,000 deaths that we’ve had?
President Donald Trump: (10:33)
So I think if we didn’t do what we did, we would have had millions of people die. We closed up our country. We close it up very, very quickly, very effectively. We did a job. We learned about this horrible disease along with the rest of the world, which had to learn about it. And then we opened it up and now we know the vulnerable, we know who it attacks, who it’s so vicious against. And I think we’ve done from every standpoint a incredible job. We shouldn’t have lost anybody. Nobody should have lost. China released something that they shouldn’t have been allowed to, they should not have released. It came out of China, it went to Europe, it went all over the world should have never happened. They could’ve stopped it. They stopped it from going into the remainder of China. It started in Wuhan and they stopped it, but they didn’t stop it from coming to our country.
President Donald Trump: (11:22)
Now we had to show calm. We had to show, if it was up to you or whoever, I have no idea what he said in the book. And again, it’s a book that I gave him some quotes and frankly, we’ll see how the book turned out. I have no idea. You’re asking me questions for the first time. But again, the last thing we can show is panic or excitement or fear or anything else. We had to take care of the situation we were given. Long before anybody else wanted to do it, I closed our borders to a very heavily infected China. If I didn’t do that, we would have had hundreds of thousands more people die.
President Donald Trump: (12:07)
Dr. Fauci said it, many people said it. It was a great decision. It was a decision I made and I had to make, it was a decision that a lot of people thought I was wrong. Nancy Pelosi said I was wrong. Joe Biden said I was wrong. They all came back and they said it was the right decision. And I was way early. That was in January. The end of January I did that. So that was a very good thing we did. Otherwise we would have had hundreds of thousands more. But if we didn’t close the country, we would have been talking about millions of people instead of the numbers that we have right now.
Speaker 6: (12:42)
You mentioned that you were trying to avoid price gouging, but you mentioned to Bob Woodward that you recognize this virus spread through the year on February 7th, you didn’t begin Project Airbridge until March. You didn’t use the Fed Production Act until March. You didn’t start ramping up ventilator production until March.
President Donald Trump: (12:58)
You didn’t really think it was going to be to the point where it was. All of a sudden the world was infected. The entire world was infected. Everyone was scrambling around looking where to buy face masks and all of the other things. We’ve opened up factories. We’ve had tremendous success with face masks and with shields and with the ventilators, we’re now supplying the rest of the world. We have all the ventilators we can use. And remember this, the ventilators were very important, not one person that needed a ventilator didn’t get it. And these are very complex, expensive machines to make.
President Donald Trump: (13:30)
We opened up something like hadn’t been done since the second World War. Honestly, we’ve done an incredible job, but we don’t want to run around screaming, shouting, “Oh, look at this. Look at this.” We have to show leadership. And leadership is all about confidence and confidence is confidence in our country and our people have been great, we’ve been put through a lot by China by releasing this, by having this come here, we will put through a lot. They could have done something about it and they chose not to. I am very honored to have presented to you today a list of 20 incredible people. And we will talk later. I’m sure we’ll be meeting later in the day. Thank you very much.
Speaker 7: (14:10)
Mr. President, we knew about Coronavirus in January, late January [crosstalk 00:14:14]"
"Sep 8, 2020",1:26 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Well, thank you very much. Thank you.
Crowd: (00:00)
Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.
Donald Trump: (01:28)
Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to be in North Carolina. We had great, great luck and great people backing us in North Carolina. And I’m thrilled to be in Winston Salem with thousands of loyal, hard working American Patriots. You are great people. Great people. I don’t know how many people here, but there’s a lot. We said let’s keep it down. They didn’t do too good a job, but that’s good. That’s good. Now these crowds, I tell you it’s beyond what we had in terms of enthusiasm, beyond what we had four years ago in 2016, and that was a record enthusiasm and we are breaking that record by a lot.
Donald Trump: (02:11)
This is the most important election we’ve ever had. 56 days from now, we’re going to win North Carolina. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. This is a choice. And I must say, this is a choice for many, many decades. I don’t think you has a bigger difference and maybe you’ve never had a bigger difference. This is the American dream and the other, I don’t want to say it because I’ll get myself in trouble with the fake news back there. But the other is a basic disaster for our country. Joe Biden devoted his career to offshoring your jobs, throwing open your borders, dragging us into endless foreign wars, along with some of his other friends and surrendering our children’s future to countries like China.
Donald Trump: (03:08)
Remember this, very simple to remember. If Biden wins, China wins. It’s as simple as that. So you have a situation where we built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We were forced to close it because of the China plague that came in and now we’ve opened it. And by the way, your state should be open. Your state should be open. Any governor that does that. And even if you look statistically, it’s you it’s Michigan, it’s a couple of others. They’re closed. New York. Look what they’re doing in New York, what they’re doing to our beautiful New York.
Donald Trump: (04:02)
It’s so sad. But you just take a look at what’s going on in North Carolina. They want to open. They want to open. They want to open in Michigan so badly. They want to open. They want to have football. They want to have their schools open. And it’s a shame what’s going on. And I’ll tell you what, on November 4th, every one of those states will be open. They’re doing it for political reasons. They’re doing it for political reasons. They think by hurting the economy, by keeping all these store owners and all these people that work in shops and stores and buildings, offices, they think by keeping them and hurting them, you’re hurting the economy.
Donald Trump: (04:44)
Our economy is doing phenomenally well. And it’s not only is it a V, it’s a super V. You see what’s happened. We just had a jobs number come out, 1.4 million. It’s down to 8.4%. Nobody thought that, 8.4. So we had the greatest economy, we closed it up and now we’re opening it up and your state should go with it. We’re opening it up. And we will have a great third quarter. It’s going to be announced, by the way, just before the election, but we’re going to have a great third quarter. We have unbelievable retail numbers, unbelievable numbers all over.
Donald Trump: (05:22)
And this is that super V. But next year is going to be one of the greatest years in the history of a country economically, unless the wrong person gets in and quadruples everybody’s taxes in which case you will see a depression the likes of which you haven’t seen. And remember this, if Biden wins the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place. They’re Biden people. They’re Biden states and cities. They’re Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, yeah, I want your meal. Give me that food. Give me that.
Donald Trump: (06:01)
A woman sitting there, she wants to eat. And they come and they grab her food. They grab her drink. Nobody’s ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let it happen. And in Portland, you see what happened last night, they arrested over 50 people the first time. We said, either do it or what going in. We’re going to have to go in, do it. Let us go in. We’re saying I spoke to the governor of Oregon the other day. Let us go in. I said, let us go in. We’ll straighten it out in less than a half an hour.
Donald Trump: (06:39)
Now the US Marshals did go in to take care of that one guy who killed somebody. You saw that. He killed a young man in the middle of the street violently. He had other charges against him. And I put out, when is he going to be arrested? And they went in about 15 minutes later. And I’ll tell you what our federal government is so ready to go. All they have to do is call us. It’ll all be solved very quickly. They have to call them. But all of these places are Democrat run places, radical left run places. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing.
Donald Trump: (07:16)
If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win. He said the other day, well, if I win, that doesn’t mean that’s going to stop. He doesn’t, he will never stop. If they win, it’s not going to happen, hopefully. Because this is not like a second place crowd. Let’s face it. Are you seeing? Are you seeing all the polls numbers are coming out? That’s why he left. Finally, he left his basement. He said we got problems. I don’t think he knows that, but the people that manage him know it. They understand it. He doesn’t. So I’m running for reelection to keep jobs at home, to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to America, not to China and other countries. Because if we win, America wins. You know that. You’ve seen that. Over the last three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders, fixed our broken trade deals, and they were broken like you’ve never seen. They weren’t even broken. They were bad. They were bad from day one. Rebuilt the awesome power of the United States military, obliterated the ISIS caliphate 100%. In fact, I got it down to 98%. Remember a year and a half ago, I got it down to 98. And they all said, no, no, it’s got to be a 100. I said, somebody else could finish. We want to get home.
Donald Trump: (08:41)
They said, no, you’ve got to finish it, so we took another two months, we finished it and we’re bringing them home. We’re bringing them home. These great, great warriors. People don’t like it when I say that. Secured American energy independence and built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And now we are very simply, we’re doing it again and we’re on track to have, as I said, the best year we’ve ever had next year. You just had the best year. You just had the best year of the history of your state last year. We’ve created a record breaking 10.6 million jobs in the last four months.
Donald Trump: (09:19)
Next year will be the single greatest economic year in the history of our country and probably in the history of your state, if your governor ever opens up. But hopefully you’re going to have Dan Forrest. You’re not going to have [inaudible 00:09:31]. But if sleepy Joe Biden takes power, the economy will collapse. He won’t even know the difference. How’s the economy? Not good, sir. We’re in a depression. We are? What’s that? Joe Biden, who spent 47 years shipping North Carolina jobs to China and other countries, you know that. And I’ve spent the last four years bringing jobs back to our country.
Donald Trump: (09:59)
We’ve never had so many jobs. We’re up to 160 million jobs. We were never anywhere close. We got up to 160 million and we were never anywhere close to that. Here in North Carolina, voting is already underway. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity or whether we allow the same left wing extremists that have no idea what they’re doing to burn down buildings or take control of government, set fire to a whole country. You know, when they started knocking down the monuments and statues a few months ago, I signed a very strong executive order.
Donald Trump: (10:41)
You want to knock them down? That’s fine. But you go to jail for 10 years. It was amazing. It was amazing how that stopped. And then they said, well, we’ll do it easily. We’ll do it through the process because they don’t want to spend 10 years. You know, they’d look at it. They’d say not worth it. 10 years is too much. But the DC committee, did you see about that? They want to change the name of the Washington Monument. They want to get rid of the Lincoln Monument, Jefferson Monument. Now, we’re talking the big stuff. They finally hit the big time, took them awhile to get there.
Donald Trump: (11:17)
But I said that was going to happen. Don’t worry about it. You don’t have a thing to worry about. If our foreign adversaries were devising a scheme to cripple America, they could hardly do better than the Biden, Kamala Harris, Kamala. Remember Kamala? She started at 15. She was supposed to win. Problem was she went from 15 to 14 to 12 to 10 to seven to four. It’s like a free fall. You know what, people don’t like her. Nobody likes her. She could never be the first woman president. She could never be. That would be an insult to our country.
Donald Trump: (11:59)
Biden wants to impose a $4 trillion tax hike, a ban on American energy, eliminate America’s borders, confiscate your guns. He wants to get rid of your second amendment. We’re going to be appointing very pro crime judges, but they want to destroy your suburbs. You know, the rule, the regulation that I just terminated. They want to build low income projects in the suburbs. They’ve been doing it. They’ve been destroying suburbs. We’re not doing it anymore. Somebody said suburban women, how’s Trump doing? But do you remember last time too? They said women don’t like Trump.
Donald Trump: (12:42)
I said, I think they do. I think they do. They said women don’t, and then we did great with women. And remember that great. Was that one of the greatest evenings ever? Four years ago. That was one of the greatest. But one of the things they did, first of all, we did much better. Now we’re doing really well. African American vote, much better Hispanic vote, much better. He did better with African Americans than we thought. He did better with Hispanic than we thought. He did better with Asians than we thought. He did really well with women. What’s this all about?
Donald Trump: (13:27)
Ladies and gentlemen. And they said, Donald Trump is projected the winner of 2016. You remember that evening? Was that the craziest? That was the craziest thing. And they thought, I think they didn’t think it, but I’ll tell you what anything we had then, we have much more now. They don’t understand. They do understand it. They do. Right? They understand it. Look at that beautiful dress. And she wears that dress right through the middle of Hollywood and everyone says, thank you very much. Beautiful. Like it. But they want to indoctrinate your children and implement a ruin or shutdown of the United States economy again.
Donald Trump: (14:15)
Biden said the other day, well, if the experts told me. We’re not shutting it down again. We don’t have to. We learned about the disease. We did the right thing. We saved millions of lives. People don’t realize we saved millions of lives and hundreds of thousands of lives by not letting China. We put a ban on China, heavily infected. And Biden was against it. Three months later, he said he did the right thing, I have to admit. It’s clear why both China and the flag burning rioters want Biden to win. They know his policies will be the downfall of America and they know my policies will lift America to new heights of national greatness like we’ve never seen before.
Donald Trump: (14:56)
That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s happening. And never forget, they’re coming after me because I’m fighting for you. There’s a lot of truth in that one. And they do come after me. They do come after me. They have more things to say about me. Every day, it’s something. They said, you see the plane where it is? Sir, would you like to take the car? I say, why? I’m saying what? Well, I heard you had a limp. I do? I don’t know about a limp. I don’t have a limp. Hey, someday, I’m going to have a limp. I’ll let you know when. You’ll see it. No, they make this stuff up.
Donald Trump: (15:33)
They make it up. They make stuff. It’s called disinformation. They give a phony deal out. They did it two days ago with the military. There’s nobody that loves the military more than me. I was very lucky though. I had 15 incredible American Patriots that came by and they said, he never said that. They were there. They were there. But they make up stories, horrible stories, many, many. Hey, look, look at last time, the fake dirty dossier. It was all made up. And frankly, if the shoe was on the other foot, if it was on the other foot, you’d have many people, 20, 25 people right now in jail for two years and they’d be there for 50 years because they got caught spying on our campaign and it’s treason or whatever else you want to call it.
Donald Trump: (16:27)
And it’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. It’s a disgrace that it’s taken this long. And let me just tell you a little secret. Obama got caught and so did sleepy Joe Biden. Remember Biden just sitting in the room saying, why don’t you use the Logan Act on General Flynn? Look at General Flynn, what he’s going through for years. If that were ever reversed, I’m telling you, you’d have many people in jail for many, many years and it would have started three years ago. It’s a disgrace, but let’s see what happens. Biden’s a globalist sellout who spent his career laying waste to American communities.
Donald Trump: (17:08)
And you know, he talks about like, well, he’s going to do this. He’s going to … He doesn’t have any idea. He has no clue. He’s going to do this. He’s been there for 47 years. And he just really left. He left three and a half, four years ago. So he just left, but he’s been there for 47 years. I’m going to do this. After 47 years, he’s had a change of heart. This is the craziest election. This is the craziest … Look, somebody said, what’s the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and slow Joe? So the difference is the following. She’s meaner, probably not as nice.
Donald Trump: (17:46)
I don’t know. You can’t get any worse than her, when you think. But the big difference is she’s smarter than he is. Okay. He’s a nicer person, but he’s not smart. He never was, not in prime time and certainly not now. The Washington vultures ripped apart our towns in exchange for his party’s nomination. Biden has now formed an unholy alliance with the most extreme and dangerous elements of the radical left, you know that, with crazy Bernie and everyone. And by the way, you know who’s further left than crazy Bernie? Kamala, Kamala, Kamala. You remember she left the race.
Donald Trump: (18:31)
Sort of interesting that they picked her because in theory, they should be able to win in California. I don’t know. Maybe we’ll make a play for that one too. But they picked somebody from California. I don’t quite get it, but you always pick somebody that’s hot. That’s going up in the polls, going up. Frankly, I’m not sure. I don’t think I’ve ever said this, but probably Hillary should have picked Bernie Sanders to be her running mate. Right? Because as crazy as it sounds, he was hot. He gave her a hell of a fight. A lot of people think he won and it got taken away.
Donald Trump: (19:06)
One thing about Bernie, he’s the greatest loser I’ve ever seen because look, any children here? No not too many, but they’ve heard it before. He got screwed four years ago and he got screwed again. Biden got the nomination. He got the nomination. But if Biden would have sat back and if Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas, you remember Pocahontas? She finally faded. She faded badly. But if she would have dropped out on Super Tuesday, prior to Super Tuesday, Bernie would have been the nominee. And I don’t know who I’d rather run against. One is super left.
Donald Trump: (19:45)
The other one’s had to become super left. One is competent. The other one is only half competent now and heading south. He’s half competent and heading south rapidly. But the globalists and the leftists make natural partners because they’re united by their contempt for the American middle class in the truest sense. That’s why powerful corporations and far left politicians have both sided with radical demonstrated over. If you look at that, it’s over the law abiding areas that we have. Republican cities and towns are doing great. We’re doing great.
Donald Trump: (20:21)
And we don’t have crime and we don’t have this violence. Chicago over the weekend, many people killed, many people shot, shot. They’re actually shot and killed. New York, the same thing. New York’s gone through the roof. They were up 300% in certain categories. And you say, what’s happening? And we want to send them in so badly. Joe Biden and his party spent the entire summer cheering on the rioters rampaging through a Democrat run cities falsely labeling them as peaceful protesters. And you know, we call you peaceful protesters, you know why?
Donald Trump: (20:55)
Because they have rules in these Democrat run states that if you’re campaigning, you can’t have more than five people. They-
Donald Trump: (21:03)
That if you’re campaigning you can’t have more than five people. They did that for me. If you are going to church you can’t go to church anymore. You can’t go to church. You can’t go to church, you can’t do anything. You have to stay in your house but if you’re willing to riot, running down Main Street, if you’re willing to riot and stand on top of each other’s face and do whatever the hell you want to do, you’re allowed to do that because you’re considered a peaceful protester so we decided to call all our rallies peaceful protests.
Donald Trump: (21:38)
Instead of standing up to the far left rioters, Biden condemns law enforcement and condemns America. Didn’t even mention the words that we love and respect, law and order. You know [inaudible 00:21:51] even my people, my very brilliant consultants who I don’t listen to too much, maybe I should. “Sir, please don’t say law and order. That’s too tough.” Now in the meantime you look at these streets, people crazy. They say, “Say law and order but with safety.” I said, “Look, people get it. It’s just law and order, is that okay?” We want law and order. They say, “Law and order and safety, sir. Could you add the word safety? Because it’s …” I said, “I don’t want to add.” It’s sort of obvious, right? We want law, we want order.
Donald Trump: (22:24)
Biden is fueling the violence with his relentless attacks on police and his constant slander that America is racist. By the way I’ve gotten the support of almost every police group in the country. Sheriffs in Florida, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina. All over the country, but did you notice he’s starting to talk a little bit tougher now, did you notice that? He sees what’s going on, his polls are dropping like a rock and he sees what’s going on. Now he’s starting to say, “No, we need law and order.” No he didn’t say that, did he? He’ll never get to say that, can’t say that because then it’d lose the whole left and let me tell you the left is running that party. You take a look at … You don’t want to be dealing with the left. These people are stone cold crazy, you don’t want to be dealing.
Donald Trump: (23:16)
Meanwhile Biden, he doesn’t say a word about the thousands of African-Americans who are murdered each year as a result of violent crime in Democrat-controlled cities. They’re murdered by the thousands and they never, ever mention it. My heart is with the hardworking patriots of all backgrounds who build up our communities, not the violent criminals and extremists and agitators and anarchists who burn them down. Next time you see video of screaming far left maniacs shouting wildly at peaceful Americans, remember this. These are Biden supporters, and if he wins, they will be in charge of your government as sure as you’re sitting there. You’ll be taking your monuments down. You’ll be taking your statues down. I’m not kidding, you’ll be taking them down. You have to look at the D.C. report, I’m just telling you, go get it, you wouldn’t even believe it. It’s too crazy to even talk about, but we’re never going to give them a chance to do it. We’re never giving them a chance. We’re going to win, we’re going to win big. This is a very important state, and by the way …
Donald Trump: (24:26)
By the way, when they send out their millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, when you get a ballot, say, “Well I wanted to go and vote, darling. I wanted to go and vote. Why are they sending me those ballots?” There’s something really … The only way we lose North Carolina and a couple of others like Nevada, we’re doing great there. Now the governor decides we’re doing so well that they’re going to send out unsolicited. You have solicited and unsolicited. They’re going to send out millions of ballots to you. People that never really thought in terms of it. Now sometimes you’ll ask for a ballot. That’s a solicited ballot. It’s okay, you have to go through a process, you have to sign the form, you get it. Sending out millions of unsolicited ballots. Make sure you send the ballot in and then go to your polling place and make sure it counts. Make sure it counts. Because the only way they can win is by doing very bad things. That’s the only way.
Donald Trump: (25:23)
Look at this. If Joe Biden came here and made a … This is not the most convenient place. It’s an airport. Hi fellas. They did a good job guiding the plane. They’re great. They’re great. No, really. This is an airport. Honestly, I really … If he had 200 people, I think it would be a lot. I really mean it. You ever see the gyms with the circles? That’s his crowd. If he had 200 people. I was told we have 15,000 people here tonight. [inaudible 00:25:57] as far as the eye can see, but they’ll correct it. They’ll say, “He’s wrong, it was 14,500, he’s misrepresenting. He’s misrepresenting.” Now I was told we have 15,000 and we’re in the middle of an airport someplace. It’s a wonderful thing. I actually think … I don’t know if you agree.
Donald Trump: (26:19)
So we go to the arenas but because of China, the arenas aren’t working out too well, right? You can’t really do that anymore for a while but we are rounding the turn, I will tell you, we’re rounding the turn on that but because of that … So we said where because we have the same crowds. I think we have bigger crowds potentially. We were in New Hampshire the other night, we had to turn away 8,000 people at an airport. We’re doing all mostly hangar things because we’re outside. Outside is very much different than being inside according to the great doctors, right? But they say it’s very much different.
Donald Trump: (26:50)
So we’re doing these and we’re doing the outdoors, we’re doing the hangars, but I really believe that these crowds are bigger than they were four years ago. It’s pretty amazing. It’s pretty amazing. We started off in New Hampshire, we said, “Look, let’s have 1,000 people,” and they had like five or six show up and they had thousands more. We’re trying to be nice but then eventually we landed … Two weeks ago, we landed in New Hampshire and the entire runaway was lit up with thousands and thousands of people as the plane was landing and I mean it’s really amazing what’s going on. All over the country, it’s amazing. It’s amazing. It’s a great thing.
Donald Trump: (27:32)
More support than we had four years ago because four years ago I said I was going to do this, I was going to cut your taxes, I was going to cut regulations, I was going to get right to try, I was going to take care of your vets, I was going to rebuild your military, I was going to do all these things and you said, “I don’t know. That’s a lot of …” You know what? I’ve actually done more than I promised. Build a wall, build a wall, true. I’ve done more. For instance you never heard me say, you never heard me say, a lot of you were at various rallies, you never heard me talking about space force. We built, think of it. A new branch of the United States military, the United States Armed Forces called Air Force. I never talked about that. That’s something we never talked about. I only figured that one out after I became president because I saw what Russia was doing and what China was doing. I said we have to do the same thing, and if you think that was easy, that was not easy. That was not easy, it was very hard.
Donald Trump: (28:36)
But what we’ve done … You know the wall now is past 300 miles. It’s exactly the wall that our great Border Patrol wanted. I was hoping a nice concrete plank for the builders in here, boom, boom, you put it. “Sir, we have to be able to see through.” I said, “All right, let’s go. Much more expensive.” I said, “Let’s go.” So we’re over 300 miles now and we will be finished with it very soon and we have among the safest borders that we’ve ever had by far and it’s a good time to have it too.
Donald Trump: (29:08)
You know Mexico is paying for the wall just so you understand. They don’t say that. They never say it, but we’re going to charge a small fee at the border, the toll booths. We have toll booths. It’s the biggest border in the world in terms of people going across and in terms of industry, believe it or not, the southern border. We’re putting a small toll on and maybe we’re going to do something with remittance. That’s when people come here, make money and they send it back, so we’ll do something and we’re going to get all the money that we spent on the wall will be coming back so … Remember I used to say who’s going to pay for it? They’d say Mexico [inaudible 00:29:47]? That’s right. Mexico is going to pay for it.
Donald Trump: (29:54)
What happens if they fight us? Remember that answer? It’s going to get 10 feet higher. Remember that. What happens if they fight us on the wall? The wall’s going to get 10 feet higher but now Mexico and I get along great. In fact they have 27,000 soldiers along our southern border protecting us from people coming to our country. Can you imagine that? 27,000, and I did that so that we don’t put tariffs on their products coming in, it was very simple. I said you got to do it and the president’s been great, he’s a friend of mine, he’s doing a very good job. Not easy, Mexico’s not easy, but he’s doing a very good job, but the wall is almost completed and it’s a tremendous wall. It’s everything that the Border Patrol wanted. I gave them everything. I said, “What else do you want?” It’s wired for every single thing you could have. Remember the Democrats, “We don’t want a wall, we want drones flying.” Oh that helps us a lot, drones, so you can watch everybody pour in to our country, right?
Donald Trump: (30:54)
Biden supports cutting police funding and he has pledged to end cash bail. Just last week Sleepy Joe proudly accepted the endorsement of the pro-criminal anti-police Portland District Attorney who has a policy of releasing rioters, vandals, criminals and violent extremists without charge. Now last night though, they arrested more than they’ve ever done because we said you have to. We said you have to and we told them about … We will federalize them, we’ll do whatever you need and I spoke to the governor, it looks like they’re finally, after 107 days, like they’re finally doing what they’re supposed to be doing but we’ll let you know very soon. Otherwise we’re going in.
Donald Trump: (31:38)
The Biden-Bernie manifesto pledges to implement these same policies nationwide. Now you got to understand, Bernie’s a radical lefty but not as bad as her but a radical left and I got a lot of Bernie voters. I think 15% last time because they agree with me on trade. They understand that many of these countries including our so-called allies are ripping us off, they’re ripping us off on trade. I agree with him on that. The difference is I know how to do something about it, they don’t. They don’t have a clue. They just know they’re being ripped off, and a lot of Bernie people feel that. That’s a big point and they came over and they voted for me instead of Crooked Hillary which was a very nice thing. We appreciate it, we hope we don’t lose it.
Donald Trump: (32:21)
Because we’ve really implemented things. We’ve taken in billions and billions and billions of dollars for China, from China, and China’s never given us $0.10. It’s a one-way street with China. They haven’t given us … We signed a great trade deal but the ink wasn’t dry when the plague came in so I view that trade deal much differently than I did before, much differently. It’s a great deal. They just last week, they ordered the biggest order of corn in history, the biggest order of soybeans in history, and I say just shows you though they’re smart, very smart. Instead of saying he’s not talking very nicely about us and we’re not going to order any more, we’re not going to do business, no. Instead they do the opposite. They give us the biggest orders … Our farmers are very happy. Our farmers are very happy. Biggest order of corn, biggest order of beef, biggest order of soybeans, and I gave the farmers $28 billion because that’s what you were targeted for by China and I gave you 28 out of the tariffs and we had tens of billions of dollars left over which went into the U.S. Treasury but nobody’s ever done this before. Nobody’s ever done this before. With Biden it’s the reverse. His son goes, sits down for 10 minutes with the father and whoever the hell they sat down with. Walks out with one and a half billion dollars to manage, he’ll make millions of dollars a year, and he has no experience at all. Never happened before. Biden’s plan is to appease the domestic terrorists. My plan is to arrest them.
Donald Trump: (33:51)
So on November 3 America faces a very simple choice. Do what you want, vote for the candidate backed by violent left wing rioters if you have to, or do what you want to vote for the candidate backed by the selfless heroes of law enforcement and just about everybody else. Wait till you see the numbers. Wait till you see the numbers.
Donald Trump: (34:16)
You know there was a poll that just came out, I think it was Gallup, and it was a weird kind of a poll because it said 62% of the people that are polled are lying. I said, “That’s a big number, right?” I think it was 62% a couple of weeks ago it came out, and they’re only lying if it’s us because they don’t want to be bothered. In other words they’re not lying about Sleepy Joe, they’re lying about us, and I don’t know if I’m supposed to love that or hate it, I don’t know if it’s an insult or not but I will take it. We don’t give a damn. If that’s the case, we have a virtual landslide going. We have a virtual landslide and this would look like it.
Donald Trump: (35:05)
We’re joined tonight by some really great friends of mine, representatives, senators, just some incredible people. People that have really helped me and we have to get them in office and let’s start off with Senator Thom Tillis. Thom, thank you. He’s been by my side. Thank you Thom very much. Representatives Greg Murphy, Virginia Foxx, Mark Walker, Dan Bishop, and Ted Budd, what a group. What a group. What a group, thank you fellas. They’re warriors. Boy I’ll tell you, those House guys, they were in there, they were fighting for us. We’re 196 to nothing, right? When Crazy Nancy impeached us, right? They impeached me for making a phone call that was perfect, it was a perfect call. I’ll go down as the only president in history that got impeached for making an absolutely perfect phone call. Thank goodness I had the call because they totally misrepresented what was on the calla. If you ever heard the Shifty Schiff get up in Congress and say what I said, [inaudible 00:36:17] it would have been terrible, but you know what? Fortunately we had really talented people taking down everything word for word. We had the call perfectly and if I didn’t have it, somehow with these people I guess I’d still be here if you want to know the truth, but it was a lot easier but we were 196 to nothing, the Republicans stuck together, and Kevin McCarthy’s done a fantastic job. He really has.
Donald Trump: (36:47)
With the exception of a half a vote from Mitt Romney, you can have him. He’s not too popular, I want to tell you, he’s not a very popular guy in Utah. He’s not too popular. So it was 52.5 to a half. He’s a beauty, I’ll tell you that guy. He couldn’t get elected dogcatcher in Utah right now. Remember Utah, they said it’s too close to call, this was before the election, and they announced Utah, the polls are closed, Donald Trump has won the state of Utah. Do you remember that like immediately? I won by a lot and there was some guy running, McMuffin, McMuffin. McMuffin, he was supposed to be second. Even Hillary beat him. What a group.
Donald Trump: (37:35)
Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, Dan? Get out and vote for him. Get out and vote for him, okay? I’ll tell you he’ll be a great governor. He loves your state, he’ll be a great governor. Thom is going to be a great, great senator for another six years, we need them both and I hope you’re going to do well, Dan. I know you’re really getting up there, it’s getting very close. I’ll be honest, if this governor that you have, I know him. You know we had to take our convention away, he said you’re allowed to have 10 people in the arena, 10, because it said one room 10, you’re not supposed to have political rallies. I said, “You know the money that your state is going to be losing?” But if this guy doesn’t open up your state, because almost all of them are open now, if he doesn’t open up your state, you have no choice, you’re going to vote for him anyway but Dan, you’ll be so good. Dan Forest, go and vote.
Donald Trump: (38:37)
The Republican nominee for North Carolina Attorney General, Jim O’Neill. Jim? Where is Jim? Thank you Jim, thank you very much. Good luck. Got to be careful with those ballots, watch those ballots. I don’t like it, you know you have a Democrat governor, you have all these Democrats watching that stuff. I don’t like it. I look at these crowds and if they’re going to cheat crowds are meaningless. Really, if they’re going to cheat, these big beautiful crowds, you could have 15,000, you could have 50,000, these crowds are meaningless. Watch it, be poll watchers when you go there. Watch all the thieving and stealing and robbing they do. Because this is important, we win North Carolina, we win. We’re going to win Florida, I just left Florida, we’re going to win Florida.
Donald Trump: (39:29)
North Carolina Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley North Carolina, great. Thank you Michael. Thank you, great job, and a very good friend of mine, a great guy, Mick Mulvaney. Where’s Mick? Oh, I didn’t know Mick was here. Look at him. What a good guy. Thank you Mick. We have a lot of big shots over there I see but what do you think about a guy named Mark Meadows, chief of staff? We love Mark. Doing a great job. He’s doing a great job, Robert O’Brien. Robert, how many hostages have you and I negotiated to get back, not giving anything but we have a record of what, Robert? 50, 50 and 0. We’re 50 and 0 on hostages. We got them back, we got hostages back from countries that you’d never even heard of and it’s been pretty amazing. Robert, thank you very much and thank you all for being here. Mick it’s good to see you.
Donald Trump: (40:45)
Oh wait a minute, wait. It’s a very, very outstanding senator. Oh I’m lucky I got to see that. We love South Carolina, right? Come here. Lindsey Graham everybody, Lindsey Graham. Lindsey and Tim Scott, two great ones. Two great ones. They may be from a different state but they love you Lindsey. That’s good and Tim is another one. So we have just incredible people in the party. We’ve achieved more in four years than anyone ever thought possible and that’s driving them crazy. We passed massive tax cuts like nobody ever thought was possible for hardworking families and we eliminated a record number of job-killing regulations, more than any president in history whether it was four years, eight years or in one case more, regulations, and to keep family farms in the family, we eliminated the unfair estate tax also known as the death tax on your small farms and businesses. Remember, that was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that, your family lost the farm, lost –
Donald Trump: (42:03)
That was a terrible thing. People were fighting for that. Your family lost the farm, lost their small business because they had to go and pay this ridiculous estate tax or death tax as they call it. And now you don’t have to worry about it. If you love your children, you leave it to them. If you don’t love your children, then it doesn’t matter what I did. Don’t leave it to them, give it to charity, give it to someone else. If they’re not good to you, if you don’t love… But does anybody here not love their children? Please raise your hand. You. Nobody. Good. I love that. Look at that one. You’re going to love that one, I guarantee. I guarantee you’re going to love that one. That’s a keeper. That’s a keeper, right? That’s great. You’ll love that one. Someday in a long time from now that beautiful child will not have to worry about estate taxes unless the Democrats do something in between, but we [inaudible 00:42:53].
Donald Trump: (42:55)
No, but it was a terrible thing. You’d pass away and your kids would get the farm, they’d go out and borrow a lot of money because the estate tax was massive. They’d put big mortgages on the farm, they’d lose the farm, they’d lose the business. You don’t have that anymore. I saved the US auto industry by withdrawing from the last administration’s job-killing catastrophe, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was a disaster. For half a century, Joe Biden shook hands with blue collar workers, and then he turned around and immediately stabbed them in the back. Biden supported NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, TPP, the South Korea disaster deal and mass amnesty for illegal aliens. Think of it. But the big deal is, he’s changed. He’s changed. “After 47 years I’ve changed. I swear to you I’ve changed.” Did you see him in the debates? He was not too good, but that’s okay. He was better against Bernie. Something’s going on there, I don’t know. You know what I’m talking about. But he was better against Bernie.
Donald Trump: (44:03)
But in the other debates, he was giving them everything they want. Free healthcare for people that come into the country illegally, colleges, everything. Now the new deal, under the new deal, they get lawyers. If they come in to our country illegally, we supply them with legal advice. You believe it lawyers? This is what we need, is more lawyers. This state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization. That’s courtesy of Biden and his friends. Earlier this year, I kept my promise to North Carolina when we ended the NAFTA nightmare and we signed the brand new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, it’s been incredible. Everyone said, “Impossible.” They all said it was impossible to get done, we got it done.
Donald Trump: (44:57)
And it’s a great deal. And it prevents people, it prevents companies from fleeing your state, opening up in Mexico or Canada, making a product, selling it to us with… It’s such a disincentive to do that. Now that was the thing that was most important to me. I used to hate when I’d see all these companies leaving our country, going to Mexico in particular, but Canada also, a lot of them going to Canada and they’d make a product, everybody gets fired in our country, they close their business and they make the same product in a different country, they send it back to us, no tax at the border, no tariff, no nothing. It doesn’t work that way anymore. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s pillaging, plundering, ransacking, and rampant theft of North Carolina jobs and US jobs. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China, my agenda is made in the USA.
Donald Trump: (45:50)
In the face of China’s economic aggression, we provided a historic $28 billion in relief to our amazing farmers. I will always stand with American agriculture. These are the greatest people, the finest people, and we’re not going to let others take advantage of them. For 20 years, for 20 years, you look at a chart, it’s just been this way for 20 years. Now, it’s going back up. I mean, it helped that I gave you $28 billion in all fairness, right? If I didn’t do that, and I took it all from China, it was very easy. If I didn’t do that, I think you wouldn’t have any farmers right now. Really. It was a difference between having farmers that are doing well and having no farmers. 28 billion over two years, they got hit one year, 16 billion, one year 12 billion. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, an ex-farmer, governor of Georgia for eight years, great guy. I said, “Sonny, how much are they being targeted for?” He said, “Sir, $12 billion for the year before, and last year sir was 16.”
Donald Trump: (47:14)
So I said, “28, okay, that’s fine.” I said, “We will give them 28 billion. They were unfairly targeted.” And that was in order to get me, and by the way, China wants Joe Biden so badly. Oh, they want… And you know who else would like them very badly? Iran would like them very badly. Because I ended that Iran catastrophe that we paid 150 billion and 1.8 billion, in cash. And you know what’s going to happen? They’re just waiting for the election because the country is going down the tubes. Their GDP went down 24%. Nobody ever heard of that before. Their country is in trouble. I don’t want them to be in trouble, but they’re going to wait till after the election. When I win the election, they’re going to come to us and make a deal so fast. Watch how fast it’ll be.
Donald Trump: (48:04)
They’re dying to make a deal, but they do want to wait. “Let’s wait two months, maybe we’ll get lucky. Maybe we’re going to get lucky and Slow Joe gets in and we’re going to make a great deal.” No, there’ll be in immediately after the election and they’ll make a deal, we’ll make a fair deal with them. But what Obama did and Biden did with that horrible Iran deal. I ended last administration’s war on American energy. Biden has pledged to end production of American oil shale, clean coal, no fracking, wiping out millions of jobs and forcing us to buy energy from foreign polluters. We don’t want to buy energy. We’ve done that for a long time, for decades and decades. We don’t want to do that anymore. I like being energy independent, don’t you? And I’m sure that most of you notice when you go to fill up your tank of gas in your car, oftentimes it’s below $2. You said, “How the hell did this ever happen? Thank you President Trump.” Right? Thank you President Trump
Donald Trump: (49:06)
And look at your electric bills, everything else. These guys, your electric would go up four, five, six times. The Green New Deal, it’s called the green new nightmare. While I’m president, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on earth and we will remain energy independent. It should be for many, many years to come. Because the fact is, we don’t have to be in the Middle East other than we want to protect Israel. We’ve been very good to Israel. But other than that, we don’t have to be in the Middle East. We don’t need… There was a time we needed desperately, we don’t need that anymore. We have more than they do, isn’t that nice? After years of rebuilding other countries, we are finally building our country. America first. It’s America first. To bring hope to our inner cities, I created opportunities zones. I worked with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, what a great guy. He has passed criminal justice reform, prison reform, delivered permanent funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities that Obama never did, or couldn’t do. And Biden. I call it Obiden. O Biden. It’s too long to say Obama and Biden, just call it Obiden.
Donald Trump: (50:35)
And before the China virus, we achieved the lowest African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates ever recorded. And we’re heading back to that level rapidly. Biden spent the last 47 years betraying African American voters. He betrayed them. Look at 1994, take a look at that. He betrayed them, what he did to them. He closed the factories in Baltimore and sent them to Beijing. They were all sent to Beijing. So many people went there. They went to all parts of the world, but a lot went to Beijing. He shattered the plants in Chicago and sent them to Shanghai. Unlike the previous administration, under my administration we put America first. And actually, if we weren’t interrupted with constant investigations that went nowhere. And nobody has been through what I’ve been through as president of the United States, nobody. They used to say Abraham Lincoln got the worst press. I said, “There’s no way he got worse than me.” But Lincoln was very, very badly treated by the fake news. Maybe in his case, it was real. I can tell you, in my case, it’s fake. It’s totally fake. But nobody’s been and should never be allowed to happen again. Let’s see what happens. We caught them cold. Let’s see what happens. But if we didn’t have to… That takes time, and energy, and all other things.
Donald Trump: (52:11)
The time that we spent on this impeachment hoax, Nancy Pelosi with her hairdryer and the whole thing. “Everybody has to wear a mask. You must keep all beauty parlors closed.” Then she’s in a beauty parlor with no mask on. And then she said the biggest, the biggest [inaudible 00:10:31]. She could have said, “Okay.” She could have said, “You got me.” But she said, “I got set up by the beauty parlor owner,” who happens to be a Trump person by the way. I like the beauty parlor owner. She said, “I got set up by the owner of the beauty parlor. She set me up.” I said, “How are you going to deal with Putin, Kim Jong-un, and President Xi of China?” No, it’s terrible, she’s always preaching about the mask. “You got to wear the mask at all times, indoor, outdoor. When you go to bed at night, put the mask on.” I’ve spent the last four years keeping my promises and delivering for the African American community and when I’m reelected the best is yet to come. I’ll tell you that. Perhaps in no area have our opponents more thoroughly betrayed working families of all backgrounds than on the subject of immigration. Under my administration, we’ve achieved the most secure border in American history. Now, I have to tell you the 300 miles of wall helps a lot. Remember they said, “Walls are old fashioned. They don’t work.” Really? I always say, and I’ve said it four or five times. I’ll say it again if you’d like me to, two things if you come back in a thousand years, 2000 years, or 3000 years. If you’re lucky enough, assuming we have something with the world is a crazy place, isn’t it? But if you come back in a thousand years, there are two things, with all the computers, and all the everything changes every day, you invent a new cell, you invent a new laptop. Everything is obsolete like about two weeks after you invent it, right? Two things that will never get obsolete, the wall and the wheel, right? The wheel and the wall.
Donald Trump: (54:51)
Maybe I’m wrong, who knows? But I would say walls and wheels have a great future. We ended catch and release, stopped asylum fraud, and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members, including the radical MS-13. We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States Military, all made in the USA by the way, We have the newest, finest military we’ve ever had, and gave our great warriors their largest pay raises in many, many decades. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability which everybody said could not happen, and veterans satisfaction with the VA has just reached 91%, the highest satisfaction level in history. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal as I said, and I kept my promise and recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the United States embassy in Jerusalem. And then I recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and we achieved the first breakthrough in the Middle East peace for many, many decades, decades.
Donald Trump: (56:17)
Even the New York Times said that was an amazing achievement. Do you believe that? I said, “Let me see that one.” Now we did something that nobody thought was possible. Man, it’s Israel, as you see, and as you’ve read, Israel and UAE, highly respected leader, Mohammed, highly, highly respected, and now we have other countries in the Middle East. They all want to come in. It’s going to be a beautiful picture, going to be a beautiful picture. We killed the vicious founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, we killed him. Why didn’t Biden get him?k They were after him for eight years, they never got him, I got him.
Donald Trump: (57:01)
The world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American crews, Qasem Soleimani, we got him too. Soleimani. Al-Baghdadi and Soleimani, the two worst terrorists in the world for many, many years, many decades. We kept America out of new wars and we’re bringing our troops back home. We’re bringing them back home from all these far away places. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and what do we get out of it? Biden voted for the Iraq war, he supported the defense sequester that gutted our military, he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden, he opposed the killing of Soleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and for eight years he couldn’t find or kill al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS. Couldn’t find him, they looked, they couldn’t find him. I found him and we hit him good. We hit him good. And you saw the Mueller family on television. You saw that at the convention, what al-Baghdadi did with their beautiful daughter, and incredible how our troops handled that. You should see it, it was incredible.
Donald Trump: (58:24)
Biden also cheered the rise of China as a positive development, positive development for America and for the world. How are we doing with China? We just have the plague, we’ve had other plagues sent by them. I wonder if they did it on purpose, what do you think? I got to tell you, I was sailing to an easy election. This was going to be so easy. I probably would have not been here tonight. I would have said, “No, we don’t have to bother. This is going to be…” And now we have to work against a guy that doesn’t know where he is, I can’t believe it. When I banned travel from China, Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. Do you remember that? I banned it. Everybody told me, “No, no, no, you don’t have to do that.” But I said, “We have to because Wuhan is very infected and they’re coming here,” so I banned it. Later on it was said to be a great move.
Donald Trump: (59:16)
If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. If Biden wins, China will own America, and it won’t take long, with his son, Hunter walking out with all of that money with no experience whatsoever, no investment…He didn’t even have a job. Joe Biden is weak and will always cave to China who is strong. When the virus arrived, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. We’re delivering life-saving therapies and we have achieved some of the great numbers. The case fatality rates, we have the lowest of any major country in the world. People don’t know that because the fake news doesn’t want to write about it. Under Operation Warp Speed, we’re producing a vaccine in record time. This is a vaccine that we’re going to have very soon, very, very soon, by the end of the year, but much sooner than that, perhaps. And this is something that’s incredible. This would have taken two or three years by the last administration, and in all fairness, by most other administrations. We have upped it to a level that nobody even believes is possible, and totally safe.
Donald Trump: (01:00:27)
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, rated the most liberal, are undermining science and risking countless lives with their reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric. That’s what they’re talking about. So now they know we have it. It’s only a question of weeks or a small amount of time. So instead of saying, “That’s a great thing. We’re going to save lives,” they’re trying to disparage it, they’re trying to make it politics. They’re trying to do so. And now what’s going to happen is we’ll have it, and people won’t want to take it. That’s really bad. Okay? That’s really bad. But the Biden-Harris effort to spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories only because they know we’re close to putting it out, getting it out, and we’re going to get it out fast. The vaccine will be safe. These are the greatest companies in the world to do this, the greatest labs, the greatest doctors, it’ll be effective and it’ll be delivered before the end of the year. And maybe as I said, much sooner than that.
Donald Trump: (01:01:23)
Joe Biden’s plan to impose a blanket shutdown would collapse our economy and cause countless deaths from suicide, drugs, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and much more. And that’s what you’re in right now. You’re in a shutdown. It’s crazy. I’ve been to many states, they’re not in shutdowns and they’re doing better. They’re doing better. Somebody’s got to speak to this man, Dan. Maybe you got to talk to him, Dan. Go in a little early and say, “You don’t know what the hell you’re doing? You don’t know what you’re doing. They’re hurting our people.” North Carolina has to open up. By contrast, my administration is following the science, protecting those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk to safely return to work and to school, go back to school, go back to school.
Donald Trump: (01:02:18)
You ever see the statistics on young people? I don’t know. They have a great immune system. Let’s get some of that immune system, but they’re amazing. I mean, thousands and thousands of people and they’re not even affected, very little meaning a small percentage of 1%. It’s an incredible thing. Nobody knew that when it first came here, nobody assumed a thing like that was possible. But young people are very strong against this horrible disease. Through our historic China virus relief programs, we’ve saved more than 1.3 million jobs for North Carolina workers. That worked out great. We provided $380 million in relief for North Carolina farmers and made $10 million in PPP loans to save-
Donald Trump: (01:03:03)
… And made $10 million in PPP loans to save your state’s tobacco growers. We saved your tobacco growers. We have them very much in our sites. We want to help them. The Biden agenda would crush this comeback and put our families in grave danger. Biden is promising to reimpose job-destroying regulations. We got rid of more regulations, he wants to put those regulations back plus 50%. You couldn’t build a road. We took roads from 18, 19, and even 20 years approval down to two and we’ll have it down to one. You may get rejected for a highway or for a road, but you’re going to know in the period of 12 months to 24 months. You’re not going to spend an entire lifetime and then have them raise their hand. I know all about it from the real estate business, we brought it all the way down.
Donald Trump: (01:03:52)
He wants to give illegal aliens government healthcare and taxpayer funded lawyers, establish a national sanctuary city policy for illegal aliens with criminal records. You wouldn’t believe. I mean, this stuff is not even really believable, but it is what it is. He wants to surge refugee admissions by 700% into our country. Flooding your towns with poorly vetted migrants, including many from jihadist regions of the world. Biden opposes school choice, he opposes North Carolina opportunity scholarships. And he has stated that if he is elected, charter schools are gone. He said, they’re gone. And they’ve been incredible.
Donald Trump: (01:04:35)
In the second term I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America. And we’ll also take good care of our teachers. Our teachers are very, very important to me. Very important, nothing more important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And just in finishing, I have to say that over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We’ll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will enact fair trade deals that create American jobs and grow American wages. We are going to bring our companies back home where they should be. I’ve been doing a lot of it, but we are going to do it at a level that nobody ever thought possible. We will rapidly return to full employment, soaring wages, and record prosperity. We will hire more police, increased penalties for assaults or law enforcement, surge, federal prosecutors into high crime communities and ban all sanctuary cities. We will protect government benefits for American citizens, not for illegal aliens. What you’re doing when you have all of these advantages, when you’re giving them free healthcare, and free lawyers, and free college, and free everything, they all come. They didn’t think of coming, but they see this, they talk and they talk to their friends and they all come in. They want to come to America. You’re just bringing people in and we don’t want to do that. We want people to come to our country, but they have to come in through merit and they have to come in legally, very simple.
Donald Trump: (01:06:32)
We will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the law, not their own political agenda. We will ensure equal justice for the citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. We will defend the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless ridiculous foreign wars. We’ll build up our military like it’s never been built up before. We need our military for other reasons. We will have the strongest we have now. When I took over, our military was depleted. We have a lot of military people here. Our military was depleted, our planes were 50 years old. Now you have brand new, beautiful F35s, we have brand new rockets and missiles. And hopefully we never have to use them, I will say that. But the best way of not having to use them is to have them. If you have them… We learned that in the school yards, right? We learned that in the school yards, the best way is to have them. We have the strongest military we’ve ever had by far.
Donald Trump: (01:08:03)
We’ll end surprise medical billing require, price transparency, which I’ve already signed into law, which by the way, kicks in on January 1st. You better elect me North Carolina. I did price transparency and I’ve cut the price. Drugs are going to start going down at levels nobody’s ever seen favored nations. So we did price transparency, kicks in January 1st. Could you imagine if this guy’s president and your prices start to go way down, hospitalization, doctors, you can choose your own doctor unlike with Obama, right? Price is going way down, January 1st. I said, couldn’t you start it sooner, but statutorily that’s when it had it start. Could you imagine if this guy’s in and prices start dropping like a rock? And they’ll say, What a great president he is. He would have never done it. And your drug prices, prescription drug, I’m instituting favorite nations laws. So we’re going to pay what other nations pay at the lowest. And you’rr going to get back rebates that were given to middlemen who have to be the richest people in the world.
Donald Trump: (01:09:20)
We’ll protect medicare and social security, and we will protect your social security. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions, always. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. Very exciting. And I will reopen NASA. That place was gone. They had grass growing out of the runways, you had to see it. Now it’s the number one space center in the world by far. You see what’s going on. We will restore patriotic education to our schools. Oh, you know what I’m talking about. Look at you. This is a very sophisticated group, Tom. You know what I’m talking about, patriotic education. Well, the first thing they do is they want to take your history away. That’s a great group behind me. I don’t know. They’re activists. But you know what? You know what it means, they want to take away your history. That’s why the monuments and the statutes, they want to knock them down. The first thing they do is take away your guts. It’s guts. They take away your guts, they take away your statues, they take away your heroes. They take away your great generals. They take away your past. And I said, it was going to happen. I said, “You know what? They started off with generals and colonels and others that nobody ever heard of.” And I thought that was bad. And then they went up a little bit and now I said, “Someday it’s going to be Robert Lee, someday it’s going to be Washington, someday it’s going to be Lincoln. Someday it’s going to be Jefferson, someday it’s going to be Benjamin Franklin. It’s all of them. They take away your past. They never taken away our past. That’s the way they do it. You study it. That’s the way they go. They take away your guts.
Donald Trump: (01:11:45)
We’ll teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God we trust. This is better than the arenas, I have to say, especially when you have a crowd like this. But they’re like this. They have such spirit in this country. People love our country so much. I went to Texas, I went to Ohio, I went to Florida, it’s always like this. They love our country and we’re not going to disappoint anybody. We’re not disappointed. For years you had a president who apologized for America… So you had a president who apologized for America, now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of North Carolina. This is the most important election in the history of our country. I wouldn’t say that lightly. And frankly, I thought the last one was, and I said it, but they’ve gone to a level that nobody even thought possible. These people have gotten stone cold, crazy. And you know what? After we get in, we’re going to have tremendous success. And it was building. We were at a point, we were so successful before the plague came in from China. We were so successful that we were starting to get together. People forget. We were starting… Success brings people together. It was so good. Our jobs numbers were so good. And whether it was the Black community, the Hispanic community, the Asian community, our jobs were so good, our numbers were so good. We were getting together and then the plague came in and we had to stop. We had to close it up. We had to open it and start all over again.
Donald Trump: (01:14:24)
If you would have told me that we have one of the highest stock market, some of the stock markets have already broken every record. You look at NASDAQ, you look at some… We’re far ahead of what I had planned. We’re far ahead of schedule. But we did it once, we have to do it again because this was an unforeseen event, a terrible event, a horrible event. So many people died. Nobody should have died, not one person. So many people died, but if we didn’t do it right, we would have lost millions of people. Just a terrible thing. But oftentimes I say, bring people together. And then I realized, if you look at that last few months, we were starting to come together. I was getting calls from, you won’t believe it, Democrats. I was getting calls from Democrats and they were saying, “Wow, things are going really well.” It was starting to happen and now we have to get it back to a level of great success because it’ll happen again. There’ll be great unity, eventually there’ll be great unity.
Donald Trump: (01:15:23)
So get your friends, and get your family, get your neighbors, and your coworkers and vote. And I say this because it’s from Charlotte to Kitty Hawk, from Durham to Asheville, and from Wilmington to right here in Winston-Salem. We inherit the legacy of North Carolina Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, one, two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater than ever before. Proud and great citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of North Carolina, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you North Carolina. Thank you. (singing)"

Thank you very much. We had a very successful day. Pennsylvania was incredible. The crowd was incredible. You saw what was unable to get in. We had thousands of people unable to get in. And I appreciate everybody being there. That was really a terrific moment, I think, coming off the plane. It doesn’t get any bigger than that. I did hear though, when reentering the plane, I was told by Mark and Hope and some others that some horrible things were said. Fake things. Fake news. Corrupt news. The kind of news that’s ruining your profession. And everyone knows it’s totally false. General Keith Kellogg, who’s a highly respected man, couldn’t believe when he heard it. And he knows everything about all of it. And to think that I would make statements negative to our military and our fallen heroes when nobody’s done what I’ve done with the budgets, with the military budgets, with getting pay raises for our military. It is a disgraceful situation by a magazine that’s a terrible magazine. I don’t read it, but I just heard about it.
Donald Trump: (01:48)
They made it up, and probably it’s a couple of people that have been failures in the administration that I got rid of, and I couldn’t get rid of them fast enough. Or it was just made up. But it’s unthinkable. As far as John McCain is concerned, I was never a fan. I will admit that openly. I disagreed with him on the endless wars. I disagreed with him with respect to the vets and the taking care of the VA. I wanted to do it a much different way, and I think it’s proven to be a much more successful way when you look at the success we’ve had with the VA and with our vets with choice and with accountability, all the things I’ve got. So I disagreed with John McCain, but I still respected him. And I had to approve his funeral as president. We lowered the flags. I had to approve that. Nobody else. I had to approve it.
Donald Trump: (02:38)
When you think, and I’m just thinking back, I had to approve either Air Force One or a military plane to go to Arizona to pick up his casket. I approved it immediately. I had to approve the funeral because he had a first-class AAA funeral that lasted for nine days, by the way. I had to approve it. All of that had to be approved by the president. I approved it without hesitation, without complaint. And I felt he deserved it. I disagreed with him on things, and he was a tough guy, but I felt he deserved it. For somebody to say the things that they say I said is a total lie. It’s fake news. It’s a disgrace. And frankly, it’s a disgrace to your profession. Now, with all of that being said, you’ll speak to Keith Kellogg. You’ll speak to other people, because many people knew.
Donald Trump: (03:34)
Let me just go into the trip to Europe and to France. I was ready to go to a ceremony. I had two of them, one the following day. It was pouring. I went to that. But the helicopter could not fly. The reason it couldn’t fly, because it was ranting about as hard as I’ve ever seen. And on top of that, it was very, very foggy, and the helicopter was unable to fly. It was a fairly long helicopter flight, but it was a very long drive. In order for me to go, we would have had to leave immediately and go through very busy areas of, I guess, Paris, but a very, very heavily traveled area, a big city. I think it was Paris. The Secret Service told me, “You can’t do it.” I said, “I have to do it. I want to be there.” They said, “You can’t do it. We’ll get you confirmation of this. For you to do that, make that trip not by helicopter flying over everything, we have to work with the police. We have to work with everything.”
Donald Trump: (04:39)
And I think you’ll find on record in the police force in the areas that we’re talking about, areas of Paris that we’re talking about, I think you’ll find on record requests, and we actually have Secret Service that I’m going to ask to give you details. They said, “You can’t do it.” It was two and a half hours or two hours of driving. It was a long drive. They said, “You can’t do it.” So I said, “No, I want to do it.” They said, “You can’t.” There was no way I would’ve been able to do it. And they would never have been able to get the police and everybody else in line to have a president go through a very crowded, very congested area. So I went and I called home. I spoke to my wife. I said, “I hate this. I came here to go to that ceremony,” and to the one that was the following day, which I did go to. I said, “I feel terribly.” And that was the end of it.
Donald Trump: (05:34)
Now, all of a sudden, somebody makes up this horrible story that I didn’t want to go. And then they make up an even worse story, an even worse story calling certain names to our fallen heroes. It’s a disgrace that a magazine is able to write it. If they really exist, if people really exist that would have said that they’re low lives and they’re liars. And I would be willing to swear on anything that I never said that about our fallen heroes. There is nobody that respects them more. So I just think it’s a horrible, horrible thing. We made a great evening into, frankly, a very sad evening when I see a statement like that. No animal, nobody, what animal would say such a thing? And especially since I’ve done more, I think, than almost anybody to help our military, to get the budgets of our military, to get the pay raises for our military.
Donald Trump: (06:34)
I just think it’s a horrible thing that they’re allowed to write that. We can refute it. We have other people that will refute it. The one I would like you to speak to is General Keith Kellogg, because he knows exactly the story, but you can also speak to Secret Service. They wouldn’t let me go, no matter what happened, because of security, because of safety.
Donald Trump: (06:54)
I want to thank you for being here. There’s nothing much more that I could say. All they’re trying to do is influence a presidential election where we’ve gone very high in the polls in the last short period of time, where we’re doing very well, where we’re going to win, and they’re going crazy. The magazine in question is a never Trumper magazine, probably doing badly. I know nothing about it. I don’t read it. I just heard about it now, about this story. But it’s a total never Trumper magazine, and other people that are trying to influence the outcome of a presidential election. And you know what? People are to smart for it. And somebody has to make a stand. This fake press is a disgrace. Thank you very much, everybody."

Just closed out another month of stock market. We had the best stock market Dow in 36 years. That’s very impressive. So people are very happy with their 401Ks and with the stocks that they have, and that’s a tremendous achievement. Best in 36 years.
President Trump: (00:21)
Let me begin with a brief update on the China virus. Over the last month, our new cases in the United States have declined by 38%. Last week, we announced a breakthrough in testing that will allow us to have over 150 million rapid point of care tests. These tests return the results in less than 15 minutes, and many will be deployed to nursing homes. We’re focusing very strongly on nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other locations that serve high risk populations. So we’re going to have the 15 minutes and less tests, and we will have 150 million rapid point of care tests. That’s something.
President Trump: (01:04)
This evening I’m pleased to announce that AstraZeneca vaccine has reached phase three clinical trials, so that’s joining another group of vaccines that are very close to the end and hopefully approval. In the United States we’re doing things that nobody thought would have been even possible. This is a process that would have taken, in some cases, years, and we did it in a matter of months. Thanks to the efforts of Operation Warp Speed, we remain on track to deliver a vaccine very rapidly, in record time.
President Trump: (01:38)
I also want to provide an update on left-wing political violence that we’re seeing in Democrat-run cities. Under my administration, federal law enforcement is working with state and local authorities all over the country to comb through hours of video, track down rioters, looters, and arsonists and bring them to justice. We’ve just come up with a report that we’ve arrested a large number of people. It’s over 200. You’ll be hearing about that, but they’ve been arrested in various cities throughout the United States. We’re doing it very low key, but we’re trying to help cities. They are in all cases Democrat-run, but we’re doing the best we can to help them without really much of a consent. We’d like to have the consent, as an example, in Portland. We could solve that problem in approximately one hour, but the mayor refuses, perhaps for political reasons. I don’t know why it’s good for him to have a city that’s falling apart and that’s under siege now for 94 days. But really it’s been under siege for years, if you know Portland. So to the mayor I say whenever you’re ready, let us know. We’ll solve your problem of violence. We’ll solve your problem of crime. We’ll arrest those criminals very rapidly, and you’ll be able to have some nice evenings in Portland.
President Trump: (02:58)
The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice are announcing a joint operation center to investigate the violent left-wing, civil unrest. And again, in Portland alone, the federal government has already taken care of and arrested 100 rioters just in that one city. The wave of violence and destruction that we’ve seen in recent weeks and months has occurred in cities exclusively controlled and dominated by the Joe Biden party. If you take a look, the top 10 in the country are Democrats. It’s Democrat-run cities, and it’s a shame, and it can be solved very easily. The violence is fueled by dangers, rhetoric from far-left politicians that demonize our nation and demonize our police. We have to allow our police to do what they’re very good at doing. We’ve taken that power away. They’re afraid to lose their pension, their job, their everything. They’re afraid to be destroyed.
President Trump: (04:06)
You saw this when left-wing extremists attacked law-abiding citizens attending the Republican National Convention at the White House, including Senator Rand Paul and his wonderful wife, Kelly, what they went through. But other people went through it, too. And that was done very systematically. That was done on purpose. They knew we were having the convention, and they wanted to do everything they could to disrupt it. And the good news is the public is very wise to it. They see what’s happening and they’re wise to it, and I think they are probably acting accordingly. Left-wing rioters are repeating the same false narrative about America that you hear about the… Really, you hear this from people, what they’re saying, how they’re saying it, the violence, it’s terrible. And again, it’s Democrat politicians. I don’t know that they’re sparing it on, or they’re afraid to stop it. But in any event, we’re there to help. We’re there to get things under control.
President Trump: (05:07)
What they did on Thursday night at the White House, just outside of the White House, to people that came from all over the world is a disgrace. It’s a disgrace. And frankly, the mayor, Democrat mayor, Mayor Bowser should have done a better job. She did a very poor job, but at the same time we had the police who were very brave. They helped Rand. I guess it started off with two, and they took a beating, if you can believe this. They really took some heavy hits. One went down, but got right up, and two others joined them and they were able to get Rand and Kelly through. But it was a terrible, terrible thing to witness. But other people went through similar, not to the extent in terms of taping. We don’t have the tapes as strong, but some people went through, from what I heard, as bad or worse.
President Trump: (05:55)
The violent rioters share Biden’s same talking points, and they share his same agenda for our nation. And even his strange speech today that he made in Pittsburgh, it didn’t mention the fact… He didn’t mention the far-left. He didn’t mention the far-left or, from what I saw, I don’t believe he mentioned the word Antifa. Antifa is a criminal organization, and he didn’t mention Antifa thugs, but mostly seemed to blame the police and law enforcement. He went on point after point after point. He even talked about those on the right, but he didn’t talk about those on the left, and those on the left are. The problem and Antifa is the problem. The rioters and Joe Biden have a side. They’re both on the side of the radical left, and that is so obvious. And until that neutralizes, you’re never going to have safe areas in those Democrat-run areas.
President Trump: (06:54)
For months, Joe Biden has given moral aid and comfort to the vandals, repeating the monster’s lie that these were peaceful protests. They’re not peaceful protests. That’s anarchy. You look at the agitators. You look at the looters. You look at the rioters. That’s not a peaceful protest. They keep using the term. It’s so nice, peaceful protest, and behind the reporter the cities are burning. We could solve it very quickly if they ask us to come in, like we did in Minneapolis and like we just did in Wisconsin, where I’ll be going tomorrow. And at least the governor asked me if I could, we would. I said, “You got to get the National Guard.” And he finally agreed to even a small number, but they were able to take care of things. And that was about five days ago, six days ago, and ever since, it’s been very good.
President Trump: (07:46)
13 members of Biden’s campaign staff donated to bail and rioters, getting them out of jail. Looters, they got them out of jail. And his running mate, Kamala, urged their supporters to do the same thing. It’s outrageous that they’re now seeking to shift the blame for the mayhem, and they really want to put it on the backs of the police. I see it. There’s just a war on law enforcement in this country, and without law enforcement, we wouldn’t have a country. We have very talented people. They’re not allowed to do their job. If you give the radical left power, what you’re seeing in the Democrat-run cities will be brought to every city in this country. If they have that power, every city in this country could be potentially another Portland or another Chicago, where they’ve had such problems to defeat them. We must jail lawbreakers, and we must defeat their hateful ideology about this country, about America. We must teach our children that America is an exceptional, free, and just nation worth defending, preserving, and protecting, and that’s what we want to do. They want to destroy our country. They’re going to destroy our suburbs, but I think I’ve gone a long way from allowing that to happen. The suburbs are protected, especially with the rule changes that I made. I took them out of the Obama administration. They were going to be made much worse.
President Trump: (09:16)
What we’re witnessing today as a result of left-wing indoctrination in our nation’s schools and universities, many young Americans have been fed lies about America being a wicked nation, plagued by racism. Indeed, Joe Biden and his party spent their entire convention spreading this hateful and destructive message while refusing to say one word about the violence. They didn’t even discuss law enforcement, the police. Those words weren’t mentioned. Two words that were taken out were the words under God, under God. Two very important words in the Pledge of Allegiance, in their caucus. I guess they did it twice. They took it out of their Pledge of Allegiance. I heard it the one time, and I said, “That’s strange. That’s a big…” Tell you, I figured they maybe made a mistake, something happened. No, they didn’t make a mistake. Then they did it later on. So they essentially took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. We’re not taking the word God out of anything. We’re not taking it out of our Pledge of Allegiance, and we’re not taking the great word God out of anything.
President Trump: (10:25)
At our convention, we highlighted law enforcement heroes and repeatedly emphasized that violence has no place in American political discourse. The left’s war on police, faith, history, and American values is tearing our country apart, which is what they want. They think it’s good, but it’s gotten out of control. They’re unable to control this radical left crazy movement, but we can control it very quickly. Very, very quickly indeed. The only path to unity is to rebuild a shared national identity focused on common American values and virtues, of which we have plenty. This includes restoring patriotic education in our nation schools where they’re trying to change everything that we’ve learned. What we’ve learned, in fact, what most of you have learned, they want to change it. They want to change it for whatever reason, cancel culture, whatever you want to call it.
President Trump: (11:17)
At the same time, we must strictly and fully enforce our law and have no tolerance for anarchy and no tolerance, zero, for violence. Anyone who breaks the law should be arrested, prosecuted, and punished. This includes targeting law enforcement efforts to focus on Antifa, the left-wing domestic terror organization. The mission of Antifa is to spread terror in the US population with a goal of getting Americans to give up to their agenda. This is how terrorist organizations have always operated. Biden won’t even say the name Antifa. I don’t believe he said it today. He made a speech and he didn’t mention that. He mentioned others, but he didn’t mention Antifa. He mentioned law enforcement and mentioned the police, but he didn’t mention Antifa. I wonder why. And if he cannot name the problem, there’s no way that he’ll solve the problem. You don’t name it, you don’t solve it. In fact, Biden would give Antifa exactly what it wants, the far-left policy agenda it’s asking for. And if that happened, we don’t have much of a country left. If you give violent extremists what they want, the violence doesn’t go away. They gain new power to spread the terror nationwide.
President Trump: (12:38)
Most of our nation is extremely safe, by the way. You only see the bad. You see Portland and Chicago and you see what’s happened in New York, just in a very short period of time. It’s horrible what’s happened in New York. I love New York. I come from New York, and when I see… Four years ago I left, and I could see that it was problems under this mayor. He’s a terrible mayor, one of the worst. I can’t say the worst. I mean, I’ve witnessed Portland. Hard to top him, but he’s certainly one of the worst. And when I look at what’s happening in New York and I look at what’s happening in the city and so quickly. It happened so quickly. It’s a shame.
President Trump: (13:14)
Biden’s strategy is to surrender to the left-wing mob, which is exactly what he’s doing… I don’t think he even knows what he’s doing… and give them control over every lever of power in the United States government. But when you surrender the mob, you don’t get freedom. You get fascism. That’s what happens in all cases. You take a look at Venezuela. Look what’s gone on there and other places. Biden is using mafia talking points. The mob will leave you alone if you give them what you want. That’s what it is. The mob will leave you alone if give them what you want, but it doesn’t work that way. Because once you give them, they keep taking, taking, taking. What happens is you give and give and give and you take and they no longer respect you. And that’s what’s happened with the Democrats because I actually think they’ve lost control of these radical left, many X. I think they’ve lost control because I don’t think they feel that’s helping them when New York and Chicago and Portland, and you look at Oakland and you look at Baltimore and you look at so many different places and what’s going on there, the top 10 are all run by Democrats. And you can go a lot further down the list than 10.
President Trump: (14:28)
In America, we will never surrender to mob rule because if the mob rules, democracy is indeed dead. The reason we’re continuing to see violence in left-wing cities today is that liberal politicians, mayors, prosecutors, and judges are refusing to enforce the law and put the rioters in jail. These are rioters. These are dangerous people. These are killers. They kill a lot of people, and they don’t even think about it. They wake up the next morning, they don’t even think about it. This is the extreme left’s agenda for America. They want to appoint radical prosecutors, judges, and federal officials who will set criminals free. Their stated plan is to cut police funding, abolish cash bail, close down prisons, reeducate our children, preach left-wing social justice, establish a national sanctuary for criminal illegal aliens, and abolish the death penalty, even for cop killers. No one will be safe, and in fact, they want very much to let people in prison, like as an example, the Boston bomber, they want to let everybody vote. If you’re in prison, if you’re the Boston bomber, they want you to have a vote. I don’t know. I don’t think that sells too well.
President Trump: (15:46)
My administration has a very different approach. We want states to work with us to deploy the National Guard to quell the unrest. All they have to do is call us. We will have the National Guard… We’re prepared. We’re ready to go no matter where they may call from. Any part of the country, East coast, West coast, doesn’t matter. We’re ready to move immediately as we did in Minneapolis. We are ready to move as quickly as you can imagine. Tomorrow I’m going to a place where we move very quickly. You know that in Wisconsin and we move very, very quickly. And as soon as we move, that was the end of that. It was very well-behaved.
President Trump: (16:28)
I’ll appoint more tough on crime prosecutors, supports different penalties and longer jail terms for rioters, and support effective policing methods that are proven to be great crime reducers. When you enforce the law, order follows, and we need order. We need order. You can’t have cities run like these cities are run. They gave a little, then they gave a little, then they gave a little more, and all of a sudden they’ve lost these cities. But I’ll get them back very quickly. All they have to do is say, “Please come in.” As you know, they have to ask, unless we go a much tougher route, which we could, but you don’t like to do that. They have to ask you to come in. When they ask me to come in, we’ll be there within a matter of minutes. When I signed the executive order outlining 10 year prison sentences as an example for destroying monuments and statues, it immediately stopped. That was three months ago or so. I signed an order and it said 10 years in prison, 10 years if you knock down a statue. It immediately stopped. I mean, to the best of my knowledge. I haven’t seen it happening for about that time. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They canceled that march. They said 10 years is too long.
President Trump: (17:43)
Before the outbreak of left-wing extremism, our strategy produced a historic reduction in violent crime in the last two years. Of the Obama administration, murder increased 30% in major American cities. And we witnessed a largest two year nationwide increase in murder in over a half a century. In the first two years of my presidency, the number of murders went down significantly. Earlier this year, we announced that Operation Legend, surging federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime, and we did a lot of it. We did a lot of it very quietly, but we did a lot. Since the beginning of Operation Legend, we have conducted more than 1000 arrests and reduced the murder rate in Kansas City, which is one of the cities we targeted, by one third. Cut it down 33%. In the last month alone, we cut the murder rate in Chicago in half. People don’t know that, but we sent them in to Chicago without fanfare at all, but we cut it down in half. It’s still far too high. And if they’d asked for full help, as opposed to just sending in some very talented people, we’d be able to cut it down to a very low number.
President Trump: (18:57)
While I am president, we will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens. We will honor the heroes who keep America safe, and we do. We honor our police. We honor our law enforcement. I have the privilege of having gotten, I guess, most every law enforcement group in the country that I can think of, the sheriffs in Florida, all of them, law enforcement in Ohio, in Texas, North Carolina. I mean, almost no matter where you look, I think I’ve gotten all of it. We’ll have to do a little study so I’m totally accurate, but I would say all of it. And the ones who didn’t, I think we have to look at them. Where do they come from? So we’ve done a real job. We’re ready, willing, and able to help these Democrat-run cities that are doing poorly. They have to call and ask. All they have to do is call. They don’t even have to put it in writing. We’ll put it in writing later. We’ll get them in there, and we’ll straighten out the city very quickly, whichever city we may be talking about.
President Trump: (19:54)
So those governors that are responsible for a state that has a city that’s got a lot of problems, call me, or the mayor can call me, and we’ll be there very quickly. Tomorrow we’re making that trip to Wisconsin. I think a lot of you are going to be going, and it should be very interesting. It should be very interesting. But we’re proud of it because in six days it’s been like a different world. And it took place immediately. As soon as we surged, as soon as we went in, it took place immediately.
President Trump: (20:24)
Okay, please. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (20:25)
Mr. President, are you giving any consideration, or did you give any consideration to the governor and mayor’s request not to come to Kenosha tomorrow?
President Trump: (20:35)
No, because Kenosha was something we did a good job on. The governor didn’t want us there. He didn’t want the National Guard, as you know. He was very reluctant. But I give him credit because ultimately he said yes, and as soon as he said yes, the problem ended. But I have to see the people that did such a good job for me, and we’re meeting with numerous people. We have tremendous support in the state of Wisconsin, so I promised them when it all gets taken care of we’ll go.
Speaker 2: (21:01)
The mayor expressed concerns, though, that it could exacerbate tensions and increase violence. Do you give any consideration for that?
President Trump: (21:09)
Well, it could also increase enthusiasm, and it could increase love and respect for our country. And that’s why I’m going because they did a fantastic job. As soon as I called and told them, “Let’s go,” the whole problem stopped. That was, what, six days ago.
President Trump: (21:27)
Yeah, Jeff?
Jeff: (21:28)
Mr. President, why are you not meeting with the family of Jacob Blake while you’re there?
President Trump: (21:32)
Well, I spoke with the pastor, wonderful man, the family’s pastor, and I thought it would be better not to do anything where there are lawyers involved. They wanted me to speak, but they wanted to have lawyers involved, and I thought that was inappropriate so I didn’t do that. But I did speak with the pastor of the family who is a fine man, a wonderful man, and I think we had a great talk. I may at some point do that, but they did have a lawyer that wanted to be on the phone. And I said, “No, that’s inappropriate,” but I just gave my best regards. But again, I spoke with the pastor.
President Trump: (22:10)
Yeah, please.
Speaker 4: (22:11)
I have a question on coronavirus, but first, you were just criticizing Joe Biden, saying he didn’t mention far-left or Antifa. During his speech today you said you wanted to talk about left-wing political violence, but I noticed that you did not mention that your supporters were also in Portland this weekend firing paintball guns at people, some form of pepper spray. So do you want to also take this chance to condemn what your supporters did in Portland?
President Trump: (22:33)
Well, I understand they had large numbers of people that were supporters, but that was a peaceful protest. And paint as a defensive mechanism, paint is not bullets-
Speaker 4: (22:43)
It’s a paintball gun. It’s a bullet.
President Trump: (22:44)
Your supporters, and they are your supporters indeed, shot a young gentleman and killed him, not with paint, but with a bullet, and I think it’s disgraceful. These people, they protested peacefully. They went in very peacefully. And I’ll tell you what they’re protesting. They’re protesting… When they turn on television or read whatever they may be reading and they see a city like Chicago, where 78 people were shot and 13 died, or a city like New York, where the crime rate has gone through the roof, or a city like Portland, where the entire city is ablaze all the time and the mayor says, “We don’t want any help from the federal government,” when these people turn that on and they see that, they say, “This is not our country. This is not our country.” That was a peaceful protest, totally.
Speaker 4: (23:44)
That was a supporter of yours, Mr. President.
President Trump: (23:48)
Okay. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 4: (23:48)
It was a supporter of-
President Trump: (23:48)
Yeah, go ahead, please.
Speaker 4: (23:48)
It was a supporter of yours, Mr. President.
President Trump: (23:48)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 5: (23:48)
Aren’t you going to condemn the act-
Speaker 4: (23:48)
It was a supporter of yours, Mr. President-
President Trump: (23:48)
Excuse me?
Speaker 4: (23:48)
… who killed someone, that was accused of killing two people.
President Trump: (23:48)
Excuse me?
Speaker 5: (23:51)
To follow what the reporter is saying, are you going to condemn the actions of vigilantes like Kyle Rittenhouse?
President Trump: (23:54)
We’re looking at all of it. That was an interesting situation. You saw the same tape as I saw. He was trying to get away from them, I guess, it looks like, and he fell. And then they very violently attacked him, and it was something that we’re looking at right now, and it’s under investigation. But I guess he was in very big trouble. He probably would have been killed, but it’s under investigation.
Speaker 5: (24:26)
Do you think private citizens should be taking guns-
President Trump: (24:26)
I’d like to see law enforcement take care of everything. I think everything should be taken care of, law enforcement. But again, we have to give our cops back, our police back their dignity, the respect. They’re very talented people. They’re strong. They’re tough. They can do the job, but we’ve taken it away. We don’t want to have… When somebody makes a mistake, he chokes… Or in some cases you have bad cops, we have to take care of that. In other cases, they choke. They have a quarter of a second, a quarter of a second to make a decision. And sometimes they make the wrong decision. If they make the wrong decision, you know if they make the wrong decision in the other direction, they’re probably dead.
President Trump: (25:03)
So they choke sometimes, and that goes on the evening news for weeks. And the thousands and tens of thousands of great things they do, nobody covers that. Nobody writes about that. But if they make a mistake… And again, the bad cops, everybody agrees, they have to be very tough on bad cops. But sometimes you have a cop or a police person who is a good police person, right? Good, but they choke. The timing and they go through this and they study this and they work on it all the time. They literally have a quarter of a second to make some of these decisions. And they make a wrong decision, and it’s very devastating.
President Trump: (25:46)
But I will say this, I honor law enforcement. We wouldn’t be here right now if it wasn’t for law enforcement. We have to stop this horrible left-wing ideology that seems to be permeating our country. And basically, it’s weakness. It’s weakness on behalf of Democrat politicians. The Republicans, we don’t have problems. You take a look at our cities, our cities are doing very well. They’re safe. They’re secure. I spent a lot of time in Texas, as you know, just a couple of days ago. I was with the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, he was explaining they wouldn’t put up with it for a minute. They just don’t have the kind of problems that other people have. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. [crosstalk 00:26:27]
Speaker 4: (26:26)
Mr. President, I’d like to finish my question, if you could come back, please, since you did not really finish my question, Mr. President."
"Aug 27, 2020",3:58 P.M. EDT,"Speaker 2: (00:00)
(singing)
President Donald Trump: (02:06)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
President Donald Trump: (02:15)
Friends, delegates, and distinguished guests, please. I stand before you tonight honored by your support, proud of the extraordinary progress we have made together over the last four incredible years and blooming with confidence in the bright future we will build for America over the next four years.
President Donald Trump: (02:43)
We begin this evening, our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have just come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura. We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago.
President Donald Trump: (03:24)
And this is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. And congratulations, thank you for that great job out there. We really appreciate it. We are one national family, and we will always protect, love, and care for each other. Here tonight are the people who have made my journey possible and filled my life with so much joy.
President Donald Trump: (04:00)
For her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent first lady. Thank you sweetheart. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children. Ivanka, please stand up. Thank you. And to all of my children and grandchildren, I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from heaven. He was a great brother, and was very proud of the job we are all doing. Thank you. We love you, Robert.
President Donald Trump: (05:13)
Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side and stood up for our values, a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction, our vice president, Mike Pence. And Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence. Thank you, Karen.
President Donald Trump: (06:05)
My fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for President of the United States.
President Donald Trump: (06:44)
The Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, independents, and anyone who believes in the greatness of America and the righteous heart of the American people.
President Donald Trump: (07:11)
In the new term as president, we will again build the greatest economy in history, quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes and record prosperity. We will defend America against all threats and protect America against all dangers. We will lead America into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach four new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can only be realized through love for our great country.
President Donald Trump: (08:05)
Because we understand that America is not a land cloaked in darkness. America is the torch that enlightens the entire world. Gathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House, known all over the world as the people’s house, we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our great American story.
President Donald Trump: (08:36)
This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson, who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like President Grant and Eisenhower, who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to chart our continent. In the depths of a bloody Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument and asked God and his Providence to save our nation. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on course to victory in the Second World War.
President Donald Trump: (09:51)
In recent months, our nation and the entire planet has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering lifesaving therapies and will produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner. We will defeat the virus and the pandemic and emerge stronger than ever before.
President Donald Trump: (10:36)
What united generations past was an unshakable confidence in America’s destiny and an unbreakable faith in the American people. They knew that our country is blessed by God and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny, and communism.
President Donald Trump: (11:15)
This towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge and has lifted us to the summit of human endeavor. And yet despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now in danger. This is the most important election in the history of our country.
President Donald Trump: (12:03)
Thank you. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas. This election will decide if we save the American dream or whether we allow a socialist agenda to demolish our cherished destiny. It will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high-paying jobs or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has been foolishly done for many decades. Your vote will decide whether we protect law-abiding Americans or whether we give free rein to violent anarchists, and agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens.
President Donald Trump: (13:02)
And this election will decide whether we will defend the American way of life or whether we will allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it. That won’t happen. At the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic and social injustice. So tonight, I ask you a simple question, how can the Democratic Party ask to lead our country when it spent so much time tearing down our country?
President Donald Trump: (13:57)
In the Left’s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on Earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins. Our opponents say that redemption for you can only come from giving power to them. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history. But in this country, we don’t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we do not turn to government to restore ourselves. We put our faith in almighty God.
President Donald Trump: (14:55)
Joe Biden is not a savior of America’s soul. He is the destroyer of America’s jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of America’s greatness. For 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers, gave them hugs, and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain, and then he flew back to Washington, and voted to ship our jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing their dreams and the dreams of American workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars, wars that never ended.
President Donald Trump: (16:07)
Four years ago, I ran for president because I cannot watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were very far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year, the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments. And this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion a year. And Secretary General Stoltenberg, who heads NATO, was amazed after watching for so many years, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (17:25)
From the moment I left my former life behind, and it was a good life, I have done nothing but fight for you. I did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington politics. I kept my promise. Together we have ended the rule of the failed political class, and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You have seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I very simply said, “America first.” Thank you. Days after taking office, we shocked the Washington establishment and withdrew from the last administration’s job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I then immediately approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, ended the unfair and very costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured, for the first time, American energy independence.
President Donald Trump: (19:27)
We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. Washington insiders asked me not to stand up to China. They pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American people. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest-hitting action against China in American history by far.
President Donald Trump: (20:11)
They said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA, but again they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand-new Mexico-US-Canada agreement into law. And right now, auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees, and not deserting us for other countries.
President Donald Trump: (20:48)
In perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down, and today America’s borders are more secure than ever before. Thank you. We ended catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20000 gang members and 500000 criminal aliens. We have already built 300 miles of border wall, and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations.
President Donald Trump: (22:10)
We are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol Union, representing our country’s courageous border agents. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you. Brave, brave people. You see, this country loves our law enforcement. They do. They really do. Love and respect.
President Donald Trump: (23:00)
When I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the chairman of the board. And now those talented American workers have been rehired, and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand. You went through a lot. Please stand. Thank you. Thank you very much. You’ve been through a lot. Thank you very much.
President Donald Trump: (23:51)
Last month, I took on big pharma. You think that’s easy? It’s not. And signed orders that would massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs, and give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures. We passed the decades-long-awaited right to try. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice, our great veterans, we’re taking care of our veterans. 91% approval rating this month, the VA given by our veterans. First time anything like that has ever happened.
President Donald Trump: (24:40)
By the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court justices.
President Donald Trump: (24:50)
And to bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, and long-term funding of historically Black colleges and universities. And before the China virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded. And I say very modestly that I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. And I have done more in three years for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. And when I am re-elected, the best is yet to come.
Audience: (27:04)
Four more years. Four more years.
President Donald Trump: (27:04)
Thank you very much.
President Donald Trump: (27:11)
When I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel’s true capital, and moved our Embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned, existing building in a better location. Real estate deal, right? And opened it at a cost of less than $500000. Many things like that the government is doing right now. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. Thank you to the UAE. Thank you to Israel. In addition, we obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate, and killed its founder and leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world’s number-one terrorist by far, Qassim Suleimani.
President Donald Trump: (29:43)
Unlike previous administrations, I have kept America out of new wars, and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office, as you know. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States Military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.
President Donald Trump: (30:38)
We have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. Biden’s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted. He supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost one in four manufacturing jobs. We laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states. They did not want to hear Biden’s hollow words of empathy. They wanted their jobs back.
President Donald Trump: (31:40)
As vice president, he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have been a death sentence for the US auto industry. He backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country, and which I’ve reversed and made a great deal for our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted for the Iraq war. He opposed the mission that took out Osama bin Laden. He opposed killing Suleimani, he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as a positive development for America and the world. Some positive development. That is why China supports Joe Biden, and desperately wants him to win. I can tell you that upon very good information.
President Donald Trump: (32:36)
China would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy that they caused all over the world, they caused. In recent months, our nation and the world has been hit by the once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. They could have stopped it, but they allowed it to come out. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders. Please stand and accept our profound thanks and gratitude.
President Donald Trump: (33:34)
Many Americans, including me, I have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives that have been so tragically taken so unnecessary. In their honor, we unite. In their memory, we will overcome it. And when the China virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II, invoking the Defense Production Act. We produce the world’s largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator, which is a miracle. Good job heading the task force by our great vice president. Thank you very much, Mike. Please stand up.
President Donald Trump: (34:50)
We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves, and gowns to our frontline health care workers. To protect our nation’s seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes. We gave everything you can possibly give, and we’re still giving it because we are taking care of our senior citizens. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships. We developed from scratch the largest and most advanced testing system anywhere in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the western hemisphere combined, think of that. We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation, which is India. We developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful antibody treatment known as convalescent plasma. You saw that? On Sunday night when we announced it. That will save thousands and thousands of lives. Thanks to advances, we have pioneered the fatality rates. And you look at it, and you look at the numbers, it has been reduced by 80% since April. 80%.
President Donald Trump: (36:15)
The United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country anywhere in the world. The European Union’s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours, but you don’t hear that. They do not write about that. They don’t want to write about that. They do not want you to know those things. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30% greater increase in excess mortality than the United States. Think of that.
President Donald Trump: (36:44)
We enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. That’s one of the reasons that we’re advancing so rapidly with our economy. Great job. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation. And we are recovering at a much faster rate than anybody. Over the past three months, we have gained over nine million jobs, and that’s a record in the history of our country.
President Donald Trump: (37:29)
Unfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, very early indeed, Joe called it hysterical and xenophobic. And then I introduced a ban on Europe, very early again. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died. Instead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation’s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds. The cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss, and much more. Joe Biden’s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it’s a surrender to the virus.
President Donald Trump: (38:44)
My administration has a very different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts, and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly, while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and to school. And we want to see so many of those great states be opened by Democrats. We want them to be open. They have to be open. They have to get back to work. They have to get back to work, and they have to get back to school.
President Donald Trump: (39:24)
Most importantly, we are marshaling America’s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in record time. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. Nobody thought it could be done this fast. Normally it would be years, and we did it in a matter of a few months. We are producing them in advance so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available. We will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus.
President Donald Trump: (40:07)
At the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that is not because they don’t have one. It is because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an ally of the light. But when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep us completely in the dark. He doesn’t have a clue. He has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which would totally collapse our rapidly improving economy, and once again record stock markets that we have right now, will also collapse. That means your 401(k)s, that means all of the stocks that you have.
President Donald Trump: (40:58)
On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads. I will not raise taxes, I will cut them, and very substantially. And we will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China, back to America. And we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We will make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I’ve already been doing for quite some time if you’ve noticed. Joe Biden’s agenda is made in China. My agenda is made in the USA.
President Donald Trump: (41:46)
Biden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas, laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico, destroying those states, absolutely destroying those states and others. Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. Everybody saw that. Tremendous power outage. Nobody’s seen anything like it, but we saw it last week in California. How can Joe Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can’t even keep the lights on?
President Donald Trump: (42:57)
Joe Biden’s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform. You can’t get away from this, co-authored with far-left senator, crazy Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie manifesto[ calls for suspending all removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide catch-and-release, and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Everybody gets a lawyer. Come over to our country, everybody has a lawyer. We have a lawyer for you. That’s all we need, is more lawyers.
President Donald Trump: (43:35)
Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage, and promised he was going to give it away your health care dollars to illegal immigrants, which is going to bring massive number of immigrants into our country. Massive numbers will pour into our country in order to get all the goodies that they want to give. Education, health care, everything. He also supports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700%. This is in the manifesto. The Biden plan would eliminate America’s borders in the middle of a global pandemic. And he is even talking about taking the wall down. How about that?
President Donald Trump: (44:40)
Biden also vowed to oppose school choice, and close all charter schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children. In a second term, I will expand charter schools, and provide school choice to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect that they deserve. Great people. Great, great people.
President Donald Trump: (45:20)
Joe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies, right up until the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby’s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy. Democrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America’s soul. Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.
President Donald Trump: (46:19)
During the Democrat convention, the words, under God, were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance. Not once, but twice. We will never do that. But the fact is, this is where they’re coming from. Like it or not, this is where they’re coming from. If the Left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other constitutional freedoms. Biden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn’t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, and there are many, there are many. We see them all the time. It is incredible, actually. Then how is he ever going to stand up for you? He’s not.
President Donald Trump: (47:18)
The most dangerous aspect of the Biden platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie manifesto calls for abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400000 criminals onto the streets and into your neighborhoods. When asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, “Yes, absolutely.” When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis Police Department, “A cancer that is rotten to the root,” Biden would not disavow her support and reject her endorsement. He proudly displayed it shortly later on his website, displayed it in big letters.
President Donald Trump: (48:09)
Make no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the Radical Left will defund police departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden’s America. My administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty.
President Donald Trump: (48:58)
One of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American heroes called the NYPD, or New York’s finest, who I was very proud to get their endorsement just the other day. Great people. If they were allowed to do their job, you’d have no crime in New York. Rudy Giuliani knows that better than anybody. Thank you, Rudy. Three years ago on the Fourth of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight, and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge. Detective Familia was a single mom. She recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids.
President Donald Trump: (49:56)
Two years ago, I stood in front of the US Capitol alongside those beautiful children, and held their grandmother’s hand as they mourned their terrible loss. And we honored Detective Familia’s extraordinary life. It was extraordinary. Detective Familia’s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
President Donald Trump: (50:44)
I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever. We must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country, and that’s the overwhelming majority, are noble, courageous, and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs. And by being afraid, they are not able to do the job that they so desperately want to do for you. And those who suffer most are the great people who they protect, and who they want to protect at an even higher level. When there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But when we can never have a situation where things are going on as they are today, we must never allow mob rule. We can never allow mob rule.
President Donald Trump: (52:08)
In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson, and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities all, like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York, and many others, Democrat-run. There is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. Just call, we’re ready to go in. We will take care of your problem in a matter of hours. Just call. We have to wait for the call. It is too bad we have to, but we have to wait for the call. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law. When the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments right outside, I signed an order immediately, 10 years in prison, and it was a miracle. It all stopped. No more statues. They said, “That’s just too long,” as they looked at a statue. “I think we’ll rip it down.” Then they said, “10 years in prison? I think that is too long. Let’s go home.”
President Donald Trump: (53:24)
During their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-run cities. They never even mentioned it during their entire convention. Never once mentioned. Now, they are starting to mention it because their poll numbers are going down like a rock in water. It is too late, Joe. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden’s campaign did not condemn it. They donated to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden’s campaign staff donated to a fund to bailout vandals, arsonists, anarchists, looters, and rioters from jail.
President Donald Trump: (54:17)
Here tonight is the grieving family of retired police captain, David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department, a great man and a highly respected man by all. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters, or as the Democrats would call them, peaceful protesters. They call them peaceful protesters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wonderful wife Ann, and beloved family members, Brian and Kielen. To each of you, we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain. David Dorn. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much. Great man.
President Donald Trump: (55:17)
As long as I am president, we will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace. If the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag burners, that is up to them. But I as your president, will not be part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.
President Donald Trump: (56:04)
Last year, over 1000 African-Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for many decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victim and victims of violent crime in these communities. Joe Biden and the Left ignore these American victims. I never will. If the radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every town, city, and suburb in America. Just imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the US government. Just think of that.
President Donald Trump: (56:58)
Liberal politician’s claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who exactly is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by Radical Left. Always remember, they are coming after me because I am fighting for you. That is what is happening. And it has been going on from before I even got elected. And remember this, they spied on my campaign, and they got caught. Let’s see now what happens.
President Donald Trump: (58:05)
We must reclaim our independence from the Left’s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted, trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words and phrases, and the ever more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of Cancel Culture is to make Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false, and scare you out of saying what you know to be true. Very sad. But on November 3rd, you can send them a very thundering message they will never forget.
President Donald Trump: (59:34)
Joe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing from the scene of the wreckage. The same liberals want to eliminate school choice while they enroll their children into the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in walled off compounds and communities and the best neighborhoods in the world. They want to defund the police while they have armed guards for themselves. This November, we must turn the page forever on this failed political class. The fact is, I am here.
President Donald Trump: (01:00:25)
What is the name of that building? But I’ll say it differently, the fact is, we are here and they are not. To me, one of the most beautiful buildings anywhere in the world is not a building, it is a home, as far as I am concerned. It’s not even a house, it is a home. It’s a wonderful place with an incredible history. But it is all because of you. Together, we will write the next chapter of the great American story. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. We will expand opportunity zones. Thank you, Tim Scott. Bring home our medical supply chains. And we will end our resilience for banned things. We will go right after China. We will not rely on them one bit. We are taking our business out of China. We are bringing it home. We want our business to come home.
President Donald Trump: (01:01:44)
We will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before. We will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months. And it will be higher than that. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities. We will ban deadly sanctuary cities, and ensure federal health care is protected for American citizens, not for illegal aliens.
President Donald Trump: (01:02:21)
We will have strong borders. And I’ve said for years, without borders, we don’t have a country. We don’t have a country. Strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America out of endless and costly foreign wars. We will appoint prosecutors, judges, justices who believe in enforcing the law, not enforcing their own political agenda, which is illegal. We will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. And if we don’t win, your Second Amendment doesn’t have a chance. I can tell you that. I have totally protected it.
President Donald Trump: (01:03:37)
We will protect Medicare and Social Security. We will always and very strongly protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party. Thank you, Kevin. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums. They are coming way down. We will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain the number-one in the world, and keep America energy independent. And for those of you that still drive a car, look how low your gasoline bill is. You haven’t seen that in a long time.
President Donald Trump: (01:04:37)
We will win the race to 5G, and build the world’s best cyber and missile defense, already under construction. We will fully restore patriotic education to our schools and always protect. We will always, always protect free speech on college campuses. And we put a very big penalty in, if they do anything having to do with your free speech, colleges have to pay a tremendous, tremendous financial penalty. And again, it is amazing how open they have been lately.
President Donald Trump: (01:05:25)
We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to plant its beautiful flag on Mars. This is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country together. So tonight, I say to all Americans, this is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties or two individuals in ideology, philosophy, or vision than there is right now.
President Donald Trump: (01:06:10)
Our opponents believe that America is a depraved nation. We want our sons and daughters to know the truth. America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world. Our country wasn’t built by Cancel Culture, speech codes, and crushing conformity. We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American patriots. We are a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers, and trailblazers who refuse to be tied down, held back, or in any way reigned in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on Earth.
President Donald Trump: (01:07:15)
I want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition. Our American ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn’t have money. They didn’t have fame. But they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God. When opportunity beckoned, they picked up their bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into their covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure. Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers. They pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the wild frontier. Legends were born. Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill. Americans built their beautiful homesteads on the open range. Soon, they had churches and communities, then towns, and with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were.
President Donald Trump: (01:09:16)
Americans build their future, we don’t tear down our past. We are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature. And we did it all with style and confidence and flair, because that is who we are.
President Donald Trump: (01:10:06)
Whenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call. From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets, and bayonets to rescue American liberty. They had no fear. But America did not stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a six-million-pound rocket and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the moon. For America, nothing is impossible.
President Donald Trump: (01:10:59)
Over the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights, and we will show that the world for America there is a dream, and it is not beyond your reach. Together, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable. Because together, we are the proud citizens of the United States of America.
President Donald Trump: (01:11:43)
On November 3rd, we will make America safer. We will make America stronger. We will make America prouder. And we will make America greater than ever before. I am very proud to be the nominee of the Republican Party.
President Donald Trump: (01:12:09)
I love you all. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much."
"Aug 23, 2020",11:19 A.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (01:38)
Thank you very much, and it’s good to see you all. Hope you had a great weekend at your convention. We’re going to have a great convention coming up, and I look forward to it.
Donald Trump: (01:51)
But before I discuss a very historic breakthrough in our fight against the China virus, I’d like to provide an update on the recent wildfires in California and the storms in the Gulf of Mexico. Yesterday, I approved a major disaster declaration for California, spoke to Governor Newsom as they battled two of the worst wildfires in the history of their state. That continues.
Donald Trump: (02:19)
The federal government has already deployed over 26,000 first responders and personnel to battle the wildfires. We’re working very closely with the Governor and very closely with a lot of great state representatives and local representatives. We’ll take care of the situation, but we have 26,000 first responders already. Our hearts go out to the thousands of families who have lost their homes, as we grieve for the families of two first responders and five residents who have tragically lost their lives in a very horrific fire, one of the biggest we’ve ever seen.
Donald Trump: (03:01)
My administration is also closely monitoring Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura, which are coming in rapidly. Hurricane Marco is expected to make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow, and Tropical Storm Laura is expected to hit Louisiana two days later. This is somewhat unprecedented, the scope of the storms, and also the fact that they come so quickly after one another. Both storms have the potential of gathering strength before they make landfall and could cause significant damage across the Gulf Coast and also in Puerto Rico. We have everybody stationed and ready to go in Puerto Rico and the Gulf Coast. We have tremendous, tremendous people. FEMA is lined up. We have the Coast Guard ready. The Coast Guard has done a fantastic job. They do such good work, and we want to thank our great Coast Guard.
Donald Trump: (03:58)
I’m asking all Americans in the storm’s path to follow the instructions of your state and local governments very closely. I’ve approved emergency declarations for Puerto Rico and for Louisiana. FEMA is mobilized on the ground and is ready to help. They will be in there very quickly, very, very quickly. I spoke to Governor John Bel Edwards also of Louisiana, and I’ve informed him, and at his request also, a major disaster declaration is signed and ready to go. We have everybody ready in Puerto Rico, the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, and also on the forest fires in California. We have a great team. Unfortunately, we have some very, very powerful natural disasters.
Donald Trump: (04:47)
On the therapeutics front, this is what I’ve been looking to do for a long time. This is a great thing. Today, I’m pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives. The FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization, and a that’s such a powerful term, Emergency Use Authorization, for a treatment known as convalescent plasma. This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection. It’s had an incredible rate of success. Today’s action will dramatically expand access to this treatment.
Donald Trump: (05:39)
I want to thank Dr. Hahn and Secretary Azar. I want to thank the FDA, all of the people that have been working very hard on this. It showed tremendous potential. It’s only made possible because of Operation Warp Speed. That is everybody working together. We’re years ahead of approvals that we would be if we went by the speed levels of past administration. We’d be two years, three years behind where we are today, and that includes on vaccines that you’ll be hearing about very soon, very shortly.
Donald Trump: (06:16)
To deliver treatments and vaccine to save lives, we’re removing unnecessary barriers and delays, not by cutting corners, but by marshaling the full power of the federal government. We provided $48 million to fund the Mayo Clinic study that tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma for patients with the virus. Through this study over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it is proven to reduce mortality by 35%. It’s a tremendous number. The FDA, MIT, Harvard, and Mount Sinai Hospital have also found convalescent plasma to be a very effective method of fighting this horrible disease. Based on the science and the data, the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective.
Donald Trump: (07:12)
Recently, we provided up to $270 million to the American Red Cross and America’s blood centers to support the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma. In late July, we launched a nationwide campaign to ask patients who have recovered, and these are patients that have been incredible the way they’ve donated. But these are people recovered from the virus to donate plasma. Since then, weekly plasma donations have doubled. Today, I once again urge all Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate plasma today, please. It’s been really an incredible … Just incredible people. The country has united so strongly behind this.
Donald Trump: (08:08)
I’ll go over the numbers, but if you look at what’s happened and the success that we’ve had that people don’t talk about, the United States has experienced the lowest case fatality rate of any major country in the world. You don’t hear that. The European Union’s case fatality rate is estimated to be three times higher than that in the United States. Europe has seen 33% more fatalities compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States.
Donald Trump: (08:38)
I just want to ask two of our people that have done such a fantastic job, Alex Azar and Stephen Hahn to say a few words. Stephen, I want to thank you because the FDA really stepped up and especially over the last few days in getting this done. The results have been incredible, and I think you’ll see the results even go up very substantially. So we appreciate it. And maybe I’ll ask Alex to go first, and then Stephen. Thank you very much, Alex.
Alex Azar: (09:06)
Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. Thanks for the bold leadership that allowed us to deliver this very happy news today. Thanks to your all-of-America approach, America has done more than any other country to expand the arsenal that we have to battle COVID-19. Thanks to early efforts by your administration, Americans have broader access to these treatments, including convalescent plasma, than patients anywhere else in the world.
Alex Azar: (09:33)
In early April, early in our fight against COVID-19, the FDA, BARDA, the Mayo Clinic, and other partners sprang into action to set up an expanded access protocol for this promising treatment. President Trump is the right-to-try President, and he’s fought hard to ensure that Americans can have access to promising COVID-19 treatments. Convalescent plasma has been a tried-and-true therapeutic method in prior outbreaks, but the President wanted to ensure that we develop the data to support its use. This FDA authorization is one result of that effort.
Alex Azar: (10:06)
The data we gathered suggests that patients who were treated early in their disease course, within three days of being diagnosed with plasma containing high levels of antibodies, benefited the most from treatment. We saw about a 35% better survival in the patients who benefited most from the treatment, which were patients under 80, who were not on artificial respiration. I just want to emphasize this point because I don’t want you to gloss over this number. We dream in drug development of something like a 35% mortality reduction. This is a major advance in the treatment of patients. This is a major advance.
Alex Azar: (10:51)
Convalescent plasma is one new tool that we’ve added to our arsenal against COVID-19 alongside remdesivir, steroids, and a number of other promising options currently being studied. Because of the President’s Operation Warp Speed, we expect to have other new results and new options reaching patients as soon as this fall. Operation Warp Speed is supporting experimental therapeutics all the way through to manufacturing, so that if they meet FDA’s gold standard for safety and efficacy, they can begin reaching patients without a day wasted.
Alex Azar: (11:24)
Americans who have tested positive for and recovered from COVID-19 can go to coronavirus.gov to find out a quick, convenient way to play a potentially lifesaving role in our fight. Know if you donate plasma, you could save a life. We’ve also provided guidance, so healthcare providers can contact patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and give them information on how they can donate.
Alex Azar: (11:48)
So thank you again, Mr. President for supporting this remarkable progress against COVID-19, and I want to thank Dr. Hahn, Dr. Marks, and the entire team at the FDA for the speed with which they’ve approached this, the diligence to ensure that this meets the standards at FDA. I’ll turn it over to Dr. Hahn, if it’s okay, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (12:07)
[crosstalk 00:12:07] thank you very much. Please, Doctor?
Dr. Hahn: (12:09)
Thank you, Mr. President-
Donald Trump: (12:10)
[crosstalk 00:12:10].
Dr. Hahn: (12:10)
… for your leadership. It’s good to be here today to announce FDA’s recent decision. From the beginning of this pandemic, the President has asked FDA to cut back red tape to try to speed medical products into the hands of providers, patients, and American consumers. I just want to echo the President’s thanks to the more than the 17,000 men and women who work at FDA. They have worked day and night to, in fact, do that.
Dr. Hahn: (12:36)
Plasma is the liquid portion of the blood. That liquid portion contains the natural immunity that someone develops in response to an infection, in this case COVID-19. That liquid portion can be extracted. And for many years, as the President and Secretary Azar said, has been given to patients with infectious diseases for more than a hundred years. So there was a really good rationale for why this might work. In fact, as was mentioned, in early April, an expanded access program was started at the Mayo Clinic with the support of the federal government under President Trump’s leadership. That has gone on for the last four months. More than 90,000, close to 100,000, Americans have enrolled in this program, and over 70,000 have received treatment. This is one of the largest expanded access programs in the history of FDA. So a very successful approach to evaluating how convalescent plasma would work.
Dr. Hahn: (13:34)
In the independent judgment of experts and expert scientists at FDA who have reviewed the totality of data, not just the data from this expanded access program, but more than a dozen published studies, as well as the historical experience associated with this, those scientists have concluded that COVID-19 convalescent plasma is safe and shows promising efficacy, thereby meeting the criteria for an emergency use authorization. In the optimal patients, as described by secretary Azar, treated with convalescent plasma at the highest titers, there was a 35% improvement in survival, which is a significant clinical benefit. Now, we’re waiting for more data. We’re going to continue to gather data, but this clearly meets the criteria that we’ve established for emergency use authorization, and we’re very pleased with these results.
Dr. Hahn: (14:27)
Let me just put this in perspective. Many of you know I was a cancer doctor before I became FDA commissioner, and a 35% improvement in survival is a pretty substantial clinical benefit. What that means is, and if the data continue to pan out, 100 people who are sick with COVID-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma. We’ve seen a great deal of demand for this from doctors around the country. What this emergency use authorization today does, it allows us to continue that and meet the demand.
Dr. Hahn: (15:00)
Again, I want to echo the President’s and the Secretary’s ask of the American people. If you’ve recovered from COVID-19, please donate. It could save a life. Mr. President, thank you again.
Donald Trump: (15:11)
Thank you very much, Stephen. I appreciate it.
Speaker 6: (15:18)
Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (15:19)
Okay, any questions?
Speaker 6: (15:19)
Mr. President? Mr. President?
Speaker 7: (15:19)
Thank you, Mr. President. I want to first ask you about the COVID-19 drugs that are in phase three.
Donald Trump: (15:23)
[crosstalk 00:15:24].
Speaker 7: (15:24)
Are they going to be available to the American population on … You and I talked previously about this idea of right to try.
Donald Trump: (15:32)
Right.
Speaker 7: (15:33)
Can we assure the American people that if it’s being studied and it’s in phase three, you have that right?
Donald Trump: (15:38)
That’s a great question, and I’m not sure a lot of people have been thinking about right to try. We’re all waiting for the final answer. Maybe I could ask Stephen, but I would say that right to try is exactly … If somebody is virtually terminal, in other words they’re not going to make it, and if we have these incredible therapies and drugs that are happening, Alex, I think it’s a very interesting question. I congratulate you for that question because I think we’re-
Speaker 7: (16:05)
Thanks, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (16:05)
… all waiting for that exact final endpoint. What about that, Stephen? We have all of these seemingly great answers that are ready to come out, but because of the process, it takes a little- Can we use some of this early under Right to Try? Please.
Dr. Hahn: (16:18)
So it’s a really good question. Of course, it all depends on the clinical circumstances and what a doctor and a patient together decide with respect to the administration of any agent.
Dr. Hahn: (16:29)
But if you think about what happened with convelescent plasma and the expanded access program, this is exactly what happened. We have ongoing clinical trials that are randomized between placebo or an inactive substance and the convalescent plasma. While that was going on, we knew that there was great demand from patients and doctors. The expanded access program is a way of actually doing that and fits perfectly with what the President just said about allowing people to be able to use something that we have now determined to be very safe.
Donald Trump: (16:57)
I think it was something we have to really consider very strongly.
Dr. Hahn: (17:00)
Yes, sir.
Donald Trump: (17:00)
I think it’s fantastic. You should get credit for that.
Speaker 7: (17:04)
Thanks, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (17:04)
Thank you. That’s very good.
Speaker 8: (17:04)
Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (17:04)
Please, in the back. [OEN 00:17:08]?
Speaker 9: (17:10)
Thank you Mr. President. Convalescent plasma as a treatment has been around for nearly a hundred years. You mentioned Operation Warp Speed, which enabled this process to move along a lot faster. What went into the effort for this to be approved for COVID-19? And was that holdup political in nature?
Donald Trump: (17:30)
Well, I think that there might have been a holdup, but we broke the logjam over the last week, to be honest. I think that there are people in the FDA and actually in your larger department that can see things being held up and wouldn’t mind so much. That’s my opinion, a very strong opinion. And that’s for political reasons. This has nothing to do with politics. This has to do with life or death. So we are being very strong, and we are being very forthright. We have got some incredible answers, and we’re not going to let them be held up because every day is lives, and we’re not going to let that happen. Okay? Very good, thank you.
Speaker 10: (18:06)
Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (18:06)
Please, go ahead.
Speaker 11: (18:10)
Mr. President, in announcing this today, you said that the FDA has made the independent determination that the treatment is safe and very effective. Yet Dr Hahn just said it was showing promising efficacy. Which of the two is correct?
Donald Trump: (18:25)
Well, I think I’ll let Dr. Hahn answer that question.
Dr. Hahn: (18:29)
Under our legal authority for Emergency Use Authorization, this is not the same as an approval, but it’s an authorization, and it allows us to expand the access to this. We know we’re going to continue to collect data. We knew that for all of our Emergency Use Authorizations.
Dr. Hahn: (18:44)
So, for example, remdesivir, which was approved or authorized on May 1st, we’re still collecting data, and we will continue to do that with plasma as well. So it’s the nuances of the language around the authorization that we use and the legal aspect too.
Speaker 11: (18:57)
It’s a promising treatment. You couldn’t say it’s very effective just yet.
Dr. Hahn: (19:02)
If you’re one of those 35 out of 100 people who these data suggest or show survive as a result of it, this is pretty significant for that person and their family.
Donald Trump: (19:12)
Okay, this is a very big day. It’s a day we’ve been looking forward to. Thank you very much. Great questions.
Speaker 12: (19:18)
Was there pressure on you, Dr. Hahn, to authorize this?
Speaker 13: (19:18)
Dr. Hahn?
Speaker 14: (19:18)
Mr. President [crosstalk 00:19:19]
Speaker 12: (19:19)
Dr. Hahn. Could you answer that question? [crosstalk 00:19:19] Dr. Hahn, to authorize this.
Speaker 12: (19:21)

"Aug 19, 2020","15, 2020
5:26 P.M. EDT","Donald Trump: (00:20)
Thank you very much. Before I provide an update on our continued progress against the China virus, I’d like to discuss our latest actions against the Iranian regime.
Donald Trump: (00:36)
Today, I’m directing the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to notify the UN Security Council that the United States intends to restore virtually all of the previously suspended United Nations sanctions on Iran. It’s a snapback. Not uncommon. Two years ago, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, which was a product of the Obama Biden foreign policy failure, a failure like few people have seen in terms of the amount of money we paid for absolutely nothing and a short term deal. This deal funneled tens of billions of dollars to around 150 billion to be exact, plus 1.8 billion in cash, which I don’t know that the president had the authority to give. Gave 1.8 billion in cash. Just another great deal that turned out to be a total disaster that would have funded all of the chaos and the bloodshed and the terror in the region and all throughout the world.
Donald Trump: (01:48)
And I won’t say anything because I don’t like saying it, but Iran doesn’t have so much money to give to the world anymore, to the terrorist, to give to Al Qaeda, various other groups of people that they were funding. They have to keep their own regime together and it’s not easy for them. And if, and when I win the election within the first month, Iran will come to us and they are going to be asking for a deal so quickly because they are doing very poorly, but that deal was a disaster. $150 billion. $1.8 billion in cash and we got nothing except the short term little deal. Short term, expiring and starting to expire already. It’s terminated but it would have, if we didn’t terminate it, start to expire very shortly.
Donald Trump: (02:36)
A good deal was the deal we made with UAE and Israel and by the way, other countries, I will tell you now, want to come into that deal. Countries that you wouldn’t even believe want to come into that deal and all of a sudden, you’re going to have peace in the Middle East and you couldn’t have done it with this ridiculous Iran Nuclear Deal, as they call it, that President Obama made along with sleepy Joe Biden. I imposed the toughest ever sanctions on Iran and this has caused great difficulty for them, giving money to terrorist organizations and if they do, they’ll have hell to pay. Earlier this year, I ordered the strike that took out the world’s number one terrorist Qasem Soleimani. In addition to previously terminating leader and founder of ISIS Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
Donald Trump: (03:35)
The two leading terrorists by far in the world. The founder of ISIS, nobody even talks about that. And we also defeated, we now have 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria. When I took over, it was a mess. It was a total mess. It was, they were all over the place.
Donald Trump: (03:57)
My administration will not allow this Iran nuclear situation to go on. They will never have a nuclear weapon. Iran will never have, mark it down. Mark it down. Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. When the United States entered into the Iran deal, it was clear that the United States would always have the right to restore the UN sanctions that will prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. We paid a fortune for a failed concept and a failed policy, a policy that would have made it impossible to have peace in the Middle East.
Donald Trump: (04:40)
Here at home, through Operation legend, we are confronting the wave of crime in Democrat run American cities, that’s absolutely shocking. When you look at Portland or New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, sometimes Los Angeles, Democrat run cities. They’re a mess because they don’t get it. Either they don’t get it or there’s something that nobody else understands.
Donald Trump: (05:14)
We’ve deployed more than 1,000 additional federal agents to help these Democrat run disasters. We just have done this. We have to give them a hand and we can stop it immediately. Like at Portland, would be so easy to stop. Would stop it immediately. We only sent in some Homeland people who are great, by the way, to save the courthouse, cause it would have been blown up or burned down and they did that very easily. But if we were called upon, we would send in, whether it’s Homeland, whether it’s FBI, whether it’s just law enforcement and we’d send them in quickly. We would eradicate it just like happened in Minneapolis. Soon as they were called in, they should have been called in a lot sooner. You would have had far less damage today.
Donald Trump: (06:06)
Today we announced that Operation legend has successfully resulted in nearly 1,500 arrests already. Bad ones. Bad ones. Really bad people. Prosecutions and prison sentences will follow and there’ll be very long time in prison for what they’ve done to these cities. Most cities are well run. Most of the nation as well run and the areas that we’re talking about are all, they’re all cases run by Democrats, usually radical left leaning Democrats like in New York or in Portland.
Donald Trump: (06:43)
We’ve made arrests in Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Saint Louis, Memphis and Albuquerque for many violent crimes, including gun crimes, arson and 91 murders. We’re also using the full power of the federal government to defeat, as you know, the China virus.
Donald Trump: (07:07)
New cases have declined in 80% of the jurisdictions in the past week; 80%. New Zealand, by the way, had a big outbreak and other countries that were held up to try and make us look not as good as we should look because we have done an incredible job, but they’re having a lot of outbreaks, but they’ll be able to put them out and we put them out. The hospitalization rate has fallen in our country. 54% since its peak in April; 54%. Older Americans are still the most vulnerable to the virus. 92% of deaths have occurred among those 55 and older. Only 2.7% of deaths have occurred among those 44 years. Think of that. 44 years and younger. So 44 years old and younger only 2.7% of…
Donald Trump: (08:02)
… and younger. Only 2.7% of deaths have occurred. And many of those people had preexisting conditions, had problems, heart, diabetes, and other problems, but many of those. So think of that. Only 2.7% under 44 years of age. Excess mortality in Europe this year is 33% higher than the United States. Evidence that the tragic cost of this virus is higher in other Western nations. South Korea. You’ve been reading about South Korea doing well, well, they just had a very big breakout, but they’ll be able to solve the problem. We must all remain vigilant and continue to exercise extreme caution around those at highest risk as we know. Multiple colleges and universities announced that they would suspend in-person teaching. We have learned one thing, there’s nothing like campus. There’s nothing like being with the teacher as opposed to being on a computer board. It’s been proven, a lot better.
Donald Trump: (09:16)
It’s a lot better. The iPads are wonderful, but you’re not going to learn the same way you do by being there. So nevertheless, certain colleges and universities have announced that they would suspend the in-person teaching. For older people and individuals with underlying conditions, the China virus is very dangerous, but for university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal flu. And the seasonal flu happens and comes and it goes, and it can be very bad, but people don’t talk about it in the same way and they shouldn’t. But if you look at that, the odds are less than or equal to. Instead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives. It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans. Makes sense.
Donald Trump: (10:20)
And the shut down thing is causing tremendous depression for those places that are still shut down. You look at certain areas that, in all cases, Democrat run, still shut down. And their numbers there aren’t even good. But causing tremendous depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol, abuse. A lot of problems are being caused. Probably far more, I would say Scott, than is caused by the virus itself now that we understand the virus. Colleges should take reasonable precautions. Students who feel sick should not attend class and should limit social interaction as they would for any other illness. And universities should implement measures to protect the high risk students or professors and teachers. The ultimate goal of testing is to prevent transmission in high risk settings and to prevent transmission, period. But especially in nursing homes and to care for the vulnerable and our elderly, which really fit into that definition of who is vulnerable.
Donald Trump: (11:44)
We have tremendous unused testing capacity in our country. We have a tremendous unused testing capacity. It’s something that a lot of other nations are very impressed with, they tell us. In our path forward, we will continue to follow a science based approach to protecting the high risk while enabling healthy Americans to safely go back to work in school. Our country will be open. Our country is getting opened quickly. Our stock markets are almost back to where they were prior to the China virus disaster coming in. And I want to thank you all for being here and we’ll take some questions. Yes, please.
Speaker 1: (12:28)
During the pandemic, the QAnon movement appears to be gaining a lot of followers. Can you talk about what you think about that and what you have to say to people who are following this movement right now?
Donald Trump: (12:40)
Well, I don’t know much about the movement other than I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate. But I don’t know much about the movement. I have heard that it is gaining in popularity. And from what I’ve hear is these are people that when they watch the streets of Portland, when they watch what happened in New York city in just the last six or seven months, but this was starting even four years ago when I came here. Almost four years, can you believe it? These are people that don’t like seeing what’s going on in places like Portland and places like Chicago and New York and other cities and states.
Donald Trump: (13:21)
And I’ve heard these are people that love our country and they just don’t like seeing it. So I don’t know really anything about it other than they do supposedly like me. And they also would like to see problems in these areas, especially the areas that we’re talking about, go away. Because there’s no reason the Democrats can’t run a city. And if they can’t, we will send in all of the federal, whether it’s troops or law enforcement, whatever, they’d like. We’ll send them in. We’ll straighten out their problem in 24 hours or less.
Speaker 1: (13:57)
The cause of the theory is this belief that you are secretly saving the world from this satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals. Does that sound like something you are behind or-
Donald Trump: (14:12)
Well, I haven’t heard that. But is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing? I mean, if I can help save the world from problems, I’m willing to do it. I’m willing to put myself out there. And we are actually. We’re saving the world from a radical left philosophy that will destroy this country. And when this country is gone, the rest of the world would follow. The rest of the world would follow. That’s the importance of this country. And when you look at some of the things that these people are saying with defund the police and no borders, open borders, everybody just pour right into our country, no testing, no nothing. You talk about testing, no testing. Mexico as you know has a very high rate of infection. The wall is now going to be, next week, 300 miles long.
Donald Trump: (15:09)
Our numbers are extraordinary on the border. And this is through luck, perhaps more than talent, although the talent is getting it built when one party refuses to allow it. And you don’t hear talk about the wall anymore. But I will say this, we need strength in our country not weakness. Too much weakness. Yes. John.
John: (15:30)
Mr. President, you have been very bullish on the promise of convalescent plasma to treat coronavirus. The FDA appeared to be on the brink of issuing an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma. But after hearing from top officials at the NIH that there wasn’t enough evidence to go ahead with that, the FDA has put that on pause. Your reaction to that. And do you believe that convalescent plasma should be in the arsenal of treatments-
Donald Trump: (15:57)
Well, I hear great things about it, John. That’s all I can tell you. And it could be a political decision and-
Donald Trump: (16:02)
I can tell you and it could be a political decision because you have a lot of people over there that don’t want to rush things because they want to do it after November 3rd, and you’ve heard that one before, but I’ve heard fantastic things about Convalescent Plasma, and I’ve heard numbers way over 50 percent success and people are dying and we should have it approved if it’s good and I’m hearing its good. I heard from people at the FDA that it’s good, so we’ll see. I’m going to check that right after this conference.
John: (16:33)
My understanding that the White House will encourage the NIH and the FDA to get this out there as quickly as possible?
Donald Trump: (16:39)
Well if the numbers are as good as I’m hearing. I’m hearing over 50 percent and that’s very good, and we’ve approved certain things that are 31 percent and that’s okay too. That’s not bad, and it’s really had a tremendous impact, but no I have… you’re telling me something right now that surprises me, but we’ll check it out right after this.
John: (17:01)
Are you concerned about a delay?
Donald Trump: (17:03)
I don’t want delays. I don’t want people dying. I don’t want people dying. Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 2: (17:09)
Mr. President, I want to ask you about your tweet earlier today on Goodyear. It was essentially calling for a boycott on Goodyear tires-
Donald Trump: (17:15)
Yeah.
Speaker 2: (17:15)
… do you want the federal government to stop buying and using Goodyear product as well and is there anything-
Donald Trump: (17:20)
Well I’m not happy with Goodyear because what they’re doing is playing politics and the funny thing is the people that work for Goodyear, I can guarantee you, I pole very well with all of those great workers in Goodyear, and when they say that you can’t have Blue Lives Matter, you can’t show a blue line, you can’t wear a MAGA hat, but you can have other things that are Marxist in nature, there’s something wrong with the top of Goodyear. And what the radical left does is they make it impossible for people to do business if they’re Republican or if they’re conservative, they put out all sorts of effort, don’t shop there. They do vicious things. Not so different than what you saw on the streets of Portland two nights ago.
Speaker 2: (18:09)
But what kind of boycott do you envision?
Donald Trump: (18:10)
Oh, I don’t know that’s up to people, but I wouldn’t recommend it. If they want a whole political speech. If they want to let you not do what everybody’s doing. If they want to wear a MAGA hat, or if they want to wear a Blue Life, you know what Blue Lives Matter, right, that’s police men and women. That’s a terrible thing. That’s a terrible thing. They’re using their power over these people. And these people want to wear whatever it is that we’re talking about. You know that. And so I would be very much in favor of people don’t want to buy there, and you know what, they’ll be able to get a good job, because we set a jobs record over the last quarter as you know. The most jobs ever in the history of our country. You’ll be able to get another good job.
Donald Trump: (18:55)
I think it’s disgraceful that they did this. Please go ahead, in the back.
Speaker 3: (19:00)
Yes, Mr. President, you’ve said that the arrest of Jimmy Lai in Hong Kong is “a terrible thing,” do you have a message for Jimmy Lai? Has your administration spoken directly with him? Is your state department working for his release?
Donald Trump: (19:12)
Well I sent him best wishes. I hear he’s a wonderful gentleman, certainly a brave man and I send him best wishes. With that being said, because of that and obviously what happened in Hong Kong, we’ve taken all of the vast amounts of money that we use to subsidize Hong Kong, we essentially subsidize Hong Kong by giving them all sorts of incentives and that’s what made Hong Kong the exchange and business in Hong Kong successful. I’ve taken it all back. That means that the United States is going to do a lot more business.
Donald Trump: (19:48)
We really gave them tremendous incentive and subsidy in order that they be successful for freedom. But now that the freedom obviously seems to have been taken away, we will keep all of the incentives that we were giving them, which is billions, and billions of dollars, and all of that business will come into our country, including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, and it’ll all come here. But I feel badly for him, because I hear he’s a good person. I don’t know him, but I hear he’s a good person, obviously a very brave person.
Donald Trump: (20:24)
Did you have something, go ahead.
Speaker 4: (20:25)
Yes sir. Thank you Mr. President. With the Iraqi Prime Minister coming in tomorrow, what about-
Donald Trump: (20:30)
Say it?
Speaker 4: (20:32)
The Iraqi Prime Minister is coming in tomorrow to meet with you and how do you feel about this notion that Iraq can once again become the buffer between Iranian influence and Russian influence in the Middle East? Do you feel that under this Prime Minister that that’s possible once again? What are your thoughts on it?
Donald Trump: (20:51)
Well this is a man that I get along with very well. We’re largely out of Iraq, we down to very few soldiers I said. We’re getting out of these endless wars, these ridiculous endless wars. We should have never been there in the first place. I think it was the worst decision made in the history of our country. Should have never been there, in the Middle East we should have never been, but we’re getting out rapidly over the course of three years. And getting out, it’s very sticky getting out and some people agree, and many people don’t agree, but I think most people very much agree.
Donald Trump: (21:22)
We’re doing very well in our negotiations with Afghanistan with getting out. We’re down to a much smaller number of people left there and I greet men and women coming home and coming home after they’ve been hit. I’ve also greeted many, many at Dover, greeted many bodies coming back in and we’ve been there 19 years and we’re basically policemen. We’re acting as police as opposed to soldiers and they’re going to have to police their own states and they’ve been doing that for thousands of years. But it’s time after 19 years that our soldiers come home. They’ve done an incredible job, but they’re not allowed to fight to win and maybe they shouldn’t be because a lot of the people, it’s not their fault. But with the Taliban and with going to Iraq again, we’re down in Afghanistan, very low numbers and that’ll be taking place and I let them know, do anything and you’ll be hit like you’ve never been hit before. We’re doing very well. Syria the same thing. Remember when I took all of the soldiers off of the border between Syria and Turkey, right? And everybody said, “Oh, that was two years ago. That was a long time ago.” They said, “Oh, this is terrible, terrible, terrible.” We’re going to leave. Why do we have our soldiers between Syria and Turkey? Turkey can definitely take care of itself. I have a very good relationship with President Erdogan and Syria’s been fighting forever. And I say, “Why are we guarding their border?” And I brought our soldiers back home. I got them out, and guess what? Nothing’s happened. They’ve been fighting like they have been for a thousand years okay? Nothing’s happened. And nobody mentions that. Everybody said, “This is going to be a disaster.” There’s no disaster, nothing’s happened.
Donald Trump: (23:18)
We’re getting out of the endless wars and we are building a military the likes of which the world has never seen. Two and a half trillion dollars we’ve spent. And we hopefully don’t ever have to use it. But we want to focus on a much bigger picture, because we have a much bigger picture. It’s when you look at what China’s doing, when you look at what Russia’s doing, when you look at what some other countries are doing. We want to be ready just in case there is a catastrophe. We don’t want to see that. We don’t want to ever use it. We’ve rebuilt our military. New missiles, new rockets, and new tanks, and new everything. Two and a half trillion… all made in the USA and we’ve upgraded in-
Donald Trump: (24:03)
Made in the USA and we’ve upgraded incredibly our nuclear capability and some of our nuclear needed nourishment, it needed new strength, and we’ve upgraded it very, very significantly. I mean to a level that nobody would even believe and hopefully we don’t, you pray to God, we never have to use it, okay? But we’ve never been in a position where we’ve been this strong, please.
Speaker 5: (24:31)
Mr. President, thank you so much. I wanted to ask you about the Middle East. I have a couple of questions. You mentioned that other countries are interested in following suit.
Donald Trump: (24:36)
Yes. Having to do with UAE and Israel.
Speaker 5: (24:39)
Exactly. So, do you expect that Saudi Arabia will join and-
Donald Trump: (24:44)
I do.
Speaker 5: (24:45)
Yes. And also the Emeratis have expressed interest in the F35. Do you think that that should be something that they could look forward to in the future? Is there some sort of timeline?
Donald Trump: (24:57)
I think, look, they’ve definitely got the money to pay for it. It’s nice because usually what we, a lot of times we make deals they don’t have 25 cents, these countries we deal with. We give it to them like, “How about paying us back later?” But they never pay because they don’t have the money. Now they have the money and they would like to order quite a few F35s. It’s the greatest fighter jet in the world, as you know, by stealth, totally stealth. You can’t see. It makes it very difficult. I was asking a pilot, “What do you think is better? This one, this one, that one,” talking about Russian planes, Chinese planes.
Donald Trump: (25:31)
He said, “Well, the advantage we have is you can’t see it, so when we’re fighting, they can’t see us.” I say, “That sounds like a really big advantage to me,” to these guys.
Donald Trump: (25:43)
You know, they look, by the way, I said to these pilots that I meet, they look better than Tom Cruise, and they’re definitely tougher. He’s a nice guy, but these people are amazing and I speak to him a lot about it. What do you think, as I go around to the various places, I saved the big one in Florida as an example. That was a big one, knocked down pretty much by the hurricane. So, I spent a lot of time on that. And it’s the greatest plane in the world.
Donald Trump: (26:15)
One thing about that kind of thing, technology, high technology, greatest plane doesn’t last long if somebody comes up with something else, but we’re always the one to come up with something else. So yeah, they’d like to buy F35s, we’ll see what happens. It’s under review, but they made a great advance in peace in the Middle East, even the New York Times thought it was an incredible deal. Can you imagine that. Tom Friedman had a very nice thing to say about it. I spoke to him about it. He thought it was terrific and it is terrific.
Donald Trump: (26:46)
I see a lot of countries coming in fairly quickly and when you have them all in, ultimately Iran will come in too, there’ll be peace in the Middle East. That’ll be a nice. Iran will be very much neutralized. They never thought this could have happened. With the horrendously stupid Iran deal signed by Obama, this could have never happened.
Speaker 6: (27:15)
On the Goodyear issue, you ride on Goodyear tires in the presidential limousine.
Donald Trump: (27:19)
Yep. You’re right.
Speaker 6: (27:20)
If there were an alternative, would you want those tires swapped out?
Donald Trump: (27:23)
Yeah, I would do that. I would swap them out based on what I heard. We’ll see what happens. Look, you’re going to have a lot of people not wanting to buy that product anymore and they’ll buy from a competitor made in the USA too, okay? Please.
Speaker 4: (27:37)
Mr. President, excerpts from Obama’s speech that he’ll give later at the Democratic Convention show that he says that he hoped that you would take the being president more seriously once you had the job and discover reverence for democracy. And then he said, I quote, “But he never did.” What is your reaction to that?
Donald Trump: (27:55)
When I listened to that, and then I see the horror that he’s left us, the stupidity of the transactions that he made, look what we’re doing. We have our great border wall, we have security, we have the UAE deal, which has been universally praised. Praised by people that aren’t exactly fans of Donald Trump for various reasons. I don’t know why, can’t be my personality, but they’re not fans. When I look at what we have. Now, look at how bad he was, how ineffective a president he was. He was so ineffective, so terrible, slowest growing recovery in the history, I guess since 1929, on the economy. Don’t forget until the China virus came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. I’m going to have to do it a second time, we’re doing it again. Hard to believe we’re doing very well. You heard the numbers they’re way, way down on the virus. But when you look at the kind of numbers that we’re producing on the stock markets, we’re almost at the level, in fact, NASDAQ and S&P are higher than they were at the highest point prior to the China virus coming and the plague coming in.
Donald Trump: (29:14)
Now, president Obama did not do a good job and the reason I’m here is because of President Obama and Joe Biden, because if they did a good job, I wouldn’t be here and probably if they did a good job, I wouldn’t have even run. I would have been very happy. I enjoyed my previous life very much, but they did such a bad job that I stand before you as president. Thank you all very much."
"Aug 17, 2020",5:27 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (01:33)
Well hello Oshkosh. Wow! I don’t know what happened. Something happened. This was supposed to be just a quick little small gathering. This is what’s happening and we call it a peaceful protest. We’re supposed to have 50 people, right? So we have a little more and they turned away a lot of people outside. So we’ll call it a peaceful protest. That way we could do whatever we want.
Donald Trump: (02:03)
You know that’s what they call it in New York and these different places Portland, when they’re rioting all over the streets they say it was a peaceful protest. So you can have thousands of people doing it we’ll do the same thing. I’m truly thrilled to be here with you. The hardworking patriots of Wisconsin. Thank you. Thank you. It’s a big group of people. This is like a rally I said it’s not supposed to be a rally. We’re not supposed to have a rally. I hereby grant to you a pardon. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (02:53)
Well, I want to thank you. Thank you. In the months ahead we will need every ounce of your strength and drive and patriotism. We’re in a fight for the survival of our nation and civilization itself. We are really in a fight. This is the most important election we’ve ever had in my opinion. And I used to say it and I’d say it with great conviction, 2016 but you know what? That wasn’t crazy people we were dealing. They were on the edge, crooked Hillary was on the edge. She was on the verge. She became crazy later on when she lost. That’s what she became. But these are people that are seriously radical left. Joe Biden is nothing but their puppet. He has no clue what’s happening.
Donald Trump: (03:42)
And then baking speeches that are taped, who wants to listen to Michelle Obama do a tape speech? No, you got to have her get up there. But we’re doing a real speech on Thursday next Thursday, she’ll be listening. Doing it live from the white house, live from the white house. So we have plenty to say. So Joe Biden and the Democrats have pledged to oppose $4 trillion of new taxes. So this is a group of people that think it’s good to raise everybody’s taxes. In the old days a politician would lower taxes, right? The great Scott Walker is here, your governor. Scott would lower taxes, but now the whole thing I guess it’s changed. It’s gotten inside out. Now everybody says we’re going to raise your taxes, but Republicans are lowering your taxes. We gave you the biggest tax decrease of the history of our country and we’re going lower.
Donald Trump: (04:45)
But they’re going to massively increase your regulations. In addition to your taxes, they’re going to confiscate the guns of law abiding Americans. They’re going to take away your second amendment. They’re going to make America a sanctuary for criminal aliens. They’re going to keep those sanctuary cities. They love sanctuary cities. They’re going to protect the criminals, abolish American energy and make us reliant on foreign nations and force taxpayers to fund extreme late term abortion. That’s what they’re doing. They also want to abolish the suburbs by allowing far left Washington bureaucrats to force the construction of low income housing projects in every neighborhood in America. That’s what they want to do, that’s their goal. And we’re going to let you preserve your American dream in the suburbs. Okay? We ended the program. We ended the program. The voters of Wisconsin are very, very spectacular people. We are going to take care of you at every level. We are going to fight for you. We are going to fight for every single aspect that you have going. We are never going to forget you. You didn’t forget me in the last election so I want to thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. I want to thank you very much. It’s great. So we issued a regulation and we ended that regulation because when we talk about suburbs and we talk about other things we have taken care of about 84% of Obama regulations, executive orders. It’s amazing. We knocked out a big portion of what he did, including the wonderful mandate, right? The individual mandated Obamacare, which totally by the way, by far the worst of all of Obamacare. We took it out, essentially that ended Obamacare. And then you say so we knocked out 84% of what he did and then they say he was a wonderful president. Why was he a wonderful president if we knocked out in a very popular way knocked out 84%? The voters of Wisconsin face a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the radical left mob or do you want to stand tall as free men and women in the greatest country on earth and keep it that way?
Donald Trump: (07:18)
Do you want to crush our economy under the crazy socialist policies of sleepy Joe Biden and his boss Kamala Harris? And his other boss Nancy Pelosi, she’s a beauty. And his ruler Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. Or do you want to quickly rebuild the strongest economy in the history of the world? Which we did. We’re going to have to do it again. We’re going to have to do it again and we’re in the process of doing it.
Donald Trump: (07:59)
We’ve built the greatest economy on earth and now we’re doing it again. You look at all the numbers, we’re going to go over them. Do you want to fund and defame and dismantle the police? I don’t think so. Do you want to support the incredible heroes of law enforcement? Yes, right? Do you want your friends and family to be persecuted by the far left wing? It’s called cancel culture, right? Cancel culture. Or do you want to defend our history, our heroes, our faith, our values and our treasured American way of life, which is what we have?
Donald Trump: (08:44)
Now don’t believe the lies you’re going to hear on tape. Most of it is going to be tape. I wonder is Joe Biden taping his speech too because if he is, I think I’ll tape mine. How do you watch a tape? They talk about a convention. How do you watch a tape speech? I would imagine Joe is going to do everything he can to tape it. I saw them asking him questions today. It was a news conference and he read them off a teleprompter. I don’t get it. I don’t get it. Something going on up there. We can’t afford it. I can tell you this look, from doing this now we’ve built the greatest economy in the world, we rebuilt our military, we gave you the greatest tax cuts in history, we gave you the greatest regulation cuts. We became energy independent. We’ve done things that nobody thought possible, right? Nobody thought possible. We’ve done things that nobody ever thought you had the greatest year in the history of your state last year, greatest year. And when you look at the numbers, you’re going to have an even greater year next year, unless somebody comes in and quadruples your taxes. In which case it’s called the depression folks. It’s called it depression. It’s not going to happen because we’re going to win. Biden is just a Trojan horse for socialism. He’s a Trojan horse. He has no clue, but the people around him are tough and they’re smart. But we disagree with them very, very strongly. They’re mean and they’re angry like her. By the way, nobody treated Joe Biden worse than Kamala, right? She was worse than Pocahontas, She was worse than anybody on stage. Nobody treated him worse or with less respect. She had no respect. All of a sudden she’s now saying he’s the wonderful. She didn’t feel that way a little while ago. Let’s talk about her for a second. She left in shame. She started at 14 she left at two. She went in the wrong direction. So if a poll is any indication, that’s what we want, speak in the polls. Fake news, CNN. They probably have their cameras going thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (10:57)
No, no, no. Frankly, their pollster’s much better than Fox because Fox has never gotten it right. Fox pollster I don’t know who he is, but he hasn’t had a clue for about seven years. Let me just tell you that CNN gave us an increase of 10 or 11 points in just a short period of time that we went up and now they call it margin of error. Don’t believe it. We’re way beyond the margin of error don’t believe it.
Donald Trump: (11:26)
I just got back from Texas and Florida and Ohio. We were all over the place. We went to great states and every roadway and highway, we had thousands, tens of thousands. I would say at least on each one a hundred thousand people from the plane, because that’s why this isn’t a rally. This is again, friendly protest. We were not allowed to do rallies, right? Because of rules and regulations which we want to adhere to. But from the plane to an oil well, from the plane to getting law enforcement, all of the sheriffs in Florida gave us their full endorsement
Donald Trump: (12:14)
And in Ohio we went to a plant Whirlpool. They were out of business, they were going out of business and now they’re a thriving company because they were dumping washing machines and dryers into our country and I stopped it. And I said, “You want to do that? We’re putting a massive tariff.” And all of a sudden Whirlpool and thousands of people that work in Ohio and other places it became a really terrific company again. And we went there. But if you look at the kind of enthusiasm we have, we have never had the enthusiasm that we have right now and that includes 2016.
Donald Trump: (12:56)
And I hate to say it and I don’t want to be rude because I would never be rude. But let me just tell you Joe Biden has no enthusiasm. No enthusiasm and you don’t win without enthusiasm. People aren’t saying we got to get him in. The only reason they want him in is they want to stop our great agenda. That’s the only reason, that’s the only thing he has going. And nobody wins when you’re not on the side of enthusiasm. So we have more than we ever had in 2016. And in 2016 nobody has ever seen a campaign with that kind of enthusiasm. And we have much more now.
Donald Trump: (13:39)
But the socialists will not stop until they’ve ransacked America and laid waste to our cities. Your eyes don’t lie look at Portland. It’s been turned into a war zone and we want to go in and solve it. We saved the courthouse, do you believe it? We had to send in Homeland security. They were great. They easily saved it after it was pounded. Portland was supposed to be watching it, but they weren’t. So we sent them in and we will send in the national guard just like we did in Minnesota. You saw what happened there, Minneapolis. The national guard went in within 15 minutes the whole thing was over. They should have called them in a week earlier.
Donald Trump: (14:25)
My beautiful, beautiful fifth Avenue in New York has been looted in pillage. It was allowed to happen by an incompetent mayor that doesn’t have a clue. Look at what’s happened to our diamond. New York was a diamond for the country. Look how far it’s gone down. And Chicago, the mayor literally raised up the drawbridges to prevent hordes of rioters from ransacking the city. Can you believe it? Can you believe it? 17 officers were injured in Chicago. They had a week. A little while ago during a weekend spree where 78 people were shot-
Donald Trump: (15:03)
During a weekend spree where 78 people were shot and 18 died. That’s worse than Afghanistan, which we’re getting out of. That’s worse than Iraq, which we’re almost out of. That’s worse than Syria, which we’re out of, except we kept the oil, but that’s okay. We don’t have to talk about that. But this is the future that Joe Biden plans to bring to every city, town, and suburb in our nation. And you know, for those suburbs, I keep hearing about suburban women. I made the … Oh. Well, in one speech recently, I called you suburban housewives and they all loved it, but what I got, they said, “Sir, I don’t know if that’s politically correct.” I said, “Don’t worry about it. They’ll get over it.” Right? But we saved the suburbs. The suburbs, and you know what I’m talking about. And they said about the rule, it’s a rule. Very strong. It’s like a law. They said, “Sir, we can amend it.” I said, “No, I don’t want it amended.” “No, we can really amend it. Bring it down.” “No, I don’t want it. I want it terminated.” And we terminated it. It’s gone. And it’ll be re-instituted if Joe Biden comes in.
Donald Trump: (16:22)
Not by him, because he has no idea what the law says or what it means, but by the people that will be running our country. It will not be him. It will not be him running our country. They will turn every city into a Portland and they wouldn’t mind. No one will be safe in a Biden run America. But while I’m president, the United States will use every tool and we’ve done it. By the way, our country is doing great. We have the pandemic should have never been allowed to happen by China. Should’ve never been allowed to happen.
Donald Trump: (16:58)
They released it. They didn’t release it in China, but it came to the United States and Europe. 188 all over the world. 188 countries all over the world. We’re not going to forget it. We’re not going to forget it, but we’re doing great coming back. We’re coming back and our numbers are better than almost all countries. I will tell you that. Despite what you hear. Look at all of them up there. Scott, look at all of that fake news. It’s unbelievable.
Donald Trump: (17:24)
Unfortunately, Fox has become fake news too. I don’t know what happens to these people, right? Do you agree? At least the other side, you know where they’re coming from. But I’ll use every tool at my disposal to arrest those violators of federal law and put them behind bars. And that’s what we’re doing. When they were ripping down the statues, our great statues, they were ripping them down. I passed and signed something that’s beautiful. It says 10 years in prison if you knock down a statue. Amazing.
Donald Trump: (17:56)
What happened? What happened, Scott? I don’t see it anymore. Now they go up and they look at his statue and they say, “I don’t know. 10 years is a long time.” They say, “Let’s get out of here.” But did you notice that three months ago, I signed it. They will get to have thousands of people march on Washington to rip down statues. And these people are sick. They’re anarchists. They were going to knock down Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln. He was fair game. Abraham Lincoln. So I said, “These people are sick. They are troubled individuals. They’re anarchists and agitators. They’re not just protestors.” They call them peaceful protestors. You’re peaceful protestors on the record. You’re peaceful protestors.
Donald Trump: (18:43)
And by the way, you’re a lot … Look at this guy over here. Look at the size of that guy. You’re a lot tougher than they are. Just so you understand that, right? Look at the size of that guy. But Biden and Harris are pro-crime and anti- cop. There’s no other way to say it. And we’re anti-crime, we are pro-cop all the way. I’ve gotten the endorsement. I got the endorsement. Pat Lynch, New York City police. They gave us an endorsement first time, I think. He said I think it’s the first time they’ve ever done it. That means it’s been a long time. They don’t do that kind of thing. They endorsed me. All the sheriffs in Florida endorsed me.
Donald Trump: (19:29)
What you have all of the law enforcement in Texas endorsed me. We’re getting endorsement from … We haven’t found anybody that won’t endorse in law enforcement. We haven’t found anybody, and if we do, I think they’d probably be in big trouble. I really do. I think they’d be in big trouble because nobody could figure it out. We are getting the endorsement of law and these are great people. These are great Americans. These are people that want our people to be safe. So, we’re thrilled today to be joined by county sheriffs from across the state, and I am deeply honored to receive the endorsement of more than three dozen Wisconsin sheriffs. Where are you? Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Thank you, fellas. They’re good looking people. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I like that mask. MAGA. I wonder if he supports Trump? He’s got MAGA this big. I wonder if he’s a Trump … Hey, thank you, sheriffs. We appreciate it. Good looking guys. Good looking guys.
Donald Trump: (20:46)
And I’ll never let you down, sheriffs. I’ll never let you down. You know that. We gave you all of the surplus equipment. We had millions and millions of dollars of surplus equipment and Obama and Biden didn’t want to give it. They didn’t want to give it. They thought it looked too militaristic, meaning it was … A lot of it was really defensive equipment so that we can keep our law enforcement safe. And I distributed it. All of hundreds of millions of dollars. It was sitting there drawing dust and warehouses that we were probably paying a fortune for all over the country, and you got it. We all got it. Everybody got it. And everybody’s happy.
Donald Trump: (21:27)
As president and as your president, I will always stand with law enforcement, and that’s something that I can’t even imagine anybody saying anything differently, but this other side does. They say it differently. I mean, nobody can even understand it. This November, the voters of Wisconsin will not surrender their beloved state to the left wing mob, and that’s what would happen. In 78 days, we’re going to stop the radical left. We’re going to win the state of Wisconsin and we are going to win four more years.
Speaker 1: (22:20)
Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.
Donald Trump: (22:20)
And then after that, we’ll go for another four years because you know what? They spied on my campaign. We should get a redo of four years. We caught them spying on the … Can you believe it? Did you see the FBI agent? He agreed. He’s pleading that he forged documents. Oh, that’s that’s good. No no. Wait until you see. It’s going to be incredible, but they spied on my campaign. They spied on our campaign. Nobody has ever seen anything like it. You can call it whatever you want. I use the word treason. They got caught. They got caught. The same people doing speeches on tape tonight. They got caught. So it’s too bad.
Donald Trump: (23:06)
So, we have some great friends with us tonight. I want to thank representative Glenn Grothman. Glenn, thank you very much. And Jim Sensenbrenner is around here someplace. Thank you, Jim. Thanks, Jim. These guys are warriors. Also, a woman who did so great, she was so great in Michigan. She headed up Michigan. And a Republican hadn’t won Michigan in many, many years. And we got a lot of car companies building right now in Michigan. Don’t we? Ronna McDaniel, Ronna McDaniel. We won Michigan. I said, “Get me the woman that kept calling me in Michigan. You have to come one more time, sir.” I said, “This is it.” Then I’d leave and she’d call the next day. “One more time.” But you know, she did a great job. Thank you very much. Ronna’s fantastic. Head of the RNC.
Donald Trump: (24:04)
And the head of the Wisconsin Republican party, Chairman Andrew Hit. Andrew, wait, how are we doing, Andrew? Looking good. Beautiful kids, Andrew. Good. Good. I’m going to blame you, Andrew, if they don’t do it. Okay. I’ll fire you so fast Andrew. Andrew’s done a great job. Thank you. I think we are looking great here. We won it last time and you remember what a big shockwave because the Republican hadn’t won it for a long time and they were waiting for Pennsylvania and we won Pennsylvania and we had lost every vote. We would have won, but they didn’t want to call it. It got later and later and later, then Wisconsin came in and then Michigan came in and then Pennsylvania came in. By that time, we already had North Carolina. It’s hard for Republicans. You have to run the whole board, because they started off that we’re going to play for New York. With all of the crime in New York, I got to play for New York, because we did well in New York. We did well in New York, but we’re going to play for New York.
Donald Trump: (25:10)
We’re going to play, I don’t know, guess we’ll do a little bit of a tiny shot maybe in California. They like me. And we’ll do a tiny little shot in Illinois. The other one we’re going to do, we’re going to go after New Jersey, we’re going to go after Virginia. We have a crazy governor of Virginia. He doesn’t want you to have guns and he doesn’t mind not only abortion, he doesn’t mind execution, because after birth, we’ll decide what to do with the baby, right? No, no. After. You hear this guy? First time I had heard of it. Scott, after birth, we will decide and we will discuss with the mother. And that’s the first time I’ve heard of it. This is the guy that likes to pretend he’s Michael Jackson, right? With the dancing. His wife saved a great embarrassment.
Donald Trump: (25:54)
We have another great friend of mine. A great, great politician, but really, he’s much more than a politician. He’s an exceptional human being. He is tough. I had to go against him of those presidential primaries and I want to tell you, there’s nobody tougher, but he basically loves this state. I mean, he loves this state and he should be your governor right now. He should be. He’s an exceptional man. Scott Walker, governor Scott Walker. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (26:37)
I’ll tell you one thing. He’s one of the most respected men. He goes into Washington, everybody stands up. They really do respect him a lot. And it’s really something. The next time you run, please don’t put marijuana on the ballot at the same time you’re running. You brought out like a million people that nobody ever knew were coming out, right? Because there was no way, but you can do whatever you want. You know that. You’re going to be successful, whatever you want to do. Thank you very much God for being here.
Donald Trump: (27:06)
So, before the virus came in from China, unemployment in Wisconsin had reached the lowest rate ever recorded. Ever recorded. That was part of Scott’s thing too. I have to give him a little credit there, right? I have to do that. But we created 15,000 Wisconsin manufacturing jobs. Everybody said that would be impossible. 121, 000 Wisconsinites were lifted out of poverty and 100,000 were lifted off of food stamps because they had good jobs.
Donald Trump: (27:42)
And we had created the single greatest economy in the history of the world. Our national economy was better than any economy that had ever happened before it. And China was having the worst year they had in 67 years. Not that I want that, but we took in billions of dollars. Nobody ever judged China for doing anything. What the money they took out of our country for so many years and the presidents that preceded me should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it to happen. And that includes sleepy Joe is part of that too.
Donald Trump: (28:19)
But then we were hit by the virus and I had to close it up. I took the greatest economy and I closed it up and we saved millions of lives, as many lives. It shouldn’t have been one, but what you see today, you could multiply it times 10 or 15 or maybe even 20. It would have been a horrible … It would not have been sustainable, and now we’re bringing it back and we’ll bring it back so strongly. I took unprecedented action to save the U.S. economy and support Wisconsin families. Under our Paycheck Protection Program, we helped save over 1 million Wisconsin jobs. Earlier this month, I issued a directive granting emergency payroll tax relief to every worker making under $100,000 per year.
Donald Trump: (29:11)
And this temporary relief will help tens of millions of American workers. That is something that people really … I’ll tell you, the great economists, that’s what they wanted. The payroll tax cut more than any other thing and it really applies. Number one, they open their business. It’s great for them, but really great for you, and it’s a big saving. It’s a lot of money in your pocket. If Republicans win in November, we will forgive these payments in full.
Donald Trump: (29:42)
Thanks to my administration’s policies, we’re now witnessing the fastest … And you’ve seen this, right? The fastest economic recovery in the history of our country. Over the past three months, we have already gained much more than nine million jobs nationwide. That’s a record. That’s not even close by the way.
Donald Trump: (30:03)
Nationwide, that’s a record. That’s not even close by the way. And you heard about the V, the V, the famous V and they said, “Well, maybe not a V. It’s got to be an M. It’s got to be an S. It’s got to be,” they have no clue. It’s turned out to be a super V because the numbers are much better. When you see the numbers coming, retail spending has fully recovered and is now at an all time high. And auto production has surged 28%. And in leaving the great plane right behind me and we have a lot of televisions, we have televisions in closets. I was saying to another group, we have televisions on floors and ceilings. You can’t escape it. If you want to get away from Trump, you can’t be in that plane because … the fake news and Trump, they’re going to go out of business. When I do leave, in let’s say 16, 20 years, something like that. No, when we leave, they’re all out of business. I wouldn’t say that sleepy Joe would be very exciting to cover. I don’t think a lot of, “Let’s turn on the television, let’s watch what Biden’s saying today darling.”
Donald Trump: (31:15)
But I just noticed on television that NASDAQ, that’s a big deal. NASDAQ hit an all time record today. The highest price ever, and the others are right behind it. I mean, who would think, we have a pandemic. I think we’re way on the other side of the pandemic, we’re doing great with vaccines and therapeutics and everything else, but regardless, we’re doing great with it, but who would think that we hit a record with NASDAQ and the others are right there. If you would have said we’re at 28,000 on the Dow, or just about and if you would have said NASDAQ hit a new record high, that’s great for your 401k’s.
Donald Trump: (31:53)
Look, you get the wrong person in here, your 401k’s, wave goodbye to them. There’ll be worthless. There’ll be worthless. 401ks, that’s one of the things. A lot of people are bragging. About four months ago, they were very depressed. I said, “Don’t sell, don’t sell. Don’t worry about, don’t sell, forget about this.” And most people held and they’re very, very good. But husbands come up to me and wives come up to me. And one wife was saying, “Sir, I always thought my husband was a financial loser, a total loser.” He was this big good-looking policemen actually. And she said, “He’s never been good with money, but over the years, over the last few years, I think he was up 89%.” I said, “That’s not as good as most people.” She said, “No, no. My husband is a financial genius.” And this good looking policeman looked at me and said, “Thank you, sir, because I was abused for a long time about the way I invested money.”
Donald Trump: (32:53)
And your 401ks are great. And your stocks are great. Then you see these big companies going up, that’s everybody, the stock market. That’s everybody. That’s just an indication. And they’re smart people. They know where it’s going. They have an instinct that’s better than most people. And they see what’s happening. Now with all of that, we have a headwind and the headwind is if for any reason we didn’t win, that stock market is going to go down like a rock goes through water. I hate to tell you folks, so good looking. If we didn’t have that headwind, your stocks would be even higher right now, even higher. So on election night, expect your 401k’s and your stocks to go very, very high. And I do believe we’re going to have a tremendous success. I do believe.
Donald Trump: (33:45)
Again, the most enthusiasm that anybody has ever seen in any election is this one. The most enthusiasm. So we got to get out and vote. You got to be careful with your ballots. Be careful, your absentee ballots great. Your others, you got to be very careful or go to vote. Just go to vote. Go to vote. We have a little problem here. You have a Democrat governor who is will do anything to turn things around. How’s Tom Tiffany doing, by the way? Another win, we just had a nice win, right? Tom is around here someplace. Tom Tiffany just had a great win. We’re winning a lot. We’ve won a lot of House seats. We’re going to definitely, we’re going to take back the House. We’re going to take back the House.
Donald Trump: (34:36)
As part of our great rebuilding the U.S. military we also signed a $5.5 billion contract to build combat ships in Marinette, Wisconsin, supporting thousands of jobs. We’ve totally rebuilt our military. We’ve spent $2.5 trillion, all made in the USA, all made in the USA. We have new fighter jets. We have new rockets. We’ve upgraded our nuclear, hope to God we never have to use it, but nobody’s even close. It was getting very tired. What we’ve done with our military is incredible with tanks. Speaking of tanks, we left our great tank, I was supposed to close down, we have a tank factory in Lima. Lima, Ohio, and it was scheduled to close. And I went to see it. And I said, “No way, we’re closing it because there’s no way we could ever reproduce that incredible,” and you know what happened? We didn’t close it. And we are buildings tanks like you wouldn’t believe. But what we’ve done with our military has been incredible.
Donald Trump: (36:02)
And Biden has promised to slash our defense budget, destroying critical jobs. But more importantly, if we don’t have defense, everything we talk about is meaningless. We have to have defense. Defense of our country, especially when you look at what’s happening outside of our borders. So we have the greatest, right now when I took it over was totally depleted. It was gone. Right now, we have the greatest military we’ve ever had, the greatest equipment by far we’ve ever had. If Kamala and Biden are ever elected, this recovery will come to a total shutdown to use their word permanently. For no scientific reason. Biden wants to inflict dramatic harm on millions of Americans with his basement strategy, locking everyone in their homes.
Donald Trump: (36:56)
You look at what’s happening with some of… And you got a dose of it right here, I hate to say, with some of these Democrat governors, they just don’t want to open it up. By the way, on November 4th, they’ll announce, “Well, we’ve decided to open.” November four. You got to get out to those polls. I’m serious. This is the most dangerous election we’ve ever had. The most dangerous, because I don’t think we can ever bring it back if they get in. I don’t think there’s anything called the comeback. It’ll be another Venezuela. I used to say that lightly. I now say it very strongly because it’s a similar ideology. This will be a large scale, very large scale, Venezuela if they win.
Donald Trump: (37:41)
We’re going to win. My administration by contrast is following the science, applying common sense, mitigation, sheltering, you know this, we got a shelter. We got to take care. But what do we really have to do? We have to take care of our elderly people, our elderly people with heart problems, with diabetes, and we’re launching Operation Warp Speed to deliver effective treatments and ultimately a vaccine and therapeutics. More than 270 therapies are in clinical trials. Can you believe it? 270. And you’re going to be hearing some very good news very, very soon.
Donald Trump: (38:19)
Now, we’re dealing with the deep state. So I’m watching it very closely. I don’t need to have them announce on November 4th, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve found the vaccine, it’s perfect.” I don’t need that. And hopefully everyone’s looking to do the right thing. We want to get it out quickly, but we’re very close, both on therapy and on therapeutics and on vaccines. Advances in treatment have reduced the fatality rate in adults by 85% since April. Think of that. Three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials and we’re mass producing doses already of that vaccine because we think it works and we’re going to have it out very quickly. We will defeat the China virus. We will have the greatest economy that we’ve ever had next year, unless somebody wants to quadruple your taxes and the crazy things that they’re talking about, we will have next year, the single greatest economy we’ve ever had. So Biden’s been there for 47 years and he’s personally supported every globalist sellout of the last half century. He voted for NAFTA. One of the worst trade deals in history. For the China entry into the World Trade Organization, a total catastrophe. For Korea, the Korean deal was horrible. We renegotiated it. Now it’s a really great deal for us. One in four U.S. manufacturing jobs disappeared almost overnight. Biden was strongly in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Would have destroyed our automobile manufacturing business. It would have been a disaster for our country. I ended it, but I approved the Dakota Access Pipeline immediately. The Keystone Pipeline, 48,000 jobs.
Donald Trump: (40:23)
One of the great rip offs. It was done in my opinion, to hurt our country because we have so much energy. We’re now energy independent was I got out of this horrible Paris Climate Accord, which was a rip off on our country. It would have shipped millions of American jobs to China while allowing China to pollute with impunity. And they don’t even enter the agreement until 2030. So, it would have been a disaster. So many things are stacked against us. Even in the World Trade Organization, China is considered a developing nation. Therefore, they get tremendous, guess what? We don’t accept it. We’ve informed them, we don’t accept it. And we’re not approving any of those judges until such time as that ends.
Donald Trump: (41:14)
So time and again, sleepy Joe Biden put China first and America last, even to a point where his son who had absolutely… Where’s Hunter, has anyone seen Hunter? He’s had absolutely no experience, walked away with one and a half billion dollars to manage, that’s millions of dollars a year. And if you go to the pros of Wall Street, they’ll tell you it’s an impossibility. It was a 10 minute meeting. He walked away with one and a half billion from China. How do you think he’s going to do negotiating, Biden against China? Nobody’s done what I’ve done to China, to Russia. By the way, remember, we were going to be in a war with North Korea. What happened to the war? We’re getting along Kim Jong Un. We get along. Let’s see what happens. And meantime, it’s almost four years. Remember we were going to be in a war.
Donald Trump: (42:05)
Look at all those people back, that’s a lot of people. That’s a lot of people. Look at all the fake news. Isn’t that incredible. That’s a lot of fake news back there, Scott. At the end of Joe Biden’s eight years as vice president, nearly 2 million Americans of prime working age had dropped out of the workforce. Our factories were stolen. Our country was doing lousy. He lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs. He was, by the way, a disaster on swine flu. He got a horrible rating in Gallup. Look at the Gallup poll. So they call it H1N1 right? You remember? H1 swine flu, H1N1. He calls it N1H1, but I don’t hold them in that one. That’s one of the small mistake. The bigger mistakes is what he says He’s at a different state when he’s speaking. “Great to be in the great state of Ohio,” but no, no, no, we’re not in Ohio.
Donald Trump: (43:08)
You know what you know what you do when that happens? You just walk off because there’s nothing you can do to recover. It’s happened to him like what, six times? Almost every time. That’s why he doesn’t talk. He’s shot, he’s shot. We got to say, look, one thing I’ve learned Putin, President Xi of China, Kim Jong Un, Erdogan of Turkey. They are world-class chess players. We can’t have a guy who’s shot and in his best years wasn’t very good. He wasn’t very good. We can’t have, these guys are world-class chess players.
Donald Trump: (43:49)
They’re all dreaming of Joe Biden. I’ll tell you who’s dreaming about them is Iran. If we win, and when we win, we are going to have a deal with Iran immediately. They’re just waiting, hoping that Biden gets in. Hoping John Kerry is saying, “Oh, he should have…” He, by the way, if anybody violated the Logan Act, it was John Kerry. John Kerry, not General Flynn. John Kerry.
Donald Trump: (44:14)
The cost of health insurance for American families had skyrocketed under Obama and Biden by $4,800 and nearly 11 million more Americans were on food stamps. So Biden’s abysmal record, but you do have to check swine flu because that was peanuts compared to this monster. This monster is the worst thing that’s happened in this world since 1917. Where it could have been a hundred million people died. Swine flu though, look at his ratings in Gallup, check them out. They gave them really bad ratings, Joe Biden. Not that that matters, but that does matter. When a guy is critical and we’ve done an incredible job, including among the best numbers in the world, Joe Biden’s abysmal record-
Donald Trump: (45:03)
Among the best numbers in the world, Joe Biden’s abysmal record of failure and betrayal ended the day I took the oath of office. We got our people back working. We made real deals with foreign countries.
Donald Trump: (45:18)
I told Japan prime minister, Robbie, great guy, but I said, “Prime minister, you have to build places in Michigan. You have to build your places in other areas of our country. It’s not fair. We have a big deficit. Go to Wisconsin, go to Ohio, go to these places.” He said he’s going to do it. Many, many Japanese plants now are being built all over our country. Somebody had to ask him to do it. Somebody had to tell them to do it. It’s not fair. And it was all happening. Then it came in, now it’s going out, watch what’s going to happen. Watch how good the third quarter is. The third quarter is coming up right before the election. Watch how good Scott Walker … even you will be impressed by those numbers, even Scott.
Donald Trump: (46:11)
But we passed massive tax cuts. We passed massive regulation cuts, and you know what? You might not feel this, maybe the most important thing I did for making the economy great wasn’t just the tax cuts, it was the regulation cuts because the regulation cuts allowed companies to go out and build projects that they couldn’t get approved for 15 years and 20 years. Big deal.
Donald Trump: (46:43)
We replaced probably the worst trade deal ever NAFTA with the brand new USMCA, which puts us right at the top. And now Canada and Mexico are doing what’s right for our country. It’s been a great deal. And when the Wisconsin timber industry was being threatened by administration, took immediate action. We imposed tariffs on dumped foreign goods and subsidized products, saving countless timber jobs all across your state, and you know exactly what I’m talking about. You were taken advantage of by stupid US policy. Canada was taking advantage of this country. Not anymore. If Biden and the crew get in, the radical left will bring timber production to a total halt. I stood up to China’s decades of trading abuses. And when China targeted our farmers, we provided $28 billion in relief, we gave our farmers. I said to Secretary Perdue, secretary of agriculture, “Sonny, how much they’ve targeted our farmers. How much have they been targeted for? ” Sir, two years ago it was 12 billion, last year it was 16 billion, 28 billion total.” I said, “Guess what? We’re charging tariffs of $28 billion to China.” We charged so much more and we gave 12 billion, and 16 and 28. We gave … any farmers in here, any farmers? Did I do a good job for you, please? I don’t hear any farmers complaining. Am I right? We did a good job.
Donald Trump: (48:29)
I’ll tell you what, with a more typical president … I want to be nice, more typical, every farmer would be out of business right now, but we gave 28 billion to the farmers think of that. And the farmers are doing well. And then we signed a deal with China. And I was very excited because I had a very good relationship with President Xi. We signed a great deal. And under the deal, they would buy $240 billion, 50 billion of farm product and then manufacturing. Once the China flu came in, once the China stuff came in, I was not … really, I wasn’t, I couldn’t, it was different. But I have to tell you, four days ago, the corn order was the largest corn order in the history of ordering corn.
Donald Trump: (49:17)
It was the biggest China ordered two days. The biggest order in the history of corn. Then they did, if you look at soybeans, it was the largest soybean order in history, in history, and also beef cattle, et cetera. So it just shows you how smart China is. We sign a deal and the plague comes in. It might’ve been a mistake. It might’ve been on purpose. Who knows what happened? We’ll figure it out. But whatever it was, it was no good. They could have stopped it. But they know my attitude, I don’t like it. I don’t like it. So a normal country that’s not so smart in that position, Scott would have said, “Oh, we don’t like the way he’s talking about us. Let’s immediately shut down.” He didn’t do that. They said, “Let’s order more from the farmers than we’ve ever ordered. Biggest corn, biggest soybean, biggest cattle.”
Donald Trump: (50:08)
And now I’m getting my farmers saying, “Sir, we’re starting to like China.” I said, “You know what? We got to be very careful. Do you understand that?” So what they’ve done is they’ve gone out, they’ve made massive orders. So think how smart that is. 99% of people in that position would say, “Well, we’re not going to order anymore.” They say, “Let’s order so much that they become almost reliant on us.” Very smart, very, very smart. America has spent nearly four years cleaning up the mess we inherited from Joe Biden’s 47 year worth of disaster.
Donald Trump: (50:45)
It’s incredible. He’s in there for 47 years, he does nothing. Now all of a sudden, he’s going to do all these things. He’s going to get tough on China. Sure. China will own the United States if we don’t make this deal and we will [inaudible 00:51:00] if we don’t get elected, China will own the … mark by word. Well, I hope you’re not going to be able to test it out. China will own the United States. Iran will insist on an even better deal than they made with Obama. They got $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash, green cash for nothing. We got nothing out of that deal. And I terminated that deal. I terminated that deal. And we moved the capital of Israel to Jerusalem. That’s for the evangelicals. It’s amazing with that. The evangelicals are more excited about that than Jewish people. It’s incredible. But we did, we did that. And Golan Heights, don’t forget Golan Heights. We did Golan Heights. So we’ve done a lot. In February, Biden said, “If you elect me your taxes are going to be raised. They’re not going to be cut.” Now [inaudible 00:07:05], how the hell do you do this? That will [inaudible 00:07:09]. Only in this state can we get away with it, but you happen to be right. You happen to be right. So I just want to say this. This has been an incredible experience for me getting to know you. I’ve been here a lot. We won this state. We weren’t expected to win this state.
Donald Trump: (52:30)
We’ve been great for each other. We’ve been great for each other. It’s a partnership in a sense, but we’ve been great for each other. We brought a lot of business to this state. We’re bringing a lot more business to this state, whether it’s the ships, or the crops or any one of so many different things, especially maybe the trade deal with Canada and Mexico, because of Wisconsin and your specialized milk, a small subject, but the right farmers got me at the right time and they said, “Wow, you guys are really being taken advantage of with Canada charging you 287% tariff.” I think you mostly know about that. But unless you were up here a lot like I was, you’d never find that out. And I worked with Scott and I worked with others and we solved all of these problems. We solved all of them, Scott, right? This is the most important election we ever had. We’ve got to stop these radical left maniacs. We’ve got to win this election. We have many things to do. We want to finish it up. It’s no different. You plant a tree, it takes a little time to grab on. In addition, we have other things we’re going to do. More regulation cutting, even more tax cutting. We’re going to be doing very substantial tax cuts because that’s an incentive toward growth and we’re going to do it. And we prove to be right. We prove to be 100% right. We’re not letting them raise your taxes on you and destroy everything that we’ve done. So I just want to thank the incredible people of Wisconsin.
Donald Trump: (54:40)
You really are. You really are. You’re a state that despite everything, everything that they were saying, “Well, Wisconsin, can’t be one.” Guess what? And I think we’re way far ahead. I do believe we’re way far ahead. Where we were, if you look back four years, I think we have much more spirit. You see, this as easier in a sense. Now, the virus made it a little bit more difficult, maybe a lot more difficult because all of a sudden, something happened that nobody ever even thought about, but we handled it. We handled it and we handled it well. And we’re now helping other countries with the ventilators and other things. But the easier part is, I used to come up as a businessman. I was very successful. And I’d say, “We’re going to do this. We’re going to do tax cuts. We’re going to …”
Donald Trump: (55:26)
Even Space Force, I never even talked about Space Force, but we did more … somebody said we actually did more than we promised. That’s never happened with a politician before. We did actually more, but I never talked about Space Force. And then I got into office. I said, “We need that.” Because you look at what China’s doing, what Russia’s doing, what others are looking at. So we have Space Force first time in 78 years since the air force that that’s happened, full scale, so it’s great, and you’re a big beneficiary of that as you know. So we have to win the election. We can’t play games. Get out and vote. Do those a beautiful absentee ballots or just make sure your vote gets counted. Make sure because the only way we’re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged, remember that. It’s the only way we’re going to lose this election.
Donald Trump: (56:24)
So we have to be very careful. Look, we have more than this election, that’s a big statement. The only way they’re going to win is that way. And we can’t let that happen. And our post office, we’re going to make our post office great. It’s been a disaster for many years. We’re going to take care of the men and women in the post office and we’re going to make it great. Right now it’s a laughingstock. Amazon and these companies come and they drop all of their packages into the post office. And the post office loses just hundreds of billions of dollars delivering these packages. Let them deliver it or let them pay the right price. So that’s it. But we’re going to make our post office strong. We’re going to make our post office really strong and really great.
Donald Trump: (57:14)
We’re going to be proud of it again. It lost $78 billion in a short period of time over the last 12 or 13 years, $78 billion. We want to make our post office strong. We want to be proud of it. I want to thank you very much. You’ve been my friends, my true friends. We will win and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Aug 14, 2020",7:00 P.M. EDT,"President Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much. What a nice group of people. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to treat you right. They’re not. They’re not treating you right, but we’re going to change that around quickly.
President Donald Trump: (00:19)
Pat, I’ve been a fan of yours for a long time. I’ve known you for a long time. You do one hell of a job, and you’re pretty popular with these people I see. [crosstalk 00:00:28]. Thank you, Pat. Well, maybe I’ll say a few words. It’s appropriate in light of everything that’s going on. When you look at all of the statistics, all of the numbers, New York’s finest, I love, and you’re the finest, they just don’t let you do the job [crosstalk 00:00:44]. They won’t let you do your job, that’s all it is.
President Donald Trump: (00:49)
So it’s my great honor to proudly accept something that Pat’s going to give me in a little while, so I’ll hold off on the word endorsement, but he’s going to give me an endorsement, I understand. And I have deeply and profoundly admired the brave men and women, as you know, of New York City’s finest, and I’ve admired you my whole life. My whole life I’ve watched you do a job like nobody else. Nobody else has done it. And truly, you’re the best of the best and I’m grateful. And I’m very happy that you’re here, and we’ll have a little fun for a little while, but first we’re going to talk a little business. We have to talk business because we have to straighten out our city. Our city’s a mess.
President Donald Trump: (01:33)
Every day, the courageous offices of NYPD put your lives on the line to protect the innocent and to put violent criminals behind bars. You protect people you’ve never met before. You know, I’ve heard that expression a long time ago, and it always means something to me. You’re protecting people with your lives, people that you’ve never met before, and you’ve done an incredible job.
President Donald Trump: (01:56)
And the world will never forget the New York police offices who ran into the smoke and flames of 9/11, I was there, many never to return. We salute the heroes of NYPD and we salute our law enforcement heroes all across the nation. I was responsible, along with a couple of people that were right in this audience, for getting you some very good and large payments so that we can take care of some of the people that were hurt so badly. Longterm hurt they call it, right? Longterm hurt, but we got it done and we got it signed. We got it signed and we’re taking of a lot of people.
President Donald Trump: (02:37)
And we want to thank our great firefighters also, right alongside of you, right? Our great firefighters.
President Donald Trump: (02:44)
As we gather today, our country is suffering from a radical far left movement. It’s not even to be believed when you see this, what they’re thinking. Where did these people come from? Where do they come from? That is trying to defame, demoralize, defund, dismantle, and dissolve our great police departments. It’s a left wing war on cops.
President Donald Trump: (03:07)
If Sleepy Joe Biden were to become precedent, he would immediately pass legislation to gut every single police department in America. You know that. And probably, she’s a step worse. She’s a step worse, Kamala. I was sort of hoping he was going to pick Pocahontas, but that [ inaudible 00:03:32]. She of Indian heritage number. Remember I said I have more Indian than her, I have more Indian than she does? And I went into it. I went into it at great length and I turned out to be right. I have none and I had more than she had. She’s another beauty.
President Donald Trump: (03:51)
Portland and Chicago are the left’s roadmap to America, and sadly, what’s happened over the last year in New York City. And it’s an incredible thing to look at, an incredible, incredible thing. And I just saw somebody here named Rudy Giuliani. Do you know Rudy Giuliani? Where’s Rudy? Is he around here? Get up here, Rudy. Get up. What are you doing down there, Mr. Mayor? This the greatest Mayor our city has ever had. Rudy, come on up here. Come on up. What a great… And he’s a man who is loyal and dedicated and tough. He got on television to defend me. He said things that even I wouldn’t say. He was brutal. He is incredible. He knew. He got it.
President Donald Trump: (04:40)
Joe Biden’s national police strategy will be modeled on the Bill DeBlasio, catastrophe. It’s a catastrophe. No one will be safe in Biden’s American, no city, no town, no suburb will be spared. And you see how I did something to help the suburbs of our country last week? A lot of people don’t want to even talk about it, but we did something that nobody else would have done. They’re ruining your suburbs. They want to ruin it. They want to destroy their housing values and your safety. But we ended it. We ended the program entirely. Somebody said, “Let’s amend it.” I said, “No, let’s end it.”
President Donald Trump: (05:22)
The Biden-Harris agenda, and I guess Harris could be bigger than you think in terms of the importances of vice president. They said there’s never been a more important pick, but in the end it’s not going to matter because we’re going to win. [crosstalk 00:05:34]. You know, honestly, we don’t have a choice. We have to win. This country will go to hell. The stock markets will crash. Your 401ks are going to be worthless. You’ll see. You’ll see what would happen, crime all over the place.
President Donald Trump: (05:48)
I mean, you take a look at Portland. You take a look at Chicago, and I can name plenty of other cities, but I don’t want to embarrass anybody. My agenda is anti-crime and pro-cop all the way and that’s what it’s got to be.
President Donald Trump: (06:03)
So in recent months, New York City has witnessed the horrors that result from putting extreme left politicians into power. DeBlasio has launched a crusade against, and he really has, he has launched a real crusade against the police like I don’t think anybody’s ever really seen, but there are cases that are just as bad. There are some cases, radical left, that may be even are worse.
President Donald Trump: (06:31)
The mobs have scrawled disgusting slogans such as cops must die. Think of this, cops must die and kill all cops. Okay? Who would even have thought 10 years ago that was possible? On the side of buildings, they put those terms. And they vandalized St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral, with horrible, horrible statements, horrible phrases. And then of course that disgusting chant, “Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon,” right? Remember that?
President Donald Trump: (07:09)
And now, all of a sudden, it becomes mainstream. It becomes, “Oh, isn’t this wonderful?” They were talking about you. You know that, right? We just can’t forget it because we have to bring law and order back to our cities, back to our country, and we’re doing it. Wherever we go, we do it. But when you have the radical left running it, no good.
President Donald Trump: (07:30)
Rioters have rampaged through Manhattan and looted Fifth Avenue and an NYPD Sargent was left, as you know very well, in critical condition after being rundown with a car. A Molotov cocktail was thrown into a police vehicle in Brooklyn. And NYPD’s highest ranking uniform chief and other offices were beaten in broad daylight on the Brooklyn Bridge. And they’re not allowed to fight back. You’re not allowed to fight back. You fight back, you lose your pension, you lose your life. They put you in jail you fight back. No, you got to be able to fight back.
President Donald Trump: (08:06)
I mean, to me, one of the saddest, and I don’t want to embarrass anybody, but one of the saddest things, Rudy, that I’ve ever seen, Pat, was when they were dumping water on the heads of two of your fellow officers. And I wish they fought back. I promise nothing would have happened to them. Because who even knew that was water? It could have been plenty of other things. It probably was actually. But it could have been some very dangerous material, not water. And they didn’t fight back. The first time I’ve ever seen that. I wish they did. I wish they did. I wish I could have talked to them. I said, “Fight back. I swear you’ll be protected.”
President Donald Trump: (08:44)
This is the left’s vision for the future of the United States of America. If they win this election, November 3rd, got to get out, got to get everybody you know. You know, the Democrats have an advantage because they have certain people that automatically vote. And we’re going from New York. We’re going for New York [crosstalk 00:09:02]. Because we did well last time. You know, New York is not supposed to be Republican territory. It was Ronald Reagan. But a lot of the people left. A lot of the people that voted for Ronald Reagan left. That was the last time. And they voted for Ronald Reagan, but they left. They went on to other places. They got tired of being abused and high taxes and all of the other problems.
President Donald Trump: (09:26)
And we’re going to go and run and we’re going to run on law and order, and we’re going to run our lower taxes, and we’re going to run on doing something with salt. You know what the salt is? Remember Schumer? Schumer said, “I try and bring home things to my people in New York.” You know what he brought home? Salt. For those of you that don’t know, look it up. It’s not good.
President Donald Trump: (09:50)
But if they win this election, every city in America will be under siege. You know that. Because the police are good in Seattle and they’re good in all of these different places I talked about. They’re not being let do their job. Can’t do their job.
President Donald Trump: (10:06)
Their pro-crime agenda, the Biden-Harris group will also crush our economy because there is no prosperity in cities that are ruled by fear. And I even think the politicians are afraid. If you look at Portland, the Mayor is trying to say, “Oh, these are my friends.” And then he goes in there, they want to beat the hell out of him. And then the fake news doesn’t report that. They’ll show him standing there with the sound down so you don’t hear what they’re saying to the Mayor. Fortunately, he had five body guards when he went in, right? But it was very dangerous for him. And I don’t know if he’s doing this at a stupidity or out of fear. Because I think they’re afraid actually.
President Donald Trump: (10:44)
Yeah. It sounds like one my friends.
President Donald Trump: (10:49)
My administration has made clear that the Department of Justice will partner arm-in-arm with our police heroes. And we’re with you all the way and we’ll prosecute all federal violations to the fullest extent of the law. But you know, we have to be invited in, unless we do something very drastic, which is a big statement, but we have to be invited in. But you don’t need help. You guys don’t need help. You have the greatest police force in the world. You have the greatest in the world. All they have to do is tell your top people to do your job and you’re going to do it properly. You’re not going to do something in excess to what [inaudible 00:11:26], but they want to tell you to do your job and you’re not going to have any crime in New York. It’s going to go down like it did with Rudy Giuliani. It’s going to go down so fast.
President Donald Trump: (11:35)
That happened quickly, Rudy. That didn’t take too long.
Rudy Giuliani: (11:38)
Not at all.
President Donald Trump: (11:39)
That didn’t take too long. You, he looks good enough. Let’s draft Rudy. You better be careful, he’d win it. He’d win very easily. Because people want that back. They want it back. That’s why I think, I really am, I’m putting it into play. Most people would say, “Oh, spend your time in other places,” but I’m going to put it. We did very well. We did incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various, Staten Island was-
President Donald Trump: (12:03)
Incredibly upstate, Long Island, all of the various … Staten Island was great, right? Staten Island was great. By the way, Joe Rose is a disaster. I will tell you that. I hope they get him out of there. He’s a total lightweight in many ways. Joe Rose, get him out.
Speaker 3: (12:17)
Get him out.
President Donald Trump: (12:18)
He turns out he’s another beauty. My administration will so increase funding for police so that we can hire more police offices nationwide. We’re increasing funding very substantially. And in many cases, they don’t want it. They want to put into a different group. I said, “What’s that group all about?” And it’s called socialism, and it doesn’t work. Never will work.
Crowd: (12:41)
Boo.
President Donald Trump: (12:42)
By contrast, New York City voted to defund the police by $1 billion, if you can believe it, even after experiencing the bloodiest June in nearly 25 years. It’s dismantled an elite team of crime fighters, that crime fighting unit that your friends, there were incredible people. They were making us all safe. Nationwide, they were making us safe and we got to get them back. We got to bring them back. Hopefully, they don’t get a job for too much money. Tell them not to look too hard because we’re going to bring them back. We’ll get them back. They’re the best. [Rudy 00:13:17] started that. They’re the best. Joe Biden and Kamala, they always say Kamala, Kamala, Harris have a plan to spread this mayhem to every community in America.
President Donald Trump: (13:29)
Now, in all fairness to Joe, he doesn’t really know what’s happening. They say, “Joe, we’re going to spread it around. Oh, okay. Okay.” This guy doesn’t answer any questions. He gets up today. He made a statement. I just did an incredible deal with UAE. You saw that, right? Everyone’s shocked. Even the New York Times said it was incredible deal. Can you believe? The New York Times? I can’t even believe it. Thomas Friedman, they wrote an incredible editorial. It was a great deal. So we did this deal. Nobody else did it. In fact, we were at a huge deficit because of the horrible deal that Obama made with Iran. Gave them $150 billion, billion, not million. 150 million’s a lot. That would be too much also. 150 billion then gave them 1.8 billion in cash. I broke the deal. I terminated the deal, but we made a deal, UAE and Israel. And sleepy Joe got up and said he made the deal. I said, “Whoa.” Did anybody hear that? He actually took credit for making that deal.
Speaker 4: (14:31)
Debate him.
President Donald Trump: (14:33)
For a change, I’m being praised all over the world for making that deal, and that’s just the beginning. I think they just said, “Say this Joe. Say that you made it.” It’s like it was Obama’s economy right? Before the plague, we had the greatest economy in history. Greatest economy anywhere in the world, let alone ours. And now we’re building it back up very rapidly. You see the numbers. But they were taking credit. They said, “Oh, this was Obama. Obama.” He said manufacturing would never come back. That was Obama. Manufacturing has come back big. In fact, even two days ago, they announced incredible numbers. When asked recently if he favors cutting police budget, Biden replied. “Yes, absolutely.” But I’m not sure honestly he knew what he was replying to so we’re not … “Yes, absolutely. What did I say? What was I referring to?” You could use that clip for a million different things right? Yes, absolutely. You never say that as a politician. You always finish out.
President Donald Trump: (15:26)
Biden has been described by police as and he described the police, you saw that, as the enemy. He said it’s the enemy. Kamala Harris applauded LA’s recent decision to slash its police budget, and LA really went to town on it, you saw that. Millions and millions of dollars off their budget. After the riots in Minneapolis, Kamala encouraged Americans to donate money to the so-called Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed out rapists, assaulters and murderers. They bailed them right out of jail. Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. We can’t lose this election. Okay?
Crowd: (16:05)
[crosstalk 00:04:06].
President Donald Trump: (16:05)
We can’t loose.
Speaker 5: (16:06)
Not going to happen.
President Donald Trump: (16:08)
We’re building a big wall. We’re building the wall. It’s up to almost … Look at her. She’s all excited about that. That’s-
Speaker 5: (16:15)
Build the wall, build the wall-
Crowd: (16:15)
Build the wall, build the wall, build the wall, build the wall-
President Donald Trump: (16:15)
Yeah, we’re building. It’s up to 280 miles. Will be up … That’ll be completed-
Speaker 6: (16:27)
[inaudible 00:00:16:27].
President Donald Trump: (16:27)
You’re right. I like her. No, you’re right. And you know who like the wall? The Southern border, you know who like at the most? Hispanics, because they know the area. They know what comes in and they want to be safe. They want to keep their good jobs. They want to keep their beautiful houses. They’ve done well, but they know the area the best. We’re doing great with the Hispanics. As San Francisco district attorney, she chose not to seek the death penalty against a gang member who killed a San Francisco police officer going against the wishes of the officer’s wife, going against the wishes of the police. In his unity manifesto written with socialist … Bernie Sanders is another beauty, Bernie. Crazy Bernie. We’ve got names for all of them no? What’s better? Sleepy Joe or slow Joe? Tell me.
Crowd: (17:19)
[crosstalk 00:05:19].
President Donald Trump: (17:19)
What is better?
Crowd: (17:21)
[crosstalk 00:05:22].
President Donald Trump: (17:23)
I go back and forth.
Crowd: (17:25)
[crosstalk 00:05:24].
President Donald Trump: (17:26)
I go back and-
Crowd: (17:27)
[crosstalk 00:17:27].
President Donald Trump: (17:28)
Okay, let’s do it. Who likes Slow Joe?
Crowd: (17:33)
Yay.
President Donald Trump: (17:33)
Who likes Sleepy Joe?
Crowd: (17:37)
Yeah.
President Donald Trump: (17:37)
That’s what I thought. I got all these guys telling me, “Oh, you ought to do. We don’t like sleepy because it’s rude.” They said it’s rude. I said, “We’re talking about the president of the United States.” I can tell you one thing. Putin and Kim Jong Un and President Xi of China, they’re not sleepy. We’re never going to say sleepy or slow, and we can’t have slow, sleepy people dealing with them either because we were doing very well against all of them. All of them. And we’re have a good relationship now. Remember North Korea? We were going to go to war with North Korea. Obama would have been in a war. Millions of people could have been killed in that war. Where’s the war? Everybody said, “Trump will be in war in the first week.” Where’s the war? In fact, we’re bringing people out of the endless Wars. The Wars that where their doing your job. They’re policemen and that’s great, but they want to fight. They want to win. We didn’t let people win. Bring them back. We shouldn’t have been there in the first place. So we bring them back, and what we’re doing is bringing them back with great dignity.
President Donald Trump: (18:41)
It’s incredible what’s happened. We’ve totally rebuilt our armed forces, $2.5 trillion. We’ve given you hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment. Pat, you know that. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment came out of … It was collecting dust, right? It was army surplus stuff and all the different … It was beautiful stuff and Obama didn’t want you to have it. They said it made you look too strong, too tough. You look too military. So they said, “Let them get shot.” Much of it was protective equipment. You know that. I released it all. I gave it to all the police departments all across the country and I have had more thank yous for that. And someday, they’re going to have to explain why they didn’t want to do it. And this was sitting there. It was not going to be used. A lot of it was new, but it wasn’t going to be used. And I said, “Give it to our great police all over the country.” And we did and it’s been great.
President Donald Trump: (19:34)
And just to finish up, I call it the manifesto because Bernie Sanders, he was going to make an agreement and they were going to go a little bit further right. They didn’t. They went further left than Bernie was. So in the manifesto, Biden pledges to abolish cash bail. How about that? No cash bail. No bail, meaning that violent and dangerous criminals would simply be released after arrest. New York tried this insane policy and crime surged nearly 25% in New York City and now it’s up much, much higher than that. This is an old statistic. It’s up much higher than that. So nationwide, the Biden plan to abolish bail would release over 400,000 criminals on our streets.
President Donald Trump: (20:23)
So all I’m saying is this. We have the greatest police departments. We have great police. We have great forces. They have to be allowed to do their job. And I’ve seen Pat and I’ve seen you. You’re going to have a bad apple. You’re going to have somebody who makes a horrible mistake. You’re going to have somebody has a bad moment, but it may be just a bad apple. We’ve seen it. But that doesn’t mean we’re going to close up our police departments. And like in Minneapolis, tell them to run. Leave, leave. Did you ever see anything like that? Where they left? Where they left? We can’t ever let that happen. We sent in the National Guard five or six days later. We waited, we waited, we waited. Within one hour, the whole thing was … You never heard of anything. On these monuments and statues, you saw that? They were trying to rip them down. They ripped some down. I immediately signed an order that if you get caught ripping down a monument or a statue, you get 10 years in jail. 10 years.
President Donald Trump: (21:26)
And I don’t know about you, I haven’t seen too many statues being ripped down lately. They were going to have a march on Washington, Washington. They wanted to rip down statues. I said, “So wait a minute. You’re going to rip down statues, you’re going to go to jail for 10 years.” I signed it publicly. Very public. You got to let them know or otherwise, it’s not fair. They get 10 years, they didn’t know about it right? Wise guys. So we let them know you get 10 years in jail. I took an old law because they don’t do those laws today. Today, get that through the house. Tell Nancy Pelosi we’re going to give somebody 10 years. She’s terrible. Look at what’s happened to San Francisco. Look at the tents. Look at the homeless. That’s Nancy. She ought to go home and clean up her own city, but take a look.
President Donald Trump: (22:14)
But it’s 10 years in jail. They were going to have a big march on Washington. They were going to come down and knock down. They had them earmarked. And as soon as they announced that, nobody showed up. It was amazing. Big march, nobody showed up. They said, “No, we’re going to do it the following …” That was a Thursday night. “We’re going to do it the next night, Friday.” Nobody showed up except four people. They all got arrested because they were the four people that the media had on top of the statue of Andrew Jackson doing damage. Almost got it down. And I’ll say something. The Washington, the D.C. police were great because they had the ropes. You saw the ropes. They were ready to pull it down. They were all set and our guys said, “Stop it.” And those guys ran in and that thing was over. Those Washington, those D.C. police did a job. That wasn’t like you know. They did a job. So we’re going to give you back your stature. We’re going to give you back your status. I hate to say it, but it’s been taken away. We’re going to give you back the right to be New York’s finest, the finest of all time, the greatest of all time, and we’re going to win on November 3rd. And the people that didn’t love Trump, never Trumpers, a lot of them are saying, “I’m starting to like Trump a lot,” because they see what’s happening. And we’re going to give New York a real shot and I think we have one hell of a shot at doing it. I just said this morning, the New York Post, which has been great. The New York post had a cover story about that. They came and interviewed me at the Oval Office and they talked about law and order in the city. And I said, “I did very well, Republican wise. I did very well.” We did great, and I really believe that that solid core of people has to be real. First of all, they’re leaving. A lot of them are leaving, but they have to be discuss-
President Donald Trump: (24:03)
I mean first of all they are leaving a lot of them are leaving, but they have to be disgusted with what’s going on. So I said then and there and I said it today. I put it out today strongly, we’re going to go and give New York a real shot. I think we have a real chance of winning New York, but we’re going to give you so much of what you’re looking for. Because I know exactly it’s so easy you need leadership, you need money, you can’t defund. It has to go the other way. You need equipment.
President Donald Trump: (24:28)
But what do you need more than anything else is your dignity and respect. You need respect, you need your dignity back and this guy has taken your dignity away and your respect away. And I am telling you on November 3rd you’re going to be getting it back like you haven’t gotten it back before. Because this is really a referendum. So I want to thank you very much. And Pat, thank you very much. Fellas thank you.
Speaker 7: (24:59)
USA, USA, USA. Mr. President, today it’s an honor for me to stand at this podium and be the voice for 24,000 New York city police officers, proud police officers that are here today chanting USA, chanting Trump for president and they mean it each and every time they say it. Mr. President, it’s obvious where you hold the NYPD in your heart. We heard the news this morning that you got some family news that your brother had fallen ill. And naturally we thought well, we may have to postpone this. The president may not be able to come. And then our phones rang and we were told that the president will visit his brother and then he will visit with you. That’s where he puts you. New York city police officers and family. That’s the type of president we have.
Speaker 7: (26:16)
Mr. President what we all have in common here today is that we all have a police officers shield in our hip pocket. We all have friends and family that are here to support you. And more importantly, in this crowd is our family members too. The ones that worry what happens when their loved one takes that last step off the stoop and goes to work and they know they may not come back. And we know you understand that Mr. President, because you’re constantly always loud about the support for New York city police officers. Mr. President, this city you helped build, the borough where your father started in South Jamaica is sliding back. The borough in which you build so many skyscrapers was just recently looted. Our city is sliding back because the mantra, the false narrative that not only city hall, the second floor in the state house and those that want to become president are passing this false narrative that New York city police officers and law enforcement are evil.
Speaker 7: (27:34)
How absurd is that? That they blame us for society’s ills? Well, let me tell you this Mr. President I know you know that. The most compassionate people on the face of the earth are New York city police officers. Mr. President, if you look at the crime numbers in New York city we’re sliding back where we’re at shootings. We’re at shooting levels back to 1993. That’s because of that narrative against the police officers, that’s where they’re handcuffing our members. That’s where they’re saying if you take a bad guy off the street that you will go to jail. Now that’s the upside down world. So what we can’t do is let that attitude spread beyond the city, beyond the state house and go to the white house Mr. President.
Speaker 7: (28:35)
So we here today for a reason, a reason that you understand to support not only New York city police officers, but law enforcement across this country. And this is not new for you Mr. President, you do it always. See, the sign of a leader is someone that will stand at a podium like this and speak the truth and will say what needs to be said and not be afraid to do it.
Speaker 7: (29:09)
Well, we are seeing leaders in our state that are following the crowd Mr. Mayor. Mr. President what they’re doing is not only following marches, they’re following riders. They’re trying to catch up and do whatever they can to make sure they’re happy. I often times wake up and say who were they listening to? They’re not listening to the folks in the neighborhoods that we patrol. They’re not listening to the folks that say we want police on our streets and we want to respect them. So today Mr. President, there’s two things that we’d like to do. We’d like to present you with a statue that means so much to New York city officers. This statue, we do not hand out lightly. This statue is very special to New York city police officers for what it represents. This is a police officer standing tall and proud with his hand on the shoulder of a child. Now that child represents not only a little boy, not only a little girl, but a crime victim, someone that needs our help, someone that was victimized. That’s what police officers do every day in this country and this city and this state. They stop, they put their hands, they give their comforting words, the compassionate words that helps everyone. Mr. President we know that you hold police offices in high esteem. So there’s not many of these that are given out, but we’re giving it to you today Mr. President. We hope that you can put this in a prominent spot and that people that can see it and realize that those that are in the mob that are tearing down what we do, our profession has a supporter in the oval office that understands what this stands for. Mr. President it’s my honor.
President Donald Trump: (31:40)
How does the oval office for that sound? Okay? Good?
Speaker 7: (31:47)
Mr. President, I said we have two things to present to you and we presented a special statue. But we also have some practical work to do because there’s election that we’re in the midst of. So I’m here to say this number one, I have 36 years on this job, 21 as the president of this fine organization. I cannot remember when we’ve ever endorsed for the office of president of the United States until now. That’s how important this is. Mr. President we’re fighting for our lives out there. We don’t want this to spread to the rest of the country. We need your strong voice across the country to say we have the support of law enforcement across this country. Now, many times people say that a union like ours, law enforcement groups give endorsements, not in the New York city PBA sir. In the New York city PBA Mr. President you earn the endorsement and you’ve earned this endorsement. I’m proud to give it.
President Donald Trump: (33:34)
Well, I just want to thank you that was incredible. I assumed it was given out because I see a lot of things given out and they shouldn’t be given out. But a special man, you are just really special people. You really are. You’re very brave people. I will say this, you read a lot of negatives. They have a lot of fake media, fake news, false news, call it whatever you want, corrupt news. But you have no idea how much the people of this country love our police departments, our police, our law enforcement, our border patrols, our ICE people. ICE they go into the toughest situations. They take out MS13 by the thousands and then they get abused. But they’re not really abused, they’re loved by the people of this country. And New York’s great police force is something that I grew up with.
President Donald Trump: (34:28)
I used to go with my father in Brooklyn to a little, I shouldn’t tell you this, a little hamburger place for lunch. And we’d see these big cops come in and they were great. And everybody stood at attention when they walked in and we’re going to get that back. You’re respected just the same, but they don’t allow it to happen. We’re going to allow it to happen. You are great, great people. And remember this, you are loved by our country, loved by our country and respected by our country.
President Donald Trump: (34:57)
And all we have to do is let you do your job, right? Just let you do your job. Pat, I think it might be appropriate. So we really do. We have New York city’s greatest mayor of all time. He took over a city that I don’t know, was worse. Maybe better. I don’t know what I’m going to ask Rudy what’s the difference between that city and the city of today? Certainly it caught up very quickly for a long while it was a lot better, but when Rudy ran it, it was incredible. The crime statistics, the murder. I hate to use that word, murder. I don’t know if this place has ever heard that word murder. It’s not into the word of murder.
President Donald Trump: (35:34)
But when you look at the stats, I looked at them the other day it was incredible what he was able to do in a short period of time with only New York’s finest. Without New York’s finest he couldn’t have done it. He let them do the job and he had three very great commissioners. He keeps telling me three great commissioners. I always say, “Who is the best?” He doesn’t want to tell me maybe he’ll tell you. But I’ve asked him many times, “Who is the best Rudy I want to know who? Who is the best?” He’ll never tell me, but there’s always the best, right? There’s always somebody. But I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words.
President Donald Trump: (36:03)
But I just want to thank you. I want to thank Pat. I’d love to ask Rudy to say a few words and we love you all. Thank you very much.
Rudy Giuliani: (36:06)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. It’s a beautiful thing to see.
Crowd: (36:15)
Rudy.
Rudy Giuliani: (36:18)
Thank you.

I know you since I was a little boy. My Uncle Willie, my Uncle, Bob, my Uncle Vincent, my Uncle Anthony were all New York City Police Officers. One was a Detective. One was a Sergeant. Then I had a fifth uncle, who was a firefighter, but I’m not going to mention that right now. I grew up with you and then I got to work with you as a prosecutor, and I get credit for bringing down crime more than any other mayor ever. Anywhere, but you did it. I didn’t do it. I know you did it. That’s why every time you were hurt, every time you were injured, I’d be the first one to show up at the hospital. Not because I’m a great guy, because it’s my duty to be there, because you got it done.
Rudy Giuliani: (37:08)
I hear people say, “Oh, we don’t need police officers to reduce crime.” Out of their f’ing mind’s out of their minds. Out of their minds. I went and acquired more police. We took over the Housing Police. We took over the Transit Police. We made them all one, because I needed to reassign them to the right places. We took police officers out of white neighborhoods that voted for me, who were really angry at me for doing it, and we put it into black neighborhoods where Al Sharpton would complain about us. But the people loved it and would ask me for more. People in Harlem asked me for more. Bedford-Stuyvesant and Fort Greene, all the places you know so well. You go to the people and the President is right and Pat is right. They want you. They respect you.
Rudy Giuliani: (37:55)
I have people of all races, black, white, Hispanic, come up to me now in the streets, and tell me, “Please, please tell someone we need more police. We love the police. Let them know it. Don’t don’t listen to these people on television. We love them.” Particularly, come from the black community, particularly. They know who you are. It’s just a bunch of, they’ve become really radicals who want to overthrow our way of life. That’s what they’re about. You’re a part of it. You’re in the way. You’re in the way of that. Being able to create a socialist government, to create a government where, well it’s going to be created because they get people to hate America. That’s why they burn statues. That’s why they burned flags. That’s why they kneel during the national anthem.
Crowd: (38:39)
We don’t kneel.
Rudy Giuliani: (38:43)
Of course, we don’t kneel. What do we do during the national anthem? We stand up, right? What do we do? That’s what we teach our children.
Crowd: (38:55)
[inaudible 00:00:38:56].
Rudy Giuliani: (38:55)
It’s all being done for a purpose though. It’s being done for a purpose. They want us to believe that our country was founded by an evil man, that our first president was an evil man. That the author of our liberty was an evil man, that the emancipator was an evil man, that the general who won the Civil War was an evil man, because they want to convince enough people, we’re a hateful country. They teach that in our schools now. 1000 schools have a curriculum, which says that America has never been able to overcome the horrible sin of slavery and that all Americans are responsible for it. Can you believe that? We’re teaching that to our children. They’re being forced-fed that in school, and then they get it from the media. It has to be you, the best representatives of the constitution, the law, fairness, decency, protection of people, have always been police offices because you do something that all the people who criticize you don’t do. You put your lives on the line every day to protect me and my family. I don’t do that and that’s why I honor you.
Rudy Giuliani: (40:06)
You made the right choice in this president. I was with him when he ran in 2016. I was with him for four straight months. He would campaign until 11 o’clock, 12 o’clock, one o’clock, two o’clock, three o’clock, four o’clock. All the kids would be asleep on the plane. He would be awake. No matter how late it was, when we’d get to the airport, everybody was exhausted. There’d a be about 30 cops that were there. Maybe the guys on the motorcycles, or couple of guys guarding the plane. Everybody wanted to rush on the plane and every other candidate I ever saw rushed on the plane. He never once rushed on the plane. No matter how far he had a walk, he went up to the uniform and he shook hands with every single one of them. He did it because it’s for real. He’s not a politician. He’s actually a real person. That’s why, he’s accomplished in three and a half years, more than any other president, I interviewed an African-American gentleman the other day. I have a tape. He said that this is the best president for the African-American community since Abraham Lincoln, nobody even close.
Crowd: (41:28)
Four more years. Four more years.
Rudy Giuliani: (41:30)
He’s the best president for police officers.
Crowd: (41:32)
Four more years. Four more years.Four more years. Four more years.
Rudy Giuliani: (41:37)
He just accomplished what nobody else was able to accomplish in the Middle East. Nobody has been able to bring a Gulf Arab state to say they’re going to recognize the state of Israel. No one has done that. Obama made it almost impossible to do it because he had an animosity toward Israel that was sick. He’s turned that all around. He’s turned around the reputation of our country in the world. He made it the greatest economy we’ve ever had. We got a terrible setback because of China, that owns Joe Biden. I have, I can prove that to you, but that’s another story. They own him. They own his son. They won his family. He doesn’t even have the room to negotiate with China. You’re cops. You know what I’m talking about, don’t you?
Crowd: (42:25)
[inaudible 00:06:26].
Rudy Giuliani: (42:26)
Yeah.
Crowd: (42:28)
[inaudible 00:06:28].
Rudy Giuliani: (42:28)
All that money for the kid, was for the kid. China’s going to give away $1.5 billion to that kid who can’t hold a job? I’m not going to say why. Some of you are probably detectives. You figure out, why did they give $1.5 billion to the Biden family when Joe Biden was negotiating for us, US? Oh, by the way, he lost in every negotiation, but the family made 1.5 billion. I don’t got to say anymore. You got it. I feel sorry for Joe. I feel sorry that he has the senility. I feel sorry for the country that he picked that horrible prosecutor. That woman is a bully. She’s a bully. Here’s what I mean by that. I know prosecutors like you know cops. She prosecuted little people and she wouldn’t prosecute big people.
Rudy Giuliani: (43:22)
All the politicians in San Francisco, all Willie Brown’s friends, they went free, but she went after 1500 marijuana smokers. Marijuana smokers, not people selling it, smokers. Then when she was asked if she smoked marijuana, she said, “ha, ha, ha, yeah.” Tell me this isn’t a horrible person. You put people in jail for something that you laugh about, but you put them in prison and take their liberty away because she wanted statistics, because she’s a bully. She can’t be that close to the … Oh my God. Thank you. I know what you guys can do and women. I know what you can do on the streets to protect us. I know what you can do politically too. Let’s get them elected. We need him right now more than he needs us. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (44:11)
Thank you. Does anyone else want to speak. Does anyone else want to … So again, it’s an honor that you came. I just want to pay my respects to a really good guy that I love. It’s my brother, he’s very ill and he would not have … I mean, he just said, “Don’t even think about it.” I really appreciate what he said. He’s having a very tough time, but I really appreciate being with you today. He respected you as much as I do. He respected you, like everybody. We all respect you and we’re going to let you do your job. We’re going to let you do your job. That’s all we have to do. Again, thank you very much. It’s such an honor to be with you, to get the endorsement pad of this group of incredible men and women is mind-blowing. Really it is.
Speaker 8: (45:15)
Thank you, very much.
President Donald Trump: (45:15)
Mind blowing and just, I’m going to leave you with this very simple phrase. I will never, ever let you down. I will never let you down. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much."
"Aug 13, 2020",5:37 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (12:04)
Thank you very much. It was just announced by Attorney General Barr that they’ve caught the killer of LeGend Taliferro. Horribly shot young man, wonderful young man. This just came out two minutes ago. So Attorney General Barr just announced, as you know, we named Operation Legend after LeGend Taliferro where we’re going to be helping out and are in the process of helping out cities throughout our country that have difficulty with crime, in particular, certain types of crime. So that’s really good news. They caught the killer of LeGend.
Donald Trump: (12:55)
Today, we saw Joe Biden continue to politicize a pandemic and to show his appalling lack of respect for the American people, that’s what it is. At every turn, Biden has been wrong about the virus, ignoring the scientific evidence, and putting left wing politics before facts and evidence. Sleepy Joe opposed both the China and the Europe travel bans. You know that. He opposed the China travel ban that I instituted very early and the Europe travel ban that I instituted quite early. If I listened to his advice, hundreds of thousands more people would’ve died. This is according to many people. I believe that Dr. Fauci agreed with that. He said that President Trump made a great decision when he put the ban on China.
Donald Trump: (13:55)
Joe Biden wants to fling open American borders, allowing the pandemic to infiltrate every US community based on his policies. He wants to have ridiculous open borders. I’ve been saying from the first day I started campaigning for this great office that you have open borders, you don’t have a country. You don’t have a country with open borders. So he wants open borders. The Democrats want open borders. And if you take a look at our southern border, we would have criminals pouring through. The wall is getting close to 290 miles long and it’s having a huge impact. So we disagree with him on that. That’s one of the many things that we disagree with. But while Joe Biden would allow rioters and looters and criminals and millions of illegal aliens to roam free in our country, he wants the federal government to issue a sweeping new mandate to law abiding citizens. He wants the president of the United States with the-
Donald Trump: (15:03)
… abiding citizens. He wants the President of the United States with the mere stroke of a pen to order over 300 million American citizens to wear a mask for a minimum of three straight months. I guess it’s just happened. He thinks it’s good politics, I guess. No matter where they live and no matter their surroundings, because different states are much different, both in terms of the atmosphere itself and also in terms of the corona problem. He does not identify what authority the president has to issue such a mandate or how Federal Law Enforcement could possibly enforce it, or why we would be stepping on governors throughout our country, many of whom have done a very good job and they know what is needed. Also many of our 50 states are doing the job at a level that, frankly, people are really surprised, including foreign governments that are calling us constantly and asking for advice.
Donald Trump: (16:09)
So I want to just say our governors have worked very hard. They’ve worked with Vice President Pence and myself and everybody else that’s been going. We have Scott now involved. And so Scott, congratulations, where you’ll be working with a lot of governors. You’ve already started. And Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx. If the president has the unilateral power to order every single citizen to cover their face in nearly all instances, what other powers does he have? That’s why he refused, Biden, to take questions. He couldn’t answer any of them, couldn’t answer the questions. He refuses to take questions. He never takes questions. I take questions. He never takes questions. And you sort of wonder what’s going on because they’re not that difficult. Some can be nasty, but they’re not that difficult. But he never takes questions. So he just, I guess, left. I didn’t see it, but I guess he just left the podium. Put it in your minds.
Donald Trump: (17:10)
My administration has a different approach. We have urged Americans to wear masks and I emphasized this is a patriotic thing to do. Maybe they’re great and maybe they’re just good. Maybe they’re not so good, but frankly, what do you have to lose? You have nothing to lose. So we do. And we’ve been saying wear them when it’s appropriate, especially in terms of social distancing. If you can’t distance enough and what do you have to lose? But again, it’s up to the governors and we want to have a certain freedom and we want to have a certain freedom. That’s what we’re about. At the same time, we also understand that each state is different and is facing unique circumstances. You have very, very different states facing very unique differences and circumstances. We’ve entrusted the governors of each state, elected by the people, to develop and enforce their own mask policies and other policies following guidance from the Federal Government and CDC. We’re working with each state to implement a plan based on the facts and science.
Donald Trump: (18:26)
We will continue to urge Americans to wear masks when they cannot socially distance, but we do not need to bring the full weight of the Federal Government down on law-abiding Americans to accomplish this goal. Americans must have their freedoms and I trust the American people and their governors very much. I trust the American people and the governors want to do the right thing to make the smart decisions. And Joe doesn’t, Joe doesn’t, Joe doesn’t know too much. Unlike the Biden approach, our approach is guided by science. That’s why we’re focused on protecting the high risk Americans. That is why we’re delivering effective medical treatments to dramatically reduce the fatality rate. And that is why we’re developing a vaccine and therapeutics and record time. You’ll see that I think very soon.
Donald Trump: (19:25)
Sleepy Joe rejects the scientific approach in favor of locking all Americans in their basements for months on end, which I think is something that Scott would be very opposed to. I think I can speak for you. We’ve been dealing pretty strongly over the last number of weeks. But he wants them in the basement for months on end. And you have governors that have been very, very strict on keeping people in their houses, keeping people in their, wherever they may be, apartments. And frankly, I don’t think the results are necessarily better than other results. But he wants to shut down our economy, close our schools and grind society to a halt, and he wants it done by a Federal decree. This would lead to a crippling, long-lasting depression. This would be a crippling, long-lasting depression.
Donald Trump: (20:22)
And yesterday I showed you the numbers about how well we’re doing coming back with auto sales and auto manufacturing and used car sales and housing sales at numbers that nobody would have believed. And we’re back and very strong. It’s a very strong V it’s almost a straight up V. We’ll be discussing that over the next couple of days, but the economy is coming back and the employment numbers over the last three months are a record in history of our country. And we’ll be back next year. I think we’ll be maybe even stronger than the previous year where we set every record in the book on employment and stock market. By the way, our stock market numbers are very close to record and NASDAQ is actually record over the last 14 days. For 14 times now it’s been record and that’s during what we hope will be the more final stages of the pandemic.
Donald Trump: (21:15)
So if we did what Biden wanted to do, it would shut down our health care system and lead to a massive increase in mortality, including suicide, overdose, heart disease, and countless other physical and mental harms. It is very, very bad on the other side of the equation when you do something like that. Those shutdowns are very punitive, very punitive. They hurt a lot of people in a lot of different ways through depression, through suicide, through so many other things, alcohol, drugs. Biden’s approach is regressive. It’s anti-scientific and it’s very defeatist, but it’d be very bad for our country. While Joe Biden has been playing politics from the sidelines, he has no clue. We’ve been solving problems and delivering tremendous results. The most advanced and robust testing system on the planet. The number one producer of ventilators in the world by far. Unprecedented, industrial mobilization, biggest since World War II. Operation Warp Speed to deliver life saving treatments and very soon a vaccine.
Donald Trump: (22:32)
What a plan by Joe Biden has actually laid out would do, we’ve really already accomplished. In fact, many of the things that was well reported over the last few days, every single thing he said to do, every single thing we did and we did them well. So Biden has no idea on his own. He only knows what he thinks we should do and he spews it out. And then he, I guess you could say he plagiarizes and he really did in our case because every single one of the events… I think Haley, we can say that was something we had already done. So we’ll defeat the virus, but not by hiding in our basements. He’s got to come out of his basement.
Donald Trump: (23:22)
We’ll defeat this virus through a common sense mitigation effort, shielding those at highest risk and unleashing America’s medical and scientific genius, which is what it is. And we’ve already been doing it and we’re very close to having something that’s going to be very, very special in the form of therapeutics and vaccines.
Donald Trump: (23:45)
To Joe, I would say stop playing politics with the virus, too serious. Partisan politics has no place here. It’s a shameful situation for anybody to try and score political points while we’re working to save lives and defeat the pandemic. In times of national challenge, America is and Americans and we are, by the way, we are working with countries from all over the world. And they’re trying to learn from us. And some of the countries that you spoke most well about are having a tremendous surge right now, but it’ll work out.
Donald Trump: (24:22)
But Americans must unite together and they must put politics aside and have to really unite for a common good. Three vaccines are in the final stage of clinical trials. They’re doing really well. We’re producing the most promising vaccine candidates in advance, as you know, part of the largest industrialization ever. It’s incredible when I meet with heads of companies that are doing this, that are the best companies anywhere in the world. It’s incredible where they are, how they’re doing and the speed with which they’re doing it and also the speed with which the FDA is approving things because by any other standard, you would have been two or three years away from being at the point that we’re at.
Donald Trump: (25:10)
By the end of this week, we will have shipped 1,846 rapid point of care testing devices to nursing homes, which are very important sources for people that are not handling the plague from China very well. This week alone, we’re sending 992 testing devices and 450,000 tests to more than 950 nursing homes across the country. And these tests are incredible. These are tests that are all new, very modern. And we’re also getting, on the tests that are not done immediately with the five to 15 minute timing, when they do send them to a lab, they’re coming back now in three days. So it’s a three day process, which is about as good as you can do. You have one day of delivering, one day of receiving and one day in the lab. We’re also requiring all nursing homes to test all members of their staff at least weekly.
Donald Trump: (26:13)
By unleashing America’s scientific genius, we have delivered effective treatments. The case fatality rate for Americans over 70 has declined by about 85%. That’s a fantastic number. It’s declined, that’s case fatality. It’s declined by 85%. Europe has seen 40% more excess mortality than the United States compared to a non-pandemic year. So you hear the numbers and those numbers are very interesting, but that’s the way it is. We continue to urge all Americans to wash your hands, socially distance, wear a mask when necessary and when you can not distance and protect, very importantly, the vulnerable, protect people that are older and especially people that have problems with heart or diabetes or some other problem.
Donald Trump: (27:09)
Earlier today, very exciting news, very big news, all over the world that talking about it, all over the world, it was amazing. We finalized a historic peace agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. After half a century, Israel and the United Arab Emirates will fully normalize their diplomatic relations. Nobody thought this was something that could happen for a long time. This is the most important diplomatic breakthrough since the Egypt-Israel Peace Agreement was signed over 40 years ago. We have Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, here. Thank you David, for being here, we very much, you would agree that this was a big day for Israel and a big day for the world. Good. Thank you, David. You’ve been fantastic, too. Fantastic ambassador and representative of our country. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (28:05)
The deal that was reached today will enable Muslims to have far greater ability to visit many historic sites in Israel and to peacefully pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is very important to them, which they’ve wanted to have access to for many, many decades. This is a monumental step to forging ties of cooperation in the Middle East. And I think you’re going to have other countries come forward. I can tell you, we already do, and they want to make a deal. You could have peace in the Middle East. It’d be fantastic. Israel is also suspending settlements in the West Bank, which is a big deal, a bold step toward achieving peace. Israel and the United Arab Emirates have also agreed to immediately expand and accelerate scientific collaboration to develop effective treatments and vaccines to defeat the China virus. They both have been hit. Virtually every country has been hit, 188 countries, and to save lives in their region and in their world. So they are working very much on the vaccines also with us.
Donald Trump: (29:16)
And again, some very good news is going to take place with respect to that. Our unprecedented diplomatic engagements laid the groundwork for this historic peace agreement, which was just announced a little while ago today. We will not rest as we continue to work toward a world of greater harmony and prosperity for all. I want to thank Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Crown Prince Mohammad bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates, two fantastic people, for their vision and their leadership. And I look forward to hosting them at the White House very soon to formally sign the agreement. We’ll probably be doing it over the next, I would say three weeks and they’ll be coming…
Donald Trump: (30:03)
I would say three weeks, and they’ll be coming to Washington. So that was a tremendous day. That was a tremendous thing that happened and it’s a great sign. We have a lot of other interesting things going on with other nations also having to do with peace agreements and a lot of big news is coming over the next few weeks, and I’m sure you’ll be very impressed and more importantly it’s a great thing for our country, a great thing for the world. So thank you very much. Please go ahead.
Speaker 1: (30:33)
Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate it. I’m going to ask you about school aged kids and food. One of the real problems when you shut down the schools, these are kids on reduced and free lunch programs, they need these meals to make it through their day. And with districts shutting down school, what, if anything, can the federal government do to make sure that the kids still get decent meals as long as the schools are out?
Donald Trump: (30:58)
Well, you know we don’t want the schools shut down, we want the schools to open, and especially very young children, all children, all children, but especially very young children, handle it very well. So we want schools open. We don’t want to be in that position. We want schools open. We’ve made payment, and we would frankly, if the school isn’t going to open, we would much rather follow the child with the payment. Give the money to the child, meaning the parents of the child, and let the parents do what they have to do including bringing the child to another school. Because we’re finding that whether it’s parents or children, people want to get back to school. They want to have their life back.
Donald Trump: (31:38)
Some people say, they don’t want, the Democrats, don’t want schools open because that’s where you have a lot of polling booths and if you have a school closed you can’t very easily have polling booths at the school. And that’s becoming, I think, maybe we’ll be able to show that as fact, but that’s another thing that they’re doing to try and keep people away from the polls. So we have to look into that. But you’ve been reading about it, I’ve been reading about it, and I don’t like it. But we’d like to see the schools open then we don’t have that problem. Good question.
Speaker 2: (32:10)
Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (32:12)
Thank you, please.
Speaker 3: (32:13)
Mr. President. What’s your understanding of how long Israel will suspend it’s West Bank Annexation plan?
Donald Trump: (32:20)
What do you think? Tell me.
David: (32:25)
We’re putting all our eggs into the basket of peace. We have an agreement with the Emirates. We’re going to nail down all the details, embassies, overflights, commercial. Then we’re going to extrapolate that to the rest of the region. How long that takes, I can’t tell you. We’ve prioritized peace over the sovereignty movement, but it’s not off the table. It’s just something that will be deferred until we give peace every single chance.
Speaker 3: (32:51)
And what do you want the Palestinians to take away from this deal since they’re not really a party to it.
Donald Trump: (32:58)
But they are supported largely by some of the countries that we’re talking to and that have already signed, in the case of the one country, but others will be following. And I think the Palestinians will, without saying it necessarily yet, I think they very much want to be a part of what we’re doing. And I see ultimately the Palestinians, I see peace between Israel and the Palestinians. I see that happening. I think as these very big, powerful, wealthy countries come in, I think the Palestinians will follow quite naturally. Yeah, please.
Speaker 2: (33:43)
Do you believe that a deal could have been reached without Israel’s agreement to temporarily suspend annexation?
Donald Trump: (33:48)
Say it again. Could you make it louder?
Speaker 2: (33:49)
Do you believe that the deal could have been reached without Israel’s agreement to temporarily suspend annexation?
Donald Trump: (33:50)
What do you think about that, David? It’s interesting.
David: (33:52)
I think you can’t do both at the same time. So I think, again, prioritize peace. After peace is given every opportunity to turn into sovereignty. I don’t think the two could have been done at the same time.
Speaker 2: (34:11)
Have you asked Israel to permanently consider abandoning annexation?
David: (34:11)
No, this is a temporary process. There has been no requests.
Donald Trump: (34:11)
Please, Kaitlan.
Kaitlan: (34:11)
Thank you, Mr. President. This morning you said that you do not want to fund the U.S. Postal Service because Democrats are trying to expand voting by mail. So I’ve got two questions for you. One, are you threatening to veto any legislation that includes funding for the Post Office?
Donald Trump: (34:30)
No, not at all. No.
Kaitlan: (34:32)
So you would sign something that does include funding?
Donald Trump: (34:34)
Sure. If they’re a separate thing I would do it. But one of the reasons the Post Office needs that much money is to have all of these millions of ballots coming in from nowhere and nobody knows from where and where they’re going. You saw what happened, Kaitlan in Virginia. It was 500,000 applications coming in going all over the state, nobody even knows where they came from. You saw what happened in New York, which was a disaster with Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. It was a basic disaster. And you see Patterson, New Jersey, what’s going on there, and we can give you many other locations and sites. What has happened is that’s part of a big negotiation. That’s actually a small part of a big negotiation to get more money to people that it wasn’t their fault. It was China’s fault, and Post Office is part of it.
Donald Trump: (35:22)
Another part of it is they want three and a half billion dollars just for the ballots themselves. Why it’s so much, I don’t know, but that’s what the Democrats want. But if the bill isn’t going to get done, that would mean the Post Office isn’t going to get funded, and that would also mean that the three and a half billion dollars isn’t going to be taken care of. So I don’t know how you could possibly use these ballots, these mail-in ballots. Absentee ballots by the way are fine. But the universal mail-ins that are just sent all over the place where people can grab them and grab stacks of them and sign them and do whatever you want, that’s the thing we’re against.
Kaitlan: (35:56)
But isn’t that precisely the problem, is that you’re saying you do not want to give this Post Office funding in this coronavirus legislation. They say they need it so they can be prepared so if the pandemic is still going on in November when the election happens and people don’t feel safe to go vote in person they can vote by mail and it can be safe and it can be secure.
Donald Trump: (36:15)
I can understand the Post Office, and if we could agree to a bill, the overall bill, which is obviously a much bigger number than just the Post Office, that would be fine. But they have the Post Office as one of their requests. It’s their requests.
Kaitlan: (36:28)
Right, but this morning you said you were against it, didn’t you?
Donald Trump: (36:31)
I’m only against, what I’m against is, I’m against doing anything where the people aren’t taken care of and the people aren’t being taken care of properly. We want people to get money. It wasn’t their fault that they got shut down. They got shut down by China. So whether it’s the Post Office or whether it’s a three and a half billion dollars, they’re asking for three and a half billion dollars just for the universal mail-in ballots. But they’re not willing to make a deal. These are two points within a very big deal. The thing they want more than anything else, Kaitlan, And you know this, is bailout money for the states and for the cities that are in trouble, which for the most part are Democrat run states and cities. So New York has a problem, California has a problem, Illinois has a tremendous problem, and others. They want to be able to bail out these states and we don’t want to be doing that or certainly don’t want to do it to the extent. They’re looking for $1 trillion. We don’t want to be doing that. Please go ahead.
Kaitlan: (37:30)
I’m just really confused because this morning you said they need that money in order to make the Post Office work so it can take all these millions and millions of ballots. And you said that would be fraudulent. So it sounded like you said [crosstalk 00:37:40]
Donald Trump: (37:40)
No, no, no. I said it will end up being fraudulent because if you look at what’s happened over the last few weeks, just look at the few instances where this has happened, it’s turned out to be fraud. Well, if you look at New York, it was fraudulent. If you look at Patterson, New Jersey, it was fraudulent. Of course there is. The whole thing is a mess. In fact, Carolyn Maloney’s opponent, he’s gone crazed. He said they took the election away from him, and he may be right. I think they should redo that election. And if you look at Virginia, it’s terrible. Look at some of the things that have happened in California. Look at California, where they found a million non-eligible voters. That was done by Judicial Watch, Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch. We have to have an honest selection, and if it’s not going to be an honest election, I guess people have to sit down and think really long and hard about it.
Donald Trump: (38:32)
But if they’re not going to approve a bill and the Post Office therefore won’t have the money, and if they’re not going to approve a big bill, a bigger bill, and they’re not going to have the three and a half billion dollars for the universal mail-in votes, how can you have those votes? What it would mean is the people will have to go to the polls and vote like the old days, like two years ago, three years ago, four years ago. They have to go. It doesn’t say anybody’s taking their vote away, but it means that the universal mail-ins don’t work. Absentees do work. It’s a very different thing. An absentee where you make an application and you send it in. They send you a vote. It’s different. So, Kaitlan, I’m not saying anything wrong with voting, I want them to vote, but that would mean that they’d have to go to a voting booth like they used to and vote.
Kaitlan: (39:22)
Even if they don’t feel safe voting in person? People want to vote by mail because [crosstalk 00:09:26].
Donald Trump: (39:26)
Well, they’re going to have to feel safe and they will be safe and we will make sure that they’re safe and we’re not going to have to spend three and a half billion dollars to do it. And when you go to a voting, it would be wonderful if we had voting ID and some states have that and some states don’t because they can’t get it passed. Most states want it. But we want people to vote, but we want people to vote so when they vote it means one vote. It doesn’t mean ballots all over the place. You saw what was happening in Virginia where piles of ballot applications are dropped all over the state. They had them named after dogs. They had them named after dead people. We want to have an accurate vote. I’m not doing this for any reason. Maybe the other turns out to be my advantage. I don’t know. I can’t tell you that. But I do know this, I just want an accurate vote. And it’s a fair question, by the way. So does everybody else. Yeah, in the back.
Speaker 4: (40:20)
Mr. President, how does the accord today between Israel and the UAE help struggling and persecuted Christians in the Middle East?
Donald Trump: (40:29)
Help what?
Speaker 4: (40:30)
How does it help struggling and persecuted Christians in the Middle East, the deal today?
Donald Trump: (40:33)
Well, I think it’s going to. I think it’s a big start, and you’re right about that. Christians have been persecuted by some countries in particular in the Middle East and I think this is a big start. It’s going to be a very strong start, very powerful start, and it’s something that I will tell you. I’ve told David and I’ve told every one of our negotiators, if you look at the way Christians have been treated in some countries, it’s beyond disgraceful. If I had information and if I had absolute proof, some of the stories that we’ve heard, which are not easy, which is not easy to get, I would go in and do a number to those countries like you wouldn’t believe, what they do to Christians in the Middle East. And it’s disgraceful. It’s disgraceful, you’re right. It’s a very big part of the overall negotiation. And as countries come in, for instance, UAE has agreed very strongly to represent us. I think they will very well with respect to Christianity.
Donald Trump: (41:35)
Because in the Middle East, it’s not treated well. It’s not treated well at all. It was treated horribly and very unfairly and it’s criminal what’s happened, and that’s for many, many years. I think it’s a great question and it’s a very unfair situation. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 5: (41:51)
Thank you, Mr. President. Larry Kudlow said that there is a routine check-in call with China on the phase one trade deal. My question is, what if they bring up Tik Tok and also WeChat? Would you instruct your team to engage them on that executive order you just signed?
Donald Trump: (42:07)
We have a deadline of September 15th, and whether it’s Microsoft, I understand, and others are negotiating. We also said that obviously it’s worthless if we don’t allow them into the country. So we said that the United States Treasury is going to be getting something out of this deal, something very substantial. But what we want is total security. But we have a deadline of September 15th. So I know Microsoft and others are very interested in it, but that’s our deadline. And it has to be proven to be totally secure. We don’t want to have any information going into China with what we’ve been through. And I have to tell you, you talked about the deal, you mentioned the phase one deal, well, the phase one deal, it’s a very interesting situation because you’ve been hearing the largest order of corn in history, the largest order of soy beans, the largest order of beef, they’ve done more than they’ve ever done so you’re going to have to figure that one out.
Donald Trump: (43:05)
With where I’m coming from, because they see my attitude, my attitude toward China is not friendly, but they have gone into orders that are extremely large, extremely large. And our farmers are very happy. But with what they did with respect to the pandemic, the plague that came in from China, it just is a different feeling. It was an incredible deal, but I have a very different feeling. But they are giving the Midwest, our farmers, among the largest orders they’ve ever seen. Somebody told me today, Bob Lighthizer said that it’s about 40% of what they’re selling now is going to China. So maybe they’re trying to make me change my mind a little bit because you know my attitude on China and it hasn’t been very good.
Speaker 5: (44:03)
[inaudible 00:14:04].
Donald Trump: (44:04)
Well, we’re not talking to them. No, we’re talking to the companies. There is a company but it’s a company within China, that means China, and the deal will have to be substantially beneficial to the United States and we need total security. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 6: (44:18)
Yes, Mr. President. Can you say whether you yourself think that annexation should be off the table for Israel? And if so, have you communicated that?
Donald Trump: (44:31)
No, not off the table. No. It’s something they’ve discussed, but Israel has agreed not to do that. I mean, more than just off the table, they’ve agreed not to do it. And I think that was very important and I think it was a great concession by Israel and I think it was a very smart concession by Israel. But, David, do you have anything further to add on that?
Speaker 6: (44:50)
The Prime Minister was pretty clear today at his own press conference that he considers this to be a temporary suspension and that the deal would still be open to him at some point in the future. I’m asking what you think he should do.
Speaker 6: (45:03)
… to him at some point in the future. I’m asking what you think he should do? Should he actually cut it off? [Crosstalk 00:45:05].
Donald Trump: (45:04)
No, right now all I can say, it’s off the table. So I can’t talk about sometime into the future. That’s a big statement. But right now it’s off the table. Is that a correct statement, Mr. Ambassador?
David: (45:14)
Yes. The word suspend was chosen carefully by all the parties. Suspended by definition, look it up, means temporary halt. It’s off the table now, but it’s not off the table permanently.
Donald Trump: (45:24)
Go ahead.
Kaitlan: (45:24)
Mr. President, thank you so much. Just to follow on some of the questions that Caitlin was asking. You said you do want an accurate vote.
Donald Trump: (45:24)
That’s right.
Kaitlan: (45:33)
Would you direct the Postmaster General to reverse some of the policy changes that have occurred there in order to prevent delays?
Donald Trump: (45:40)
No, not at all. No, I wouldn’t do that at all. No. I want the post office to run properly, which makes sense. They would need a lot more money if they’re going to be taking in tens of millions of ballots that just come out of the sky from nowhere. And so they need additional financial help. It’s a part of the bill that the Democrats don’t want to make because they want a much bigger part of the bill, they want a trillion dollars to go to states that are run by governors who happen to be Democrats who have not done a good job for many, many years.
Donald Trump: (46:10)
And those are states that owe a lot of money, and need a lot of money. They’re talking about $1 trillion. So the post office and the $3.5 billions for the votes themselves. Which sounds like a lot of money they’re looking for. $3.5 billion. Think of that; $3.5 billion to have mail in ballots. Again, absentee good. Universal mail-in, very bad.
Donald Trump: (46:36)
Please, go.
Kaitlan: (46:36)
One quick follow up. Given that the negotiations are still ongoing about whether to get more money to the postal service, why not put more resources and more money yourself, find a way to do that? To make sure there is a free and fair election.
Donald Trump: (46:49)
Well, they can do it very easily. All they have to do is make a deal. If they make a deal, the postal service is taken care of, the money they need for the mail in ballots would be taken care of, if we agreed to it. That doesn’t mean we’re going to agree to it.
Donald Trump: (47:01)
But all they have to do is make a deal. But again, more important to them is not that. That’s a lot of money, but its small time compared to the other. What they want to do, and very, very strongly what they want to do, is bail out cities that are run by Democrats and have been for many years. And these cities and states have done very badly, and they desperately need money for that. And we’re open to something, but we’re not open to the kind of money that they need. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 7: (47:27)
Mr. President-
Donald Trump: (47:27)
Just one second, please.
Kaitlan: (47:28)
Mr. President, very quickly, my question for you, which is-
Donald Trump: (47:30)
Just one second, please. Go ahead.
Kaitlan: (47:33)
What are you doing as president to make sure there is a free and fair election?
Donald Trump: (47:35)
That there what?
Kaitlan: (47:36)
What are you doing as president to make sure there is a free and fair election?
Donald Trump: (47:39)
So everyone talks about Russia, Russia, Russia. They talk about China, China. They talk about all of these different countries that come in and run our elections, which is false. But what they don’t talk about are things like very loose mail-in ballots, universal in nature, that frankly, Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, all of these countries that we are reading about, hearing about, and in some cases they’re writing about intelligence wise. These countries can grab those ballots or print forgeries of those ballots, and they would go out and they would have a field day.
Donald Trump: (48:22)
This is the easiest way for… The mail-in ballots is the easiest way for a country like China, or a Russia, or a North Korea, or Iran… I hear Iran, too. That was part of the report. This would be very easy for them. This is much easier than… Well we have been very strong.
Donald Trump: (48:41)
Now, if you remember, president Obama was informed about Russia by the FBI in September, the election was in November. President Obama decided to do absolutely nothing about it. People don’t mention that very much anymore. That’s a lost fact. But he was informed very powerfully that they’re going to do, and president Obama did nothing. We have done a lot and we’ve really shored it up.
Donald Trump: (49:05)
But what people can never prepare for are millions and millions of mail-in ballots because they can be forged. They can be captured. They can be taken.
Kaitlan: (49:16)
There’s no evidence of that.
Donald Trump: (49:16)
Well, that’s a very hard thing to do. We have to make sure that we can do that. Please.
Speaker 7: (49:21)
Mr. President, after three and a half years, do you regret at all, all the lying you’ve done to the American people? On everything.
Donald Trump: (49:26)
All the what?
Speaker 7: (49:27)
All the lying. All the dishonesties.
Donald Trump: (49:29)
That who has done?
Speaker 7: (49:31)
You have done? 10s of thousands [crosstalk 00:49:35]-
Donald Trump: (49:35)
Yeah, go ahead, please. Please. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Speaker 8: (49:39)
I wanted to ask you about the payroll tax-
Donald Trump: (49:41)
Go ahead.
Speaker 8: (49:42)
Cut. One, is it going to be optional or mandatory for employers to defer and not collect the payroll tax? [crosstalk 00:49:51] I have a follow up on that.
Donald Trump: (49:53)
The payroll tax is very important and a very big benefit to people as you know. To companies, because we want the companies to be strong, but now directly to people. And it’s a very big number, and we’re taking care of it. And this will go directly to the people, the workers, within the company. It’s a payroll tax.
Donald Trump: (50:12)
It’s called a payroll tax cut. We’re cutting the payroll tax, and it’s a very large number. And that will go directly to the workers of the company.
Speaker 8: (50:21)
Employers collect through FICA, are they going to be required not to collect that money?
Donald Trump: (50:29)
You mean later on? You mean later on at a later date?
Speaker 8: (50:31)
Right now. September one, when I get my paycheck, will [crosstalk 00:50:36]-
Donald Trump: (50:35)
The employers will collect it and give it, most likely. The employers will collect it and give it. Okay? Please. Go ahead.
Speaker 9: (50:44)
Mr. President, I have two questions. The first one on domestic politics. There are claims-
Donald Trump: (50:47)
Can’t understand a word you’re saying.
Speaker 9: (50:50)
There are claims circulating in social media that Kamala Harris is not eligible to run for Vice President because she was an anchor baby, I quote. Do you, or can you definitively say whether or not Kamala Harris is eligible, or meets the legal requirements to run as Vice President?
Donald Trump: (51:07)
I heard it today that she doesn’t meet the requirements. And by the way, the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. I have no idea if that’s right. I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for Vice President. But that’s a very serious… You’re you’re saying that they’re saying that she doesn’t qualify because she wasn’t born in this country.
Speaker 9: (51:33)
No, she was born in this country, but her parents did not… The claims say that her parents did not receive their permanent residence at that time.
Donald Trump: (51:39)
Yeah. I don’t know about it. I just heard about it. I’ll take a look. Back in the back, please.
Speaker 9: (51:43)
Mr. President, a follow up on UNGA Ambassador Kelly Craft recently said that she’s hoping that you might be able to deliver the speech in front of the UN general assembly in person, even though other leaders will be sending in their video recordings. Can you confirm that?
Donald Trump: (52:00)
Yeah. I’m thinking about going directly to the UN to do the speech. A lot of people will not because of COVID, will not be able to be there, as you’d know. But I think it’s appropriate. If we can do it, I’ll do it directly. And again, this will not be like in the past because some countries won’t be able to escape the problems they’re having.
Donald Trump: (52:23)
Countries that are having a tremendous problem with the China virus. So we’ll see what happens, but I would prefer doing it. I can do it the other way. I can do it viral as they say, I can do it in that form, but I’d rather be at the United Nations, deliver it. I think it better represents the country. Also, I feel sort of at least a semi obligation as the President of the United States to be at the United Nations to deliver what will be an important speech.
Speaker 9: (52:53)
[crosstalk 00:52:53] if the room was empty?
Donald Trump: (52:55)
Well, the room won’t be empty. The room will have different people there and representatives of countries, but I can understand how it’s very difficult for countries to be there. They won’t be there only for that reason. They’d love to be there. I’ve already had people call. In fact, say a couple of them, “I’d love to be there. If you want, I’ll be there.”
Donald Trump: (53:13)
I said, “Don’t be there. You don’t have to be there.” No, the room would be a… I think the room will not be. Although there may be a spacing requirement like you have in this room. This room was always packed. This room would be packed again if we had the seats open, but you have a spacing requirement. So I understand that the United nations, they may have that too.
Donald Trump: (53:32)
Yes, please.
Speaker 10: (53:33)
Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question on the [inaudible 00:53:36] if you don’t mind, could I defer my question to [inaudible 00:00:53:39] from Epoch Times?
Donald Trump: (53:41)
Sure. Yes, please. Please.
Speaker 11: (53:42)
Thank you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (53:42)
Thank.
Speaker 11: (53:45)
I would like to ask her opinion about what recently happened in Hong Kong, recent attack on press freedom in Hong Kong and Jimmy Lai was arrested. His newsroom was raided. How will the US respond to this?
Donald Trump: (53:59)
Well, I think it’s a terrible thing, but one thing that we have done, we gave tremendous incentives to Hong Kong; because of freedom. We want freedom. And we were giving tremendous economic incentives to Hong Kong. And we have now withdrawn all of those incentives. And it will be impossible for Hong Kong to compete with the United States, with respect to that, it just won’t be. Because we’ve taken all of the incentives away.
Donald Trump: (54:25)
If you look at China with the World Trade Organization, as an example, they’re getting tremendous because they’re considered a developing nation, which is ridiculous. Why should they be a developing nation? But we’re not. And they get tremendous incentives. We have, by the way, told them it’s unacceptable. And we’ve been doing that for a long time. They understand exactly how we feel, and big changes are being made. But with respect to Hong Kong, they get tremendous financial incentives so that they could do business and compete in the world.
Donald Trump: (54:55)
We’ve now withdrawn all of those incentives. It’s going to be very hard for Hong Kong to compete. And I will tell you that the United States, and I say this from any standpoint you want to hear it, will end up making a lot more money because of it. Because we lost a lot of business to Hong Kong. We made it very convenient for people to go there, for companies to go there. We’ve withdrawn all of that. And the United States will be a big beneficiary from an economic standpoint, but I hate to see what happened to Hong Kong because freedom is a great thing.
Donald Trump: (55:24)
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Aug 11, 2020","7, 2020
7:34 P.M. EDT","President Donald Trump: (00:00)
Nice to be with you all. Good evening. Before providing today’s update on the China virus. I want to address the violence, looting and rioting taking place in the Democrat controlled cities of New York, Portland, Chicago, and Seattle. The mayors and governors of these states and cities have an absolute duty to use all resources necessary to end the violence and all of the injury and death.
President Donald Trump: (00:32)
New York City has an army of great police. I know them very well and the law enforcement and the New York’s finest are as good as it gets, and they should be allowed to do their job. If they do the job, if they’re allowed to do their job, the New York City problem will be solved and be solved quickly. They do it well. The mayor, Bill de Blasio should immediately hire back all of the police who were fired. Without justification, they were fired.
President Donald Trump: (01:06)
I guess that’s part of defund the police by the Democrats. They should hire New York City’s finest back. You have some incredible policemen doing specific jobs that nobody else can do actually when it comes to terrorism and other things. Together, the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have 25,000 police officers, sheriffs and guardsmen available to quell any violence. They can do it very quickly, very easily if allowed to do their jobs. Again, if allowed to do their jobs.
President Donald Trump: (01:39)
Our police, our law enforcement is incredible, but they have to be allowed to do the jobs, the Democrats, or the radical left Democrats who are both because they’re becoming one and the same. If you look at election results, the Democrats are being taken over by the radical left. The city of Portland and the state of Oregon have 10,000 fine officers and guardsmen available. Seattle, Washington, and Washington State have 10,000 available.
President Donald Trump: (02:08)
So Seattle, city of Seattle and Washington State itself, they have great people. They have to be allowed to do their job. I’m urging them to deploy these resources, to protect their citizens and to stop the violence and all of the things that we watch on television going on. Although, a lot of the unfortunately fake news don’t like to put it on, because it shows that the Democrats are doing a very bad job of law enforcement. They have to put it on. They have to be honest with the people of this country.
President Donald Trump: (02:41)
But I’m offering all available federal support requested to stop the violence and arrest the criminals. We have to be asked by the governors or the mayors, and we’ll be there very rapidly. It’s ready, willing, and able. We’re all ready, willing, and able to go to these jurisdictions and take care of them. We’ll do them very quickly. You saw what happened in Minneapolis. They ripped the city apart.
President Donald Trump: (03:06)
When the National Guard went in, it ended immediately. It was immediate and lasted. These acts of destruction are not isolated incidents, but demonstrate the pattern of violent left-wing extremism that you get to see if you’re watching the right news program. Under any rational definition, the arson attack on the police precinct in Portland would be considered an act of left-wing domestic terrorism. They really are anarchists these are left-wing anarchists. They are anarchists and I’m directing the Department of Justice to stop these anarchists immediately to stop them and to work with the city and the state to get the job done.
President Donald Trump: (04:01)
Local authorities have to investigate and prosecute all of these crimes immediately. We’ll work with you and the local authorities know who they are. They know where they come from. They know a lot about them. They ought to get their act together and get it done, and we’re ready to help. If you need that help, you shouldn’t need that help actually, you should be able to do it yourselves and get it done very well. Again, you have excellent police and law enforcement, but you have to let them do their job.
President Donald Trump: (04:34)
What you’re seeing in Portland, in Seattle, New York, Chicago is really the Democrat roadmap for America. They want every city in America to resemble Portland in a form. They want to pass federal legislation, gutting and hamstringing every police department in America. They want to get rid of your second amendment. They want to end cash bail, close prisons, defund police departments, or at least largely defund. You see that with New York, a billion dollars they took out of their police department and crime has gone through the roof. And appoint far-left prosecutors who side with the criminals and target law-abiding citizens. If the left gains power, no city town or suburb in our country will be safe.
President Donald Trump: (05:26)
On the vaccine front, some very good news. Today I met with the leaders of Operation Warp Speed, our historic undertaking to produce a safe and effective vaccine in record time. We heard an update from the top scientist in the government and the leaders of pharmaceutical companies, which right now aren’t too thrilled with me. They’re taking millions of dollars worth of ads because I’ve created a favored nation status for drugs, which is going to reduce drug prices by 40, 50, 60, and maybe even 70% in some cases.
President Donald Trump: (06:02)
Numbers that have never been heard of a thought of. So when you see those ads, remember that means your drug prices are coming down. And when you see ads attacking your president, it’s very simple. That means drug prices are going to be falling very soon. This evening, I’m pleased to announce that we have reached an agreement with Moderna to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine candidate. The federal government will own these vaccine doses. We’re buying them.
President Donald Trump: (06:34)
Recently. We also secured partnerships with Johnson & Johnson, as well as Sanofi and GSK to support the large scale manufacturing of their vaccines. Doing very well in those vaccines. Tremendous promise in every single one of them and we have many of them. And they’re years ahead of schedule. This would have been if it were in the previous administration or any of the previous administrations, where we are now would have taken years. Three vaccine candidates are now in phase three trials already. The final stage of clinical trials. This is the final stage.
President Donald Trump: (07:11)
We are investing in the development and manufacture of the top six vaccine candidates to ensure a rapid delivery. The military is ready to go. They’re ready to deliver a vaccine to Americans as soon as one is fully approved by the FDA. And we’re moving very close to that approval. We’re on track to rapidly produce 100 million doses as soon as the vaccine is approved and up to 500 million shortly thereafter. So we’ll have 600 million doses.
President Donald Trump: (07:45)
Operation Warp Speed is the largest and most advanced operation of its kind anywhere in the world and anywhere in history. We’ve treated more than 86,000 Americans with convalescent plasma. A recent Mayo Clinic study found that this treatment may produce results, which are incredible. We look to a reduction and reduce mortality rate by 50% and possibly even more than 50%. I urge Americans who have recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov and sign up and donate. We would really appreciate that because it’s been very successful, unbelievably successful, and we would love you to go and donate.
President Donald Trump: (08:36)
As we continue to confront the global pandemic, the United States economy is rebounding with strength like nobody thought possible. You’ve seen the numbers. You see what’s going on yesterday, today and tomorrow. In my opinion, we’re very poised for a great third quarter and very poised for some great stock market numbers and 401k numbers, and everything else. Today, the Dow Jones passed 28,000 points for the first time. More than a 50% surge since just March. So we’ve increased by 50% more than since just March.
President Donald Trump: (09:13)
It has gained approximately 9,500 points, that same period March and has recovered nearly all of its value since the virus struck our nation. Think of that. America’s economy is incredible and its economic recovery is outpacing our peer nations. Last quarter, the European Union’s GDP decline was nearly 40% worse than the United States. So it’s 40% worse than the United States. We’ve built such a strong base that we’re able to do things and sustain better than anybody in the world by far.
President Donald Trump: (09:53)
France’s GDP decline was nearly 80% worse than ours and Spain experienced an economic contraction twice as severe as the United States. Nationwide, we continue to see improvements in our fight against the pandemic. Very substantial improvements. Since last week, 87% of the counties in the United States report decline in cases. Think of that. 87% of the counties in the United States, they reported decline in cases. Mortality has declined by 7% and hospitalizations are declining rapidly.
President Donald Trump: (10:31)
States that were primary hotspots, such as Florida, Texas, and Arizona have reduced cases by nearly 25%, but all Americans must remain vigilant practice good hygiene, socially distance, wear a mask whenever possible. Whenever you are getting too close to people, wear a mask and protect the elderly. Always protect the elderly. Since the end of July, the seven-day average for cases in the United States has fallen by nearly 20%, but the virus continues to increase in nations across the globe. Last week, France and Germany both recorded their highest daily number of new cases in three months.
President Donald Trump: (11:19)
Not that I want to bring that up, but might as well explain it to the media. The seven-day case average for Germany has increased by 62% since last week, unfortunately, and that is truly unfortunate. Its increased 82% in France, 113% in Spain and 30% in the United Kingdom. Those are big increases. Cases are also rapidly increasing in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Switzerland, Slovakia, Estonia, and other European countries.
President Donald Trump: (11:56)
And in our country, they’re going down. We will be seeing that even more rapidly as time goes by in short time. Even though America has the largest at-risk population, including 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times that of other European countries. Europe has experienced a nearly 40% higher excess mortality rate than the United States. We also have fewer deaths per capita, excluding the disastrous deaths from the New York Tri-state area, which had a very, very hard time and did better than our peer nations of Western Europe. Thanks to our excellent and highly advanced medical care and skill.
President Donald Trump: (12:42)
Something that the news doesn’t tell you. They don’t tell you that. They don’t like to tell you that. The United States has now conducted more than 66 million tests, far more than any other nation in the world. India, which has a population of 1.5 billion people has done 24 million. So we’re at 66 million and think of that. India is at 24 million and India’s second. The entire region of Latin America comprising 33 countries has conducted 25 million tests. Yet, Latin America has more confirmed cases by far than the United States.
President Donald Trump: (13:22)
As we safely restore a great economy and reopen our schools and hopefully we can watch colleges play football. We want to get football in colleges. These are young, strong people. They won’t have a big problem with the China virus. So we want to see college football start and hopefully a lot of great people are going to be out there. They’re going to be out there playing football and they’ll be able to fight it off, and hopefully it won’t bother them one bit. Most of them will never get it statistically, but we know we’ll see more cases at some point and we will eventually develop sufficient immunity in addition to everything else that we’re doing.
President Donald Trump: (14:12)
So college football, get out there and play football. People want to see it and stand for your American flag, stand for your national anthem. Because people are not happy when that doesn’t happen. You look at the NBA and what’s happening with the NBA and their poor ratings. I don’t know. I can’t imagine why, but they didn’t stand, they didn’t show respect to our flag. They didn’t show respect to our national anthem. And maybe that’s having an impact, but just not good. The NFL had its problems two years ago when that happened, they went way down in their ratings and their fans and they struggled back.
President Donald Trump: (14:50)
And now all of a sudden they’re putting themselves in the same position. So stand for your flag and stand for the national anthem. And I think you’re going to do fantastically well. Because a lot of people aren’t going to watch if you don’t, I’m one of them. That’s why our strategy and attention are focused on preventing the cases that are most likely to require discussing the opening of schools, hospitalization, or produce any death.
President Donald Trump: (15:21)
We have to maintain vigilance over our elderly population. We’ve learned that I think more than any single event, Scott. We have to be very vigilant all over, but we have to really protect our elderly population and especially our elderly population that has problems with heart, lung, any form of sickness, diabetes in particular. And we are at the same time in very good shape with respect to hospital room and hospital overcrowding. We’re in great shape.
President Donald Trump: (16:01)
On the nursing home front, protecting our nursing home residents is a critical focus of our strategy. HHS recently announced that they will use the Provider Relief Fund to deliver an additional $5 billion to further protect nursing homes and long-term care facilities. As they continue to combat the China virus. We have delivered over 1,800 rapid point-of-care testing devices to nursing homes. And we were in the process of delivering these devices to all 15,000 Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes by the end of September. So they’re going to have very, very rapid tests. They won’t have to wait around two or three days or four days. And that number has come down very substantially compared to what it was when you send it to the labs. You get very accurate tests, but it takes a period of time to send it, to check it and then to send it back.
President Donald Trump: (16:58)
But we are now at a position where we’re sending very, very rapid tests, five minutes to 15 minutes. We will care for America’s seniors as we develop the vaccine and therapeutics and therapeutics are coming along very, very well. We think we have some great answers on therapeutics and you’ll be hearing that about them in the very near future. I’m very much into the world of therapeutics, where you go into the hospital and you give a shot or you do what you have to do with perhaps transfusion, and it’s combinations of what you can do and people get better. I like that very much. I like that very, very much.
President Donald Trump: (17:40)
And that could even proceed in getting it. That will, I think probably even proceed vaccines. But therapeutically, we’re doing very, very well. A lot of people are going to be very happy when they see some of the numbers that I’m seeing and some of the results. So tremendous things are happening on the vaccine front, at the therapeutic front. And our country should be very proud of itself. We’re going to get it delivered very rapidly as soon as it comes out. Okay. Questions please.
Speaker 2: (18:17)
Thank you, Mr. President. 20 million people are due to be evicted from their homes next month. But do you fear that this be your Herbert Hoover moment if you do not reach a deal with Congress to set up a new CARES Act?
President Donald Trump: (18:31)
So we are not allowing that to happen. We’re stopping evictions. We are stopping evictions. We’re not going to let that happen. We’re not going to evict people. We’re not going to let people, the Democrats, maybe they don’t care, but I care. And we signed an executive order. You know that, right? And we are not letting people be evicted. Please
Speaker 3: (18:53)
Thank you. Thank you, President Trump. I could have two questions. I’d like to ask you one about Senator Harris’ record and then a different one about FISA abuse.
President Donald Trump: (19:01)
Sure.
Speaker 3: (19:02)
So regarding Senator Harris’ record, you had a pretty quick response to that. You had an ad out that said that she was a phony and I wanted to drill down.
President Donald Trump: (19:11)
That she was a what?
Speaker 3: (19:12)
A phony. And I wanted to ask about a specific example that a lot of people thought was a phony moment. As San Francisco DA, she oversaw according to the Mercury News, 1900 marijuana convictions. But she was asked in an interview last year if she had smoked marijuana and she appeared to joke and according to some people lied and say that she was listening to Snoop Dogg and 2Pac. While their music hadn’t come out at the time while she said she was smoking pot listening to it. Why would she lie about that? Do you see that as more evidence that has surpassed a marijuana liability?
President Donald Trump: (19:46)
Well, she lied. I mean, she said things that were untrue. She is a person that’s told many, many stories that weren’t true. She’s very big into raising taxes. She wants to slash funds for our military at a level that nobody can even believe. She is against fracking. She’s against petroleum products. I mean, how do you do that and go into Pennsylvania or Ohio or Oklahoma or the great state of Texas? She’s against fracking. Fracking’s a big deal.
President Donald Trump: (20:25)
She’s in favor of socialized medicine, where you’re going to lose your doctors. You’re going to lose your plan. She wants to take your healthcare plans away from 180 million Americans. 180 million Americans that are very happy with their health insurance and she wants to take that away. So she was my number one pick. I mean, as they would say, because hopefully you’ll start college football. She was my number one draft pick. And we’ll see how she works out. She did very, very poorly in the primaries as you know. She was expected to do well. She ended up at right around 2% and spent a lot of money.
President Donald Trump: (21:13)
She had a lot of things happening. And so I was a little surprised that he picked her. I’ve been watching her for a long time. And I was a little surprised. She was extraordinarily nasty to Kavanaugh, Judge Kavanaugh then, now Justice Kavanaugh. She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing, the way she was. The way she treated, now Justice Kavanaugh. And I won’t forget that soon. So she did very poorly in the primaries and now she’s chosen. So let’s see how that all works out.
Speaker 3: (21:43)
Supporters of marijuana legalization vote for you rather than her, because she convicted so many people in the past?
President Donald Trump: (21:49)
I can’t tell you what she’s voting for. I don’t think she knows what. I think Joe knows even less than she does, but I was only surprised at the pick. A lot of people would say that might be the pick. I was more surprised than anything else because she did so poorly. Many people did much better than her in the primary. She did very poorly in the primaries and that’s like a poll. That’s like a poll.
Speaker 3: (22:09)
Can I also ask you about FISA abuse, President Trump?
President Donald Trump: (22:13)
Go ahead.
Speaker 3: (22:13)
Yes, about FISA abuse. So now it’s widely accepted among the Republicans, there was FISA abuse.
President Donald Trump: (22:19)
Tremendous FISA abuse.
Speaker 3: (22:20)
The justice department IG has found that with Carter Page application. But we were actually warned in 2013 that the surveillance court was allegedly a rubber stamp, was approving surveillance. And I was wondering, I don’t think as president you’ve commented on Edward Snowden, but do you think he should be allowed to return without going to prison?
President Donald Trump: (22:39)
So as far as FISA abuse is concerned, there was tremendous FISA abuse. It’s amazing that it’s taken this long. And everyone knows that it’s been proven very substantially. Not only FISA abuse, changing documents and putting documents in front of the FISA court in courts that are disgraceful that they could have done it. And the fact is we caught Joe Biden, President Obama, the whole group. You can look at Brennan, Comey and Clapper, the whole group. We caught then spying on our campaign.
President Donald Trump: (23:14)
This was an illegal act like no other illegal act. This was treason. This was at the highest level of treason and Obama and Biden got caught spying on my campaign using intelligence agencies of the United States government to do it, both before and after the election. So before the election, then after I won, they continued. It’s totally illegal activity and now we just have to see happening.
President Donald Trump: (23:45)
But as far as Kamala is concerned, she’s a big tax raiser. She’s a big slasher of funds for our military. And she’s got a lot of difficult things that she’s going to have to explain. Plus she was very, very nasty too. One of the reasons it surprised me, she was probably nastier than even Pocahontas to Joe Biden. She was very disrespectful to Joe Biden and it’s hard to pick somebody that’s that disrespectful. When she said things during the debates, during the Democrat primary debates that were horrible about Sleepy Joe. And I would think that he wouldn’t have picked. OAN please.
Speaker 4: (24:31)
Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday, Seattle City Council voted to cut funding for their police department and the police chief there Carmen Best, the first black woman to serve in that capacity, she resigned hours later. What does this say about our country? What does this say about the defund the police movement?
President Donald Trump: (24:54)
Well, I think that Seattle in spite of all that they’ve been through with the embarrassment of having a radical left group, Antifa and others take over a big portion of the city of Seattle. We’re talking about a big city, a major city that they allowed that to happen is incredible. That it took so long to fix is incredible. The only reason they went in is because they knew we were going in the following day. And so they preceded us. They didn’t that to happen. They didn’t want to be embarrassed and the people just gave up. They were exhausted from having taken over a city for so long.
President Donald Trump: (25:32)
The police commissioner seems like a very good woman. They were going to slash her salary by 40 or 50%. And they cut a tremendous amount off the police department. Really where people are saying it’s not sustainable as a good police department. And again, those police are good also, but they’re not allowed to do their job. So I think it’s a shame. I hate to see her go because she did in her own way, a very good job. But she wasn’t effective in convincing the mayor and the city council to give the funds that were needed or just leave the funds the way they are.
President Donald Trump: (26:08)
They’ve done a big defund, a big part of it. And it’ll probably get worse before people realize this is a tragic era before people start dying and getting hurt very badly. So I think Seattle’s made a tragic mistake. I think Portland has no clue as to what they’re doing, they have no clue. And hopefully they’ll be asking for help because we can solve their problem very, very quickly. Yeah. Go ahead.
Speaker 5: (26:36)
Mr. President, two quick questions. One on Senator Harris. Very simply, is she going to help former Vice President Biden’s chance in November or is she going to hurt?
President Donald Trump: (26:48)
Well, I like Vice President Mike Pence much better. He is solid as a rock. He’s been a fantastic vice president. He’s done everything you can do. He’s respected by every religious group, whether it’s evangelical, whether it’s any other group, they respect Mike Pence. He’s been a great vice president and I will take him over Kamala. And the horrible way she, again, treated Justice Kavanaugh. That was a horrible event. I thought it was terrible for her. I thought it was terrible for our nation. I thought she was the meanest, the most horrible, most disrespectful of anybody in the U.S. Senate.
President Donald Trump: (27:33)
She’s also known from what I understand as being just about the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate. And I would’ve thought that Biden would have tried to stay away from that a little bit because with what they are doing with open borders and sanctuary cities where they’re trying to protect sanctuary cities, which is also protecting large number of criminals. With all of the things that they’re doing, second amendment, they want to take away your second amendment or modify it to a point where it’s essentially no longer the second amendment. I would’ve thought he would’ve gone a different way. Thank you very much, everybody.
Speaker 6: (28:13)
Mr. President, Russian developed a vaccine. [crosstalk 00:28:15].
Speaker 7: (28:16)
Mr. President, why did you donate to Kamala Harris then?
Speaker 8: (28:18)
$6000 dollars to her."
"Aug 10, 2020",Uknown,"President Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much. Sorry for that. there was a shooting outside of the White House and seems to be very well under control. I’d like to thank the Secret Service for doing their always quick and very effective work, but there was an actual shooting and somebody has been taken to the hospital. I don’t know the condition of the person. It seems that the person was shot by Secret Service so we’ll see what happens … And yeah. Did you have something? Go ahead.
Speaker 1: (00:41)
Do you have the details about the shooting? Were they targeting-
President Trump: (00:44)
No, there were no details. We just found out just now. It was outside of the White House, this area right over here. And they’ll have details for you in a little while. Somebody is taken to the hospital. It seems that the shooting was done by law enforcement at that person, at the suspect. It was the suspect who was shot. And this just took place. A couple of people outside. I noticed a man named John Roberts, who you know very well. He reported that he heard shots. He was outside and he heard two shots.
Speaker 2: (01:17)
Mr. President-
Speaker 1: (01:17)
Mr. President, I had heard-
Speaker 2: (01:18)
Was this a threat towards you, sir?
President Trump: (01:20)
We don’t know yet. We don’t know. They’re going to find it.
Speaker 1: (01:22)
Do you know if the individual said anything, sir, mentioned your name, anything like that?
President Trump: (01:26)
We don’t know that yet. No. We don’t know that yet.
Speaker 1: (01:28)
And you can confirm it was the Secret Service that did shoot this suspect?
President Trump: (01:30)
It seems to be, yeah.
Speaker 1: (01:31)
It seems to be.
President Trump: (01:32)
It seems to be.
Speaker 2: (01:32)
Where were you taken, Mr. President? Were you taken to the bunker?
President Trump: (01:34)
No, we were taken just out over to the Oval Office.
Speaker 4: (01:37)
What did the Secret Service tell you when you were outside of the room?
President Trump: (01:40)
Just told me … When he came up, you pretty much saw it like I did. He said, “Sir, could you please come with me?” So you were surprised. I was surprised also. I think it’s probably pretty unusual, but very, very professional people that do a fantastic job as you know. So it seems to me, it seems to be, from what I was said, there was a shooting. It was a law enforcement, shot someone, seems to be the suspect. And the suspect is now on the way to the hospital. I can’t tell you the condition of the suspect.
Speaker 3: (02:11)
Was the suspect armed, Mr. President?
President Trump: (02:12)
There was nobody else injured. There was no other law enforcement injured. And we’ll get onto the press conference, but I do want to thank Secret Service. They are fantastic. The job they do.
Speaker 3: (02:23)
Was the suspect armed? Do you know? Was he armed?
President Trump: (02:27)
From what I understand, the answer is yes.
Speaker 3: (02:29)
He was armed, Mr. President?
President Trump: (02:32)
That’s what I understand. I don’t know. You’ll have to ask them.
Speaker 5: (02:33)
Do you know what kind of weapon? What type of weapon?
President Trump: (02:36)
I don’t know that, no.
Speaker 5: (02:36)
Was it a male or a female suspect?
President Trump: (02:36)
I don’t know. You’ll have to get … They’ll have a detailed, maybe a briefing for you outside later.
Speaker 2: (02:44)
Did they say anything against you personally, Mr. President?
President Trump: (02:46)
I don’t know. I didn’t ask that question. It might not have had anything to do with me. It might’ve been something else, but it was on the outside of the premises, the wall, as you know, the fencing, especially the new fencing they put up is very powerful, but it was on the outside of the White House. Okay? And they’ll have a full report, Secret Service. In a little while, we’ll have a full report.q
Speaker 3: (03:10)
Are you rattled by this at all, Mr. President?
President Trump: (03:10)
I don’t know. Do I seem rattled? It’s unfortunate that this is a world, but the world’s always been a dangerous place. It’s not something that’s unique. The world has been … You look back over the centuries. The world has been a dangerous place, very dangerous place, and it will continue, I guess, for a period of time.
Speaker 1: (03:33)
Does this make you think differently about your personal safety inside the White House?
President Trump: (03:37)
No, I feel very safe with Secret Service. They’re fantastic people. They’re the best of the best and they’re highly trained. I don’t know if anybody got to walk outside, but there were a lot of terrific looking people ready to go if something was necessary, people at the highest level of law enforcement. There’s nobody like these people. So they just wanted me to step aside for a little while just to make sure that everything was cleared outside because it was right in this area.
Speaker 3: (04:11)
Why did you come back, Mr. President? Why did you decide after that … Because obviously it created a lot of commotion. What made you decide to come back and continue the briefing?
President Trump: (04:18)
Well, I didn’t even think about not coming back. I said, “Am I able to go back?” And they said, “You’d have to wait a little while.” I waited a little while, as you know, in the Oval Office area. And I said, “Can I get back now?” And they said, “Yes.” And they have a lot of fortification outside just in case, but it was one person. Okay?
Speaker 2: (04:38)
You said the shooting was outside. How far away from was it?
President Trump: (04:41)
They’re going to be giving you a full briefing in a little while.
Speaker 2: (04:44)
Was it pretty far from the White House, or was it right in front of the White House?
President Trump: (04:46)
I can only tell you they’re going to give you a briefing. It was outside of the premises. Near the fence, but outside of the premises.
Speaker 2: (04:53)
But it was near the fence. So pretty close to here.
President Trump: (04:55)
Yeah, pretty close. So I was telling you that the Dow Jones and the S&P 500 are now 50% above the March level. NASDAQ is setting new records. It’s already broken the record despite the situation of having the China virus. We have new jobs are rising and unemployment is falling faster than nearly anyone thought. And over the past three months, we’ve created over 9 million jobs and that’s a record, a three months record. If you added it up, it’s a three month record by far. And we’ve beaten expectations by 12 million. We’re 12 million above expectations, which is pretty remarkable.
President Trump: (05:43)
Today we had great reports on new job openings and there’s clearly a housing boom, which has been incredible numbers in both housing and an automobile boom. We’ve rarely seen anything it and it’s going on right now in America. Inventories are at rock bottom, used car sales are at record levels, and we will have rebuilt … We’re doing a rebuilding like nobody’s ever seen. It’s a big plus for manufacturing and construction, so construction’s getting close to record territory. Manufacturing is doing very well. The car companies are doing great. Very happy for Michigan, the state of Michigan. We have a lot of car companies moving in. A lot of plants are being built and expanded in Michigan and Ohio. There is no reason why the economy can’t grow at a 20% pace in the third quarter. That would be a record.
President Trump: (06:40)
And interestingly, it will be a number that’s going to be announced before November 3rd. It gets announced probably around November 1st, which is very interesting. But it’s going to grow at a very substantial pace based on all of the numbers we’re looking at and probably a lot more substantial than we originally thought. We’re creating new incentives for working jobs. We’re also providing much needed assistance to those who are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic contraction. And the contraction is now while we have the pandemic, we have a lot of great things happening in terms of the vaccines and therapeutics, as you know. And I think we’ll be making tremendous progress over the next period of a few months and certainly before the end of the year. I think we’ll have a vaccine before the end of the year, very substantially. And we may have a therapeutic resolvement very quickly. Very, very quickly.
President Trump: (07:39)
And frankly, that’s the one I’d rather have faster because you’d go in, you’d give a transfusion or a shot to people that are very ill, and they’d be able to come out of the hospital the next day or a few days later. If the states participate in our core sharing unemployment plan, we are going to be doing something very, very interesting with all of the things that we announced on Saturday. I don’t have to repeat what they are, you know very well. And we’ve had some tremendous success already. If you look at what’s happening with the stock market and people are very thrilled at what we’re doing, we’d like to get the Democrats to focus on other than what they’re focusing on, which is a bailout of poorly running states.
President Trump: (08:25)
We have many great running states, States that are setting records. And let’s see what happens with respect to that. But we’re looking at also considering a capital gains tax cut, which would create a lot more jobs. So we’re looking very seriously at a capital gains tax cut and also at an income tax cut for middle income families. We’re looking at expanding the tax cuts we’ve already done, but specifically for middle income families. And you’ll be hearing about that in the upcoming few weeks. And I think it’ll be very exciting. So a capital gains tax is going to be a lot of people put to work and it would be a cut in the capital gains tax and also a cut in the middle income income tax.
President Trump: (09:19)
So I now want to just discuss a little quick brief, and then we’ll take a few more questions. But we took some. Who would have known we were going to take questions before we started? Is that right, Jennifer? But that’s the way it happens sometimes. We want to discuss, if we might, the China virus and the world continues its fight against this horrible plague. Countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases. We have a rapid increase only in cases where … It’s very interesting because we’re so far ahead of testing, we have more cases. If we had much smaller testing, would have fewer, but we feel that having testing is a very important thing. It’s a great record to have. In many ways we’ve tested, I guess, close to 65 million people right now. And nobody’s even close to that number. No other country is close.
President Trump: (10:16)
India would be second at 11 million and they have 1.5 billion people. So we have the number one testing anywhere in the world by far. And we also have, I think, the highest quality tests. We have a lot of different ones, but we have the highest quality including the short term and the lab tests. The lab tests take a little bit longer. And Dr. Burks was telling me a little while ago that we’re down to two days and two and a half days on getting your result on the lab tests. The other ones, you get them in five minutes to 15 minutes. So that’s exciting. But countries in every continent are seeing increases in cases in recent days. Cases have rapidly increased in Japan and Australia, unfortunately, and they’re now experiencing higher peaks than they did in March. To the south of a border, of our border, cases have continued to surge in Mexico, Central America, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and throughout Latin America.
President Trump: (11:15)
It’s really the hotspot. It’s posing a major challenge for this continent. Latin America is now the region with the most number of confirmed cases by far despite a relative scarcity of testing. So when you think of that, that means it’s pretty much on fire, having a hard time. We’re helping them. We’re sending them tremendous numbers of ventilators, which we’re making by the thousands every month. And we’re helping Latin America very much. It’s hard for them to come into the country because we have big sections of wall up now. The new wall is being built, which people don’t talk about. They used to talk about nothing but the wall. Now that it’s being built, they’re not talking about it so much, but it’s helped us because we’re up to almost … We’re getting close to 280 miles, 280 miles in the most important areas.
President Trump: (12:08)
So that’s helping us a lot in terms of not having people come in to the country who are infected with the coronavirus. This global trend underscores the persistence of the virus, including the nations that apply the strictest and most punishing lockdowns. You have nations that are really tough on the lockdowns and they’re getting hit very hard. That’s why my administration is pursuing a science-based approach that protects the most vulnerable, preserves hospital capacity, and focuses on the delivery and development of treatments and ultimately the vaccine. I feel strongly that we will have a vaccine by the end of the year and it’ll be put in service maybe even as we get it because we’re all set militarily. We’re using our military to distribute the vaccine and logistically-
President Trump: (13:03)
… to distribute the vaccine and logistically there’s nobody like this group of people. I meet with them a lot and they’re ready to go. Soon as they have it, they’ll be going. But more importantly, the therapeutics, as I said, I think the therapeutics could be great. Initially speaking, I think that would be if I had my choice, but you’re going to have them both. You’re going to have a boat. You’re going to have them both very soon, too.
President Trump: (13:24)
At the same time, we urge all Americans to apply common sense mitigation. You all know what that mitigation is. Everybody knows it by heart now. Nearly half of all of the deaths from the China virus in the United States have occurred in nursing homes and longterm care facilities. That’s why we have delivered funding, equipment and rapid testing to our nation’s nursing homes to protect those at high risk. We’re very focused on nursing homes and senior citizens’ areas. Anywhere that we have senior citizens, we’re very, very focused. We’ve delivered over 1,800 rapid point of care testing devices, those are very quick, and shipped over 700,000 tests to nursing homes. Nursing homes are being protected like never before.
President Trump: (14:13)
The United States faces a unique range of challenges that requires our constant vigilance. America has the largest at risk population of any developed country by far, 1.5 million residents of nursing homes, about five times out of the United Kingdom and other European countries. Our country also has a higher prevalence of underlying conditions that this virus targets. Yet we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other peer nations in Western Europe. So that’s an important, we have fewer deaths per capita than the United Kingdom and most other nations in Western Europe and heading for even stronger numbers.
President Trump: (14:56)
But one person is too much as far as I’m concerned. Should have never been allowed to happen. Should have never been allowed to escape China. Nationwide we continue to see encouraging signs. In the last seven days, nationwide cases declined by 14%. Hospitalizations decreased by 7%. Fatalities decreased by 9%. Arizona and Florida are improving rapidly with fewer patients coming to emergency rooms by far as well as decreasing cases, decreasing fatalities, and expanded hospital capacity. So we have an expanded hospital capacity. It’s pretty dramatic when you look at it, meaning we have more room, should we need it. So a lot of tremendous work has been done.
President Trump: (15:45)
In Texas, likewise, the number of patients going to emergency rooms has dropped from July by more than two thirds. That’s a lot. Nevertheless, we continue to monitor Texas very closely. Terrific governor, terrific people working on that whole situation in Texas, especially at its test positivity rate, which rose over 20% this weekend. Overall cases in Texas are coming down and have stabilized in the border counties. That’s again where you have the wall and you’re next to, in some cases the wall, in some cases you’ll have it very shortly. You’ll have it all built within a number of months. But those areas were hit very hard. And they’re likely cases from Mexico that come in, back and forth from the border. They come in illegally.
President Trump: (16:40)
As doctors have found more effective ways to treat patients, the fatality rate continues to improve. Texas has one sixth the vitality rate of New York and New Jersey that they had in April. And if you look at New York and New Jersey, they work very, very hard, but very heavy density. And they had a lot of different kinds of difficulty. The fatality rates in Florida and Arizona are between 25% and 33% of the peak rates of New York and New Jersey. Again, different climate, a different grouping, a different density, tremendously different density.
President Trump: (17:19)
In California the situation is starting to stabilize and improve throughout the major metropolitan areas. Statewide hospitalizations continue to decline very substantially with about 20% fewer inpatients now than on July 21st. California starting to really show signs of correcting. We’re monitoring regions with increasing cases including Boston, Chicago, and the Midwest. And we’re monitoring them very, very strongly and very, very hard. I do want to say that I think at the end of a fairly short period of time, you’re going to be in very, very good shape all over our country. Every loss of life is tragic and all nations must work together to defeat this horrible virus. My administration is going to continue to save as many lives as possible. We are working around the clock. Everybody, it’s incredible how hard they’re working and people from other countries, we’re working with them also and they’re working very hard.
President Trump: (18:23)
This is something that’s now attacked 188 different countries. There are a wide range of factors that determine how the virus impacts a nation such as age, underlying conditions. Underlying conditions is a very big one to you. If you’re sick in any way, if you’re, especially they say heart and diabetes, that’s not a good thing to have if you’re going to have this, if you’re going to catch it. So we’re trying to protect especially those people that have problems with their heart or diabetes and levels of preexisting immunity resulting from past exposure to other viruses which happens. We must stop politicizing the virus and instead be united in our condemnation of how this virus came to America, how this virus came to the world and we’re going to figure it out and we’re going to find out and we’re very angry about it.
President Trump: (19:25)
On the therapeutics and vaccine updates, three vaccine candidates are currently in phase three clinical trial, something that would have been impossible under the previous administration or any other administration. And several others are showing considerable promise. We have great companies, very well known companies. I think everyone in this room would know these companies, but they’re the biggest and the best in the world. And we’re working with other foreign companies and countries that have been really working very closely with us. We’re trading, we’re not looking to do anything but come up with the answer and we really don’t, we don’t care. We want to come up with the answer. If it’s one of ours or one of theirs, it’s okay. We have to come up with the answer and we’re very close to getting it. Some people think we have it. We may have it. We have the best scientists in the world racing to develop a safe vaccine that will end this pandemic, save millions of lives and that’s millions of lives all over the world and then the harm inflicted by this virus to our society and to all other nations.
President Trump: (20:36)
Last week, the NIH began a clinical trial of remdesivir paired with another approved antiviral drug and anti-inflammatory drug. You know that remdesivir has been very successful. And now they’re experimenting with others, including antivirals and antiinflammatories, and they’re having some very interesting success. We’ve secured enough remdesivir to treat over 650,000 patients. On Saturday I took executive action in a signing to save American jobs and support American workers. I signed directives to give a payroll tax holiday with the understanding that after the election, on the assumption that it would be victorious for an administration that’s done a great job, we will be ending that tax, will be terminating that tax. On the other hand, the other group wants to raise taxes and they may want to leave it where you pay it. But the payroll tax is a big deal for people. It’s a tremendous saving for people and we’re going to be doing it. And we intend to terminate it at the end of the appropriate period of time.
President Trump: (21:53)
It’s for those making less than $100,000 through the end of 2020, to provide an extra $400 per week also in unemployment benefits and to extend the freeze on home evictions. We want to extend the freeze so people aren’t evicted. It’s not their fault that the virus came from China. It’s China’s fault and to suspend payments on student loans through the end of the year and then beyond. And again, they’re paying interest on loans and they’re not allowed to go to their college. So we’re going to suspend payments on student loans through the end of the year, and then another extension most likely, because it’s not fair to the students to have to pay when the colleges aren’t doing the job of getting open. And I think probably many of them could be open. So I want to thank you all. I’m sorry for the disturbance before. Things happen and if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. Yeah.
Speaker 6: (22:53)
Thank you, Mr. President, I appreciate it. [Kaylee 00:22:55] said earlier today that you’ve been working around the clock, so there’s no delay to get these enhancement unemployment payments to Americans. Can you give me your timetable? Are we talking next week, two weeks, a month?
President Trump: (23:07)
Steve, what do you think?
Steve: (23:08)
Within the next week or two the states will be able to execute.
Speaker 6: (23:11)
So Mr. Secretary, you’re saying when?
Steve: (23:14)
I think within the next week or two, most of the states will be able to execute.
Speaker 6: (23:20)
Got it. And most of the states-
President Trump: (23:20)
By the way, the gentleman you know everybody, you know Russell, you know. But this is Scott Atlas. You know that, right? Scott is a very famous man who’s also very highly respected, Stanford. And he’s working with us and will be working with us on the coronavirus. And he has many great ideas and he thinks what we’ve done is really good. And now we’ll take it to a new level. And so it’s great to have Scott working along with us and we appreciate it very much, Scott. Thank you very much really [inaudible 00:10:52]. We’ve had some great discussions.
Speaker 6: (23:58)
To follow up on that, Mr. President, if you don’t mind, you mentioned the states. Have all the governors signed on to this?
President Trump: (24:01)
We just had a meeting with the governors and they were very anxious to get money for the people in their states. And if they, depending on the state, we have the right to do what we want to do. We can terminate the 25% or we don’t have to do that. So we’ll see what it is. It depends on the individual state, but a lot of money will be going to a lot of people very quickly. And I’ve instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to move as quickly as he can, right? So we’ll get it done. Yeah, please.
Speaker 7: (24:32)
I have a question about the coronavirus, but I wanted to just ask you to be clear on the incident outside. There’s a fairly significant perimeter around the White House. Does it concern you at all that someone who is armed was able to get so close that you needed to be removed from the briefing room?
President Trump: (24:47)
Well, I don’t know if he was closer or not, he or she. I don’t know if it was a he or she, but I have such confidence in these people. They’re so good. And I don’t think the person breached anything. He was on the outside ground. So I don’t believe anything was breached. I asked that question. So they were relatively far away.
Speaker 7: (25:09)
[inaudible 00:25:09] on coronavirus. 97,000 children tested positive for coronavirus in the last two weeks in July according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Does that give you any pause about schools reopening for in-person learning?
President Trump: (25:23)
No, because they may have, as you would call it a case and maybe a case, but it’s also a case where there’s a tiny, it’s a tiny fraction of death, tiny fraction, and they get better very quickly. Yeah, they may have it for a short period of time. But as you know, the seriousness of it in terms of what it leads to is extraordinarily small, very, very much less than one percent. Jonathan.
Speaker 7: (25:52)
Do you still believe that children are essentially immune?
President Trump: (25:56)
Yeah. I think that for the most part, they do very well. I mean, they don’t get very sick. They don’t catch it easily. They don’t get very sick.
President Trump: (26:03)
… don’t get very sick. They don’t catch it easily. They don’t get very sick. And according to the people that I’ve spoken to, they don’t transport it or transfer it to other people, or certainly not very easily. So yeah, I think schools have to open. We want to get our economy going. We have incredible numbers despite this. If we could get this going, I think it’s a very important thing for the economy to get the schools going. Jonathan, go ahead.
Jonathan: (26:27)
Thank you, Mr. President. In Ohio, a few days ago, you said, and I’ll quote, “Joe Biden has hurt God, he’s against God.” The Vice President has said that he’s a man of deep Catholic faith, that he’s credited for helping him endure some immense personal tragedy. So what did you mean by that when you say that Joe Biden has hurt God or is against God?
President Trump: (26:44)
Well, if you look at the manifesto that they’ve come up with, and if you look at their stance on religion and things having to do very importantly with aspects of religion and faith, I don’t think a man of deep religion would be agreeing to the Bernie Sanders plan. You take a look at what they have in, and you can’t put that into the realm of a religious group of people. I will say that. And I think it’s one of the reasons why, if you look at polls, which I’m not a big believer in polls. If I was, I guess I wouldn’t be standing here right now. And by the way, our poll numbers are going up very rapidly, as you know. And Joe’s are going down very rapidly. He’ll have to come out of the basement, it looks like pretty soon. Because it’s one of those things.
President Trump: (27:34)
But no, if you look at the manifesto. I call it the manifesto, a lot of people are calling it the manifesto. My opinion is further left than where Bernie was before. So normally he’d be left and you’d bring it somewhere a little bit toward the center. But some of the things that they have down there, and I’m not only talking in terms of religion, I’m not talking even in terms of religion. But some of the things they have in the agreement made, and this wasn’t agreement made by Bernie Sanders and Joe, it’s a terrible thing. It would be a terrible thing for our country. It will destroy our country. We will go into a depression. We will put on regulation. We will double and triple taxes. It will be terrible for healthcare. Just terrible. You’ll have 180 million people lose their healthcare. It will be a terrible, terrible thing for our country. Okay. Yeah, please. Yeah.
Speaker 8: (28:27)
Thank you, sir. I’d like to ask you a question about something you said in Bedminster as well. You said that you’re planning to issue an executive order to ensure that health insurance companies prevent or cover people with preexisting conditions. And you said that had never been done before, but that’s not the case, because that is the law under the Affordable Care Act. So my question is, why do you need to issue an executive [crosstalk 00:28:49] order for a law that is already existing?
President Trump: (28:51)
But I didn’t say that. I said as an executive order. As you said, I said as an executive order it hasn’t been done before. We want to be able to assure people that preexisting condition is always taken care of. As you know, we’ve done tremendous things having to do with the individual mandate. We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare. Which really ended Obamacare as it would be officially known, because the individual mandate was the biggest part. It was also the most unpopular part, where you pay for a terrible privilege of overpaying for insurance. You pay not to have to pay for your healthcare. And that was a disaster for people, and very unpopular.
President Trump: (29:34)
That was called the individual mandate. And we terminated that. And officially terminated that. And that was something that we have been given thanks for it by many, many people. But the individual mandate will always be with us, the individual mandate termination will always be, they can’t start it up. In fact, I don’t even believe, you’ll have to tell me, I don’t believe it’s been challenged when we ended it. And preexisting conditions, the Republicans are 100% there. And I’ll be issuing, at some point in the not too distant future, a very strong statement on that. Probably in the form of an executive order.
Speaker 8: (30:12)
But why do you need, sir, to do an executive order if it’s already a part of-
President Trump: (30:16)
Just a double safety net, and just to let people know that the Republicans are totally strongly in favor of taking care of people with preexisting conditions. It’s a signal to people. It’s a second platform. We have preexisting conditions will be taken care of 100% by Republicans and the Republican party. I actually think it’s a very important statement. Yes, please.
Speaker 9: (30:46)
Mr. President, do you still intend to try to hold an in-person G7 meeting in the United States at some point in August and September? Had you already sent out invitations to do so?
President Trump: (30:56)
No, we haven’t sent out invitations. We’re talking to them. As you know, I was on the phone with many of them yesterday with respect to Lebanon, which is truly one of the saddest, most catastrophic things I’ve ever seen. And they have no idea how many people have died. They’re having revolution right now in that country. It’s just a terrible thing. But I was, yesterday, eight o’clock in the morning our time, we had a big teleconference call. Some of those people were there. I’m much more inclined to do it sometime after the election, we were going to do it in September. They’d like to do it. We could do it through teleconference or we could do it through a meeting. But I am now suggesting, I told my people yesterday actually, why don’t we do it sometime after the election when things are a little bit … you have a little more time to think about it? Because it’s very important. [crosstalk 00:31:50] The G7 is very important.
Speaker 9: (31:51)
… President Putin to that meeting?
President Trump: (31:54)
I don’t know, but we have invited a number of people to the meeting. I certainly would invite him to the meeting, I think he’s an important factor. But we will invite certain people that aren’t in the G7. Some people have already accepted, but we’re going to be doing it after the election. I think it’s a better atmosphere to have a G7. I think it’s just a better, calmer atmosphere to have a G7. Yeah, please.
Speaker 10: (32:20)
Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask [inaudible 00:32:22] actually. Have you spoken to any Democrats since Friday? Have they reached out to you at all about restarting negotiations?
Speaker 11: (32:32)
I’ve spoken to several Democrats, I have not spoken to Schumer or Pelosi since then.
Speaker 10: (32:37)
Would you reach out at all to them to [inaudible 00:32:38]-
Speaker 11: (32:40)
Yes. At a time they want to meet and they’re willing to negotiate and have a new proposal, we’re more than happy to meet.
President Trump: (32:45)
They’re hurting people very badly. This would have been so easy for them to do. And I saw that Senator Schumer said today on a show, I don’t know what show, but he said today on a show that we should meet, we should do something. But where has he been for, how many weeks have you been negotiating? Like four? And they should do something. It would have been so much easier than doing it the way we did it. But we did something that’s very important. And frankly, it’s been well received, very well received. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 12: (33:15)
Thank you, Mr. President. You tweeted earlier today that you’re considering Gettysburg as a venue for your speech, for the RNC nomination acceptance. What’s your thinking behind that as a possible location?
President Trump: (33:26)
Well I’ve been to Gettysburg numerous times. It’s a national park. It’s a national historic site. It’s incredible. You know, it’s the history. It’s incredible actually, to me. It was a very important place, and is a very important place in our country. So we’re looking at that, and we’re looking at the White House. The White House would be very much easier for secret service. You see what just went on here, they’re all here. Just like you have your seats, they have their seats at the White House. So there wouldn’t be any expense or any extraordinary expense. And the White House would be a lovely place to do it also. Least expensive place that you could do it would be at the White House. This is a government expense. And look, I watch also with governments, I watch to make sure that we do what’s right. But we’re looking at Gettysburg and we’re looking at the White House. And we have other sites too, but I think these would be two really beautiful sets. Jennifer.
Speaker 12: (34:27)
Would you envision having an audience for that speech?
President Trump: (34:31)
You could. You have plenty of room at both locations. I see John Roberts. John, you were outside, you said you heard shots fired before.
John Roberts: (34:39)
Two shots in rapid succession just after you [inaudible 00:34:41].
President Trump: (34:43)
And there were shots pretty much.
John Roberts: (34:44)
Certainly-
President Trump: (34:45)
You definitely know the difference. I know that.
John Roberts: (34:47)
Sorry?
President Trump: (34:48)
You know the difference. You thought they were shots, John?
John Roberts: (34:51)
It definitely sounded like gunfire.
President Trump: (34:52)
I saw your report inside, when I went inside. It was a good report too. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Jennifer, please.
Jennifer: (34:59)
Thank you, sir. Can you give us an update on China? Do you think that your administration will respond to the sanctions that China announced this morning on American officials?
President Trump: (35:08)
Well we’ve already responded in many different ways. We’re talking a lot about China. We shouldn’t have been talking about China. We did a phase one deal and it was a wonderful deal. And all of a sudden it means very little in the overall import of things. They should have never allowed what happened to the world, including us. But this was released into Europe and it was released into the US, and it was released all throughout the world. But it wasn’t released into China. And we were doing numbers that just were incredible. And we hope to be able to do them, perhaps even next year. I think we’re going to have an incredible year next year, but that will never pay for the loss of life in our country and all over the world. So we view China differently than we did eight months ago. Very much [crosstalk 00:36:00] differently. Yes, please.
Jennifer: (36:02)
Is there still any consideration of delisting Chinese companies? Is that an ongoing discussion?
Speaker 11: (36:07)
Delisting?
Jennifer: (36:09)
Delisting Chinese companies?
Speaker 11: (36:11)
We never comment on specific things. But no, there’s nothing [crosstalk 00:36:13]-
Jennifer: (36:17)
Could it still be on the table?
Speaker 11: (36:17)
Again, nothing specifically at the moment [inaudible 00:10:18]. Are you talking about delisting [crosstalk 00:36:20] on the exchange?
Jennifer: (36:21)
Yes.
Speaker 11: (36:22)
Oh, I’m sorry. Yeah. So just to be clear, we did make the recommendation. And the SEC will be putting out… Yes, as of the end of next year if they do not fully comply, and that’s Chinese companies, any other companies, they all have to comply with the same exact accounting or they will be delisted on the exchanges.
President Trump: (36:42)
[crosstalk 00:36:42] But also…
Speaker 11: (36:46)
I though you meant sanctions. I was confused when you said delisted.
President Trump: (36:46)
And Jennifer, we’re also talking on the WTO, the World Trade Organization. China’s treated much differently than we are. This should have been handled many years ago when it first happened, but they are treated as a nation that’s developing. And they’re treated as what they call a developing nation, which gives them tremendous incentives and advantages over and above what the United States gets. And over and above what other countries get also. This is a developing nation. I don’t think so. I don’t think for purposes of what we’re talking about it should be. And we are putting in, and we’ve already put in a request that China should no longer be declared a developing nation, that it have advantages over the US.
President Trump: (37:28)
And I told them that a year ago, and I told them that two years ago. And we put it in very powerfully that they should not have advantages over other countries, frankly. And they’re not going to have any more advantages over… This should have been done by numerous presidents a long time ago, because it gives them a tremendous boost over everybody else. And it’s a very unfair situation. No, we are upset with China because of what they did. China was not good. And China will be, if you look at what’s going to happen, whether it’s Iran, Iran will make a deal with us in a month after the election’s over if we win the election.
President Trump: (38:11)
But their greatest dream in the world is that Joe Biden wins, because they will own this country. China will own this country. North Korea will own this country. They will own our country. And they’re all waiting to see the election. And if we have a win on November 3rd, we will have a deal with, in my opinion, Iran within one month. And I don’t know that we want to have a deal with China, to be honest with you. So I’m saying it myself, gee, but China wants us to lose very badly. And you know who else is not happy with us winning? Russia. The phony people that tell the story, the fake news stories about Russia. It was just reported the numbers, I raised $400 million extra in NATO. You know that. It went from 130 to $400 billion, and that’s a year, in order to strengthen up NATO.
President Trump: (39:03)
That’s a year, in order to strengthen up NATO. Nobody says that. We became the biggest energy exporter. We are now… if you look at what we have, we’re energy independent. So many different things. Our military is stronger than it ever was. We spent $2.5 trillion on our military.
President Trump: (39:20)
I exposed the terrible deal between Germany and Russia on the pipeline. Nobody even knew about the pipeline. Nord Stream. Nord Stream, too. Nobody knew about it. Nobody talks about it. I said, “What’s this all about?” So we protect Germany from Russia and Germany pays Russia, billions of dollars a year for energy. And it’s a big portion of Germany’s energy. If I was a person that was a German citizen, I would not be happy with that deal, because they were at a very big disadvantage. So, no, Russia would not be happy.
President Trump: (39:53)
And I can tell you that China would not be happy at all. We’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars as your head of the treasury, Steve, right? We’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars from China. We never took 25 cents from China, never, not even 25 cents. And $28 billion we gave to our farmers because they were targeted by China. They were actually targeted and we gave $28 billion compliments of China to our great farmers and ranchers, because they were unfairly targeted by China in order to make a better deal with us. I said, “We’re not going to do that. We’re going to, instead of making a better deal, we’re going to tariff you at very high numbers, 25%, 10%, and actually numbers that could go up a lot.” And we had a lot of money left over after giving the 28 billion to the farmers and ranchers and some others, frankly, we had many, many billions of dollars leftover and we’re still receiving that money. Even though we made the deal, we’re still receiving that money.
President Trump: (40:56)
So if we win the election, we’ll have deals with a lot of countries, very fast. They’re just waiting to see who wins because they are hoping, they are hoping that Joe Biden wins. Sleepy Joe. And if he wins, you know what’s going to happen? China will own us. Our markets will crash. The 401ks will go down to practically nothing. Stocks will go down to practically nothing. Remember stocks, there’s these big companies, they’re owned by millions of people that are carpenters and policemen and farmers and lots of other people. And they are the ones that benefit by having a good stock market, probably more than anybody else. But the 401ks, the stocks, the economy will be in a shambles.
President Trump: (41:47)
They want to raise taxes. They want to triple taxes. They want to raise the corporate tax, but they want to raise all taxes. Ultimately, they can’t pay for what they want to do anyway. And what they’re going to do is destroy your health care and destroy so many other things. We’re going to have 180 million people that are so happy with their private health care. They’re going to lose it under this crazy plan that these people are proposing. You will have a crash like you’ve never seen before. And I’ve been very good at predicting these things. Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 13: (42:17)
Thank you, sir. You just mentioned the President Putin, possibility of inviting him because he’s important. You’re own Director of National Intelligence has said that Russia is currently planning or actually meddling in the election. Have you raised that directly with Putin ever?
President Trump: (42:32)
They said China, Russia, Iran, and probably others. But because of the fake news, they seem to think Russia plays the best.
Speaker 13: (42:41)
[crosstalk 00:42:41].
President Trump: (42:42)
So, what they do… it’s all right. Well, I’m just saying the way the politicians… look the other day, they said the three countries. They said China and Russia and Iran, and some reporter got up and said, “Russia is meddling.” I said, “Well, didn’t it mention China and Iran? Why didn’t you mention them too?” So, I don’t know. You know what I’m telling you?
President Trump: (43:01)
I’ll tell you who’s meddling in our elections. The Democrats are meddling by wanting and insisting on sending mail in ballots where there’s corruption all over the place. If you check what happened in New York, a small, relatively small race with Carolyn Maloney, and they called her the winner the other day, because I was mentioning it at conferences and getting a lot of action on that statement, so they called her… they declared her the winner and they have no idea who won. And the person, her opponent is very angry, but they had mail in voting and they had hundreds, and I think even thousands of ballots that are missing that were fraudulent. Take a look at the Carolyn Maloney race. Take a look at Patterson, New Jersey. Take a look now at this one in Virginia, where they mailed out 500,000 applications and they’re going to people that aren’t supposed to be getting an application. Yeah, please, go ahead.
Speaker 14: (43:58)
Thank you, sir. Secretary Pompeo is heading to Europe again-
President Trump: (44:00)
Right.
Speaker 14: (44:01)
… this week. Do you have any updates on when the travel restrictions for the EU are going to be listed? It seems strange we’re offering exemptions for professional athletes, but not to K-1 visa holders, the so called-
President Trump: (44:13)
We’re trying to do the best we can. You have big sporting events and that’s good for our economy. That’s good for us. And they do talk about certain exemptions and they make sure everyone’s perfectly tested and everyone comes in at 100%. But we do make certain accommodations because you do have star athletes, and that means a good thing for the country. That’s economic development, et cetera.
President Trump: (44:36)
But we are working very closely with Europe and with other countries to see what’s the best time. And don’t forget, I was the one that turned Europe off because they really… they led the way they let it much more so than we did. We were months following them. And in terms of they got hit earlier than we did, quite a bit earlier than we did. So I put the restrictions on Europe. I put the restrictions on China, which was a great thing to do in retrospect. We’re getting, I mean, that was a very important day. Dr. Fauci said that was one of the most important days. And a lot of people didn’t want me to do it, but we first put a ban on anybody from China coming in. And then we put a ban on Europe coming in, but we’re working very closely with Europe to see when that will all come off. Yeah, please.
Speaker 15: (45:21)
A press conference said that 160,000 people had died on President Obama’s watch. Do you think you would have called for his resignation?
President Trump: (45:31)
No, I wouldn’t have done that. I think it’s been amazing what we’ve been able to do. If we didn’t close up our country, we would have had 1.5 or 2 million people already dead. We’ve called it right now, we don’t have to close it. We understand the disease. Nobody understood it because nobody’s ever seen anything like this. The closest thing is in 1917, they say right. The great pandemic certainly was a terrible thing where they lost anywhere from 50 to 100 million people probably ended the Second World War. All the soldiers were sick. That was a terrible situation. And this is highly contagious. This one is highly, highly contagious.
President Trump: (46:17)
Now, if I would have listened to a lot of people, we would have kept it open. And by the way, we keep it open now all the way. We keep it open. But we would have kept it open and you could be up to 1.5 or 2 million people right now. 1.5 to 2 million people. Our people have done a fantastic jobs. Our consultants and our doctors, and with disagreements and with a lot of things happening. What we’ve done with ventilators has been amazing. What we’ve done with medical equipment has been incredible. We’ve supplied the governors, nobody, not one person in this country that needed a ventilator didn’t get it. And at the beginning there was a big shortage of ventilators. Nobody had stockpiles or anything comparable to what you had to have.
President Trump: (46:59)
So we would have lost… if you think about it, you had mentioned 160,000 people and multiply that times 10 right now. I think it would have been unsustainable and unacceptable, but that’s what would have happened. Had we kept it open. So, no, I think we’re a very large country. We are… one person, and I say it all the time, a lot of people like to leave that out, one person is too many. It should have never happened, but they’ve done a really, an extraordinary job. They’ll never be given the credit, and I’m not talking about me. The people that have worked on this so hard will never be given the credit, but they’ve done an extraordinary job with a very large, diverse country, really an extraordinary job. And a lot of the governors who, as you know, they sort of do the micro in their states and they go up. And I think I can tell you that a lot of the governors have done an extraordinary job too. Yeah, please go ahead. Thank you. Did
Speaker 16: (47:58)
Thank you. Did you ask the US Ambassador in Brazil to focus his efforts in eliminating ethanol tariffs in Brazil?
President Trump: (48:05)
You have to… you can’t. Yeah.
Speaker 16: (48:06)
Did you ask the ambassador in Brazil to focus his efforts to lower, to eliminate ethanol tariffs in Brazil?
President Trump: (48:13)
We haven’t really discussed that too much, but at some point we probably will be, and we don’t want people tariffing us. And if they tariff us, although I must tell you, I have a very good relationship with President Bolsonaro. He’s great. And I hear he’s doing well. He’s recovered from having COVID, having COVID-19 as they say, and that’s great and send him my regards.
President Trump: (48:36)
I think that as far as Brazil is concerned, if they do tariffs, we have to have an equalization of tariffs. And we are going to be presenting something having to do with tariffs and fairness and fair tariffs, because we have many countries for many years that have been charging us tariffs to do business, and we don’t charge them. And it’s called reciprocity. It’s called reciprocal tariffs. And you may be seeing something on that very soon. Did you have one [Orianne 00:00:49:04]?
Speaker 16: (49:07)
[crosstalk 00:49:07] Brazil and coronavirus, Mr. President?
President Trump: (49:07)
Orianne, please?
Speaker 17: (49:10)
Thank you, Mr. President, first of all, thank you for coming back to finish the briefing-
President Trump: (49:11)
Thank you very much.
Speaker 17: (49:12)
… after the scuffle. I have an opinion question for you. Joe Biden is set to announce his running mate at any time now. We expect him to announce her. Many of your supporters feel that the reason that Obama’s former NSA, Susan Rice is on the top of Biden’s list is that she can best cover up a lot of the Obamagate surveillance crimes that had taken place during your campaign. What are your thoughts? What is your opinion? Do you subscribe to that line of thought? How do you feel about it?
President Trump: (49:47)
Well, look, the Obama campaign spied on our campaign and they’ve been caught. All right. And now let’s see what happens to them, but they have been caught. They’ve been caught red handed. It’s probably treason. It’s a horrible thing they did. It probably never happened before, at least nobody got caught doing it. But they use the intelligence agencies of our country to spy on my campaign and they have been caught. And there are a lot of people involved. I don’t want to say how much she’s involved. Frankly, if he chooses her, that’s fine. But that’s a potential liability. We’ll see.
President Trump: (50:27)
But President Obama knew about it. Joe Biden knew about it. Comey knew about it. Brennan Clapper, the whole group, they all knew about it. Lisa Page, her lover, Strzok, they all knew about it. And we have it documented. We have it in texts. We have it in all sorts of forms. They knew about it. It was a terrible thing. Should have never happened and should never be allowed to happen again to a president. This should never happen again. This was a setup like we’ve never seen. I think it’s a political crime of the century and they’ve been caught. So let’s see what happens to them all. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Speaker 18: (51:11)
Mr. President."
"Aug 7, 2020",Uknown,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much, and it’s a great honor to have everybody here. I know the press was not quite expecting this, so I appreciate your being able to attend. We have a terrific number of things and some very positive things to tell you tonight.
Donald Trump: (00:23)
I want to begin by giving an update on the economy. Economic health is vital to public health, that’s why our strategy to kill the China virus is focused on protecting those at greatest risk, while allowing younger and healthy Americans to safely return to work and safely return to school. Very important.
Donald Trump: (00:45)
We added 1.8 million new jobs in July, exceeding predictions for the third month in a row, and adding a total of over 9.3 million jobs since May. And I will say that the job growth that we’ve seen over the last three months, 9.3 million, is the single greatest three-month period of job creation in American history. That’s big stuff. That’s big news and great news.
Donald Trump: (01:12)
Over the past three months, the United States has surpassed market expectations by a total of 12 million new jobs. Over the last three months, the United States has added 623,000 manufacturing jobs. Remember you’d need a magic wand to get manufacturing jobs. And we’re getting them even in a pandemic, which is disappearing. It’s going to disappear.
Donald Trump: (01:39)
And 639,000 brand new construction jobs. Over half of the new jobs are full time jobs, and wages are up by 4.8%, which is terrific. Unemployment has fallen by nearly 30% since April. Think of that. 30% since April. Hispanic American unemployment has decreased by nearly 32%. Jobs held by African Americans, which were hit especially hard by the shutdowns, incredibly hard, increased by nearly one million over the past three months, and that’s also a record. That’s a job record. African American, one million, it’s a job record.
Donald Trump: (02:22)
We must ensure that the progress continues. My administration has enacted over three trillion in historic relief since China allowed the virus to infect the world. So we’ve contributed $3 trillion.
Donald Trump: (02:38)
My administration continues to work in good faith to reach an agreement with democrats in Congress that will extend unemployment benefits, provide protections against evictions. A terrible thing happens with evictions. Not fair. It wasn’t their fault that we were infected with this disease from China, and get relief to American families.
Donald Trump: (03:01)
Yet tragically, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer continue to insist on radical left wing policies that have nothing to do with the China virus, nothing to do with it at all. So you have a virus that comes in and you have people in Congress that don’t want to help our people. If Democrats continue to hold this critical relief hostage, I will act under my authority as president to get Americans the relief they need.
Donald Trump: (03:34)
And what we’re talking about is deferring the payroll tax for a period of months ’til the end of the year, and I can extend it at a certain period. Hopefully I will be here to do the job. We’re going to do the job. We’ve been doing a job like nobody could, nobody would, actually. And so we’re going to have the payroll tax go ’til the end of the year, and it’ll be retroactive to July 1st. So we’re going to go back to July 1st and it’ll go to the end of the year, payroll tax. At the end of the year, it may be extended.
Donald Trump: (04:13)
We’re going to enhance unemployment benefits through the end of the year. So unemployment benefits will be… That’s a big one. Will be brought out to the end of the year, and defer student loan payments and forgive interest until further notice. So students who were paying student loans and in many cases, they’re not even allowed to go back into their colleges. Extend the eviction moratorium. We will be extending that, so people aren’t evicted. Not their fault.
Donald Trump: (04:50)
We had a lengthy discussion this morning with President Macron of France concerning numerous subjects, but in particular, the catastrophic event which took place in Beirut, Lebanon. Horrible, horrible event. At 3:00 PM this afternoon, I spoke with President Aoun of Lebanon to inform him that three large aircraft are on the way, and they’re fully loaded with medical supplies, food, water, and many other things. Lots of emergency equipment. Also, first responders, technicians, doctors and nurses are on their way. This was an event like the world has not seen for a long time. Horrible event.
Donald Trump: (05:41)
We’ll be having a conference call on Sunday with President Macron, leaders of Lebanon, and leaders from various parts of the world. Everyone wants to help. We spoke to a lot of people. They all want to help. The United States is with authorities on the ground right now in Lebanon to identify further health and humanitarian needs, and we will provide further assistance in the period to come. We’re working very closely with their government and with their leaders.
Donald Trump: (06:12)
And on behalf of the United States, I want to extend our condolences to all of the families. A much larger number of families than anybody would have thought, and that anybody at first thought. But all of those families who lost loved ones, relatives, friends in this horrible tragedy, we stand firmly with the people of Lebanon, and we’ll continue to offer our full support through this very difficult time. We have not seen anything like this in a long time.
Donald Trump: (06:45)
As you know, earlier this week, I met with American workers at the Tennessee Valley Authority, who had been laid off by the leadership at the Tennessee Valley Authority. As you know, this is a form of utility. It’s been around for a long time since FTR. And the head person not controlled by government, but it’s sort of, semi-public in a sense, gets paid the highest salary in the world of government.
Donald Trump: (07:22)
He gets $8 million a year. That’s not a bad amount of money. It’s $8 million a year. And we are not accepting that. Even though we’re not the ones that appoint him or her, but in this case him. We’re not accepting somebody getting paid $8 million a year. This has been going on for many years, and we will do something about that, and we’re already in negotiations right now, including possible termination.
Donald Trump: (07:54)
They and hundreds of their fellow American tech workers, the workers at the TVA were being terminated from their positions on top of all of this, and on top of the $8 million salary and a chief of staff who makes much more than a million dollars a year.
Donald Trump: (08:12)
But on top of all that, they were being terminated from their positions, these incredible people, in order to train the lower cost foreign workers imported to replace them. How’s that for a law? When this was set up originally to create jobs and economic development, and now they’re getting fired and they’re supposed to train people who get a much lower salary. It’s crazy.
Donald Trump: (08:39)
This was a grave injustice. I fired the chairman of the board and response. On Friday, I fired the chairman of the board along with one other board member. That’s the one thing we have. We have the right to fire board members. And I made it clear that if they did not swiftly reverse course, I would continue with these firings of the board members. And we just were informed that they have agreed to change course totally.
Donald Trump: (09:11)
And today, I’m proud to announce that a major victory for the workers of Tennessee, and Kentucky, and other areas that are covered, great states, great states. That the leadership of the TVA has canceled all of the layoffs and given hundreds of American workers their jobs back. They’re being rehired as we speak.
Donald Trump: (09:35)
In this administration, we live by two rules, buy American and hire American. You can’t do that. You can’t fire all our workers and hire people back from other far away parts of the world at lower prices, especially when they have to train the people. And they can never train them as good as what you have because they’ve been there for many years, they’ve done a fantastic job and they love the TVA. We had a lot of people in the office the other day. A lot of the media was covering it. They love the Tennessee Valley Authority. And they’re so proud to work for it, but this happened and it was a terrible thing. So now they’re going to get their jobs back. They’re all going to be getting their jobs back.
Donald Trump: (10:19)
Nearly every nation on earth continues to combat the virus. A number of countries are seeing a surge in new cases, including Japan, the Philippines, major parts of Europe. Cases continue to surge. In Latin America, it’s right now the most infected place anywhere in the world. They have more than doubled in recent days, Latin America is doing very little testing. They’re not really equipped to do that. It’s tough.
Donald Trump: (10:50)
In the United States, more than 80% of jurisdictions report declining cases, we’re doing very well. You don’t hear that too often from the media, but we’re doing very well. We have a very large country, very complex country in a sense. More than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week. So if you look at that, more than half of America’s counties report fewer than 20 cases last week, but we have to remain vigilant. We’re doing very well, but we have to remain vigilant.
Donald Trump: (11:24)
Nationally, the percentage of emergency room visits with the coronavirus symptoms is down to almost half what it was in July. The Southern states that were very strong hotspots not long ago, Arizona, Texas, Florida, continue to show significant improvement, including increased availability of hospital beds. Arizona now has the smallest number of coronavirus inpatients since mid June. It’s gone. The governor was up, and we had a great meeting. Governor Ducey, and the meeting was a terrific. But-
Donald Trump: (12:03)
Governor Ducey and the meeting was terrific. But since mid June so they’re doing well. And it’s going down, heading down very rapidly actually. Texas is stabilizing and improving rapidly with some progress in the Rio Grande Valley and other communities along the border with Mexico that had shown the biggest increases in hospitalizations and deaths. Florida is also stabilizing its statewide positive test rate continues to decrease from 13% on July 23rd to 8% this week. Florida has done very well. It’s going down, it’s heading down actually quite rapidly and even Miami which was the hottest spot in Florida is heading downward. But Florida has done very well. Texas has done very well and rapidly and Arizona has done incredibly well. So Arizona has really been a very rapid drop. New Jersey and New York remain stable with less than 1% of emergency room visits due to the China virus.
Donald Trump: (13:07)
The illness took a devastating toll on both states as you know. Well, both States really took the brunt of the infection earlier this year. Thankfully we have not seen a resurgence. They’ve been doing a good job. Everybody’s working very hard. Both governors are working very, very hard we’re in touch with them, we’re supplying them with a lot of supplies as needed if needed, but they’re needing very little right now. They’re in very good shape. We will continue to monitor the new cases. Throughout this crisis my administration has provided extraordinary support of people, equipment, medical supplies, to the people of New Jersey, the people of New York and to the people of every state, all of our states. We’re carefully monitoring California Central Valley, as well as San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento and San Francisco, which are starting to stabilize and go down. We’re carefully watching regions from increasing cases including Boston and Chicago, as well as the Midwest.
Donald Trump: (14:18)
We’re watching them all very carefully. It’s vital that all Americans work together to protect the vulnerable. For this reason, we’ve delivered vast amounts of protective equipment and testing supplies to nursing homes all across America. We’re focused very much on the elderly, especially the elderly where they have heart problems or diabetes problems. Diabetes is a big problem. Approximately half of all deaths have occurred in nursing homes and longterm care facility. That’s an incredible number when you hear half of the deaths have been in nursing homes and longterm care facilities. And I will tell you that I met with owners and representatives of nursing homes and they are very, very vigilant. They’re doing a very good job now. They’ve really done something that I think is special. They’re doing very well in terms of the virus. They’re working very hard and a lot of things happened. A lot of forces came together and hit the nursing homes very hard, but the representatives of nursing homes, in some cases the ownership of nursing homes they’re working very hard.
Donald Trump: (15:25)
The federal government and the private sector have delivered more than 9,000,000 N95 masks, 27 million surgical masks, 3 million face shields, 20 million gowns and 668 million gloves to New Jersey alone. Think of that. We provided $3.4 billion to the state of New Jersey in emergency relief funding. So we happen to be in New Jersey right now so those are great numbers. The governor’s working very hard. Governor Murphy’s doing a good job. We’re working very closely with him. We’ve also provided nearly $5 billion to New Jersey hospitals and healthcare facilities. And through the paycheck protection program that you all know so well, we provided $23 billion to support more than 250,000 New Jersey small businesses. A lot of the small businesses that you see that are opening now and going to do well they’re there because of what we did with paycheck protection.
Donald Trump: (16:27)
On therapeutics and vaccine updates, three vaccine candidates have now moved into phase three trials. This would be years ahead of schedule. We have done wonders with the FDA, want to thank the FDA and all of the great people there and Dr. Hahn. But we have phase three trials already going on, which is most people would have said impossible to even think about. Today Pfizer announced that it will manufacture Gilead’s remdesivir where we’ve had tremendous success. Last week alone my administration procured and distributed over 120,000 vials of remdesivir enough to treat more than 19,000 patients. Plasma treatments continue to show incredibly encouraging results, really incredible what’s going on. And if you can go to a blood bank, if you’ve had this disease and beat it, and there are a lot of people that have. If you could go to a blood bank and donate, that would be a tremendous help. The United States is only 5% of the world’s population, but we have conducted over 25% of the world’s testing. Think of that, 5% and we’ve given 25% of the world’s testing.
Donald Trump: (17:50)
Any proper global analysis of confirmed cases must really take this into account. We’re constantly showing cases, cases, cases, cases are up. Well, the reason cases are up because we’re doing, one of the reasons, we’re doing a lot of testing. We’re doing much more testing than anyone else. Close to 65 million tests where other countries have done very little testing. They’ll test people if they get sick, they’ll test people if they go into the hospital, they’ll test certain people. We’re doing tremendous testing and we’re especially doing big testing at the nursing homes. Over the last week the testing turnaround times have declined significantly as our major commercial labs have begun pulling samples. And we’ve also been able to send out many more of the tests which are the five minute to 15 minute result tests. Testing samples from multiple patients in one batch is also something that we’re very focused on and doing, but in the not too distant future we’ll have so many tests where it’s a quick test. They call it a quick test, five minutes to 15 minutes.
Donald Trump: (18:57)
So we won’t even have to worry too much about the process of sending and receiving. Because if you figure it takes a day to send and a day to receive and let’s say a day at the laboratory, that’s three days right there. Then the other tests you can have them in five to 15 minutes. Over the next two weeks I’ll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers. That’s a big thing. I’ve always been very strongly in favor. We have to cover preexisting conditions. So we will be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all of its customers. This has never been done before, but it’s time the people of our country are properly represented and properly taken care of. This follows a series of executive orders to lower drug prices and lower prescription drug prices. And significantly we had the only year which was last year where drug prices went down in 51 years.
Donald Trump: (20:06)
But we’re talking about going down at a level that nobody has even thought possible now. Even though the drug companies are running very big ads on me, but that’s usually a reason. They’re not too happy. They can’t be too thrilled, but they’ve made a lot of money over the years. And the prices just go up, not fair. This includes a landmark executive order requiring drug companies to change Americans and charge Americans no more than they charged to foreign countries. So they have to charge Americans no more than they charge to foreign countries. That means our country can’t be charged more. So if Germany gets drugs at a very small or low price and we’re paying many times that price in the United States because we pay for all of the research, development, the promotion and other things we will get what’s called a favored-nations clause. We’re going to have and I signed a favored-nations clause.
Donald Trump: (21:09)
So that the United States, which is the number one purchaser of drugs by far in the world, biggest purchaser in the world, not even close. You have other countries that are bigger. If you look at India, China, et cetera, not too many. But we have countries that are bigger but not even close in terms of ordering drugs, we’re the number one country in the world, but we have a favored-nation. So if somebody has a drug, many cases it comes from a plant. It’s the same pill, it’s the same medicine or medication, whatever the lowest country charges. So if Germany charges 25 cents for a pill and we charge $2 and I only use Germany as an example, then we get that or 25 cents.
Donald Trump: (22:01)
So what’s going to happen is that’s going to go up a little bit and ours is going to come down a whole lot. So it’s a favored nations. And I will tell you that Big Pharma is not happy. For too long we’ve been forced to subsidize cheaper drug prices in foreign countries. We’ve subsidized them to a level that nobody can believe. Nobody talked about it. Everybody wondered how come every president that runs for office says they’re going to lower drug prices and they never do, they go through the roof. Over the last administration they went up like skyrocketing, skyrocketing, that’s Biden. Biden’s not going to be able to do it. He has no clue. So what’s happening is we are going to be working to get rid of all the subsidy to foreign lands. And we’re going to give essentially all of the benefit that frankly they have as great negotiators those benefits are going to go to our people.
Donald Trump: (22:59)
So it’s called a favored-nations clause and you can look it up and you can see and nobody’s had the courage to institute it to call it because it’s a very big step. But it’s something that is going to drive drug prices down 50, 60, maybe even 70%. Talking about numbers that are unbelievable. I also signed an executive order stopping middlemen from taking advantage of Medicare patients by charging higher prices to them and pocketing the discounts for themselves. These are some of the richest people in the world. Everyone talked about middlemen. I’ve heard about them for years on prescription drug prices. Middlemen, I guess you’d have to say to be politically correct middlemen and women. But you never heard that the middle woman before you heard middlemen that’s the term. And say what you want about the drug companies, but at least the drug companies produce a product. They produce the pill, they produce the medicine, the medication.
Donald Trump: (24:03)
… product. They produce the pill, they produce the medicine, the medication. But these people make billions and billions of dollars. I don’t know who they are, but they’re very rich, but they won’t be so rich anymore. This executive order requires these $30 billion in discounts to go straight to the American patients. So the middleman is going to be knocked out, and I’m going to lose a lot of friends even though I have no idea who these people are.
Donald Trump: (24:28)
On opioids, I’m pleased to announce that my administration invested an additional $100 million to fight the opioid crisis in rural America. In the midst of the China virus pandemic, we also keep fighting to end the opioid epidemic, and we’ve done very well. It was prior to the virus, we were down 18%, 19%, and 20%. But when you think about it, that means that you have 80% and that’s not acceptable.
Donald Trump: (24:57)
The wall is going up. We have 276 miles of wall. It’s having a tremendous impact on drugs coming into our country already. It’ll be finished toward the end of the year, and its had a very, very big impact.
Donald Trump: (25:13)
On Portland, finally, I’d like to address that situation. Portland is a disaster. It’s been a disaster for many, many years. Brave federal law enforcement officers single-handedly… The officers, they single-handedly saved the federal courthouse in Portland from lawless rioters and agitators and anarchists, and that’s what they are. When you find Molotov cocktails in somebody’s knapsack and they say, “No, I’m just here to have a good time.” These are really sick, disturbed people. The disgraced of mayor of the city has ordered the police to stand down in the face of rioters, leaving his citizens at the mercy of this mob. He was at the mercy of the mob too. If you saw him go out there the other day, it was terrible. He went out there and they wanted to rip them apart. But fortunately he had five people with him, called security. Mayor Wheeler has abdicated his duty and surrendered his city to the mob. As a result, the mob descended upon a police precinct and tried to burn it down, tear it down, rip it down, and the act of attempted murder. Left wing violence extremism imposes an increasing threat to our country, and we stop it. You have no idea how much we stop, but It’s an ideology we have to stop.
Donald Trump: (26:43)
When you commit arson, this is a quote from the mayor, he’s come a long way. He just made this quote, “When you commit arson with an accelerant in the attempt to burn down a building that is occupied by people who have intentionally been trapped inside, you’re not a demonstrator or you’re not demonstrating” said Mayor Wheeler, “You are attempting to commit murder.” That’s come a long way, he’s come a long way when he made that statement. What you’re seeing in Portland is the radical left’s agenda in action. Portland is their roadmap for America. If the radical left gets in, and they treat Joe Biden as a puppet, he’s merely a puppet. But if the radical left gets in, they look at Portland as a thing that they want, that’s what they want. Why? Who knows, does it matter? It’s a different thinking, but it’s a mess.
Donald Trump: (27:48)
And I want to thank Homeland Security. They’ve done a fantastic job. We had our people go in. They stopped any intrusion into the courthouse and the courthouse was saved, and other federal buildings were saved. And we would like to be asked by the mayor or the governor, we will go in and stop the problems in Portland in 24 hours just like we did in Minneapolis after they really hurt that city. But the National Guard went and did a phenomenal job. It was over in three hours. After watching six days of horror, it ended in three hours. You all saw the scene of them walking right down the street. It was actually an unfortunate view, but an incredible view of how to do things. So we would be able to solve the Portland situation immediately. But we are supposed to be asked. If we are not asked, and if it continues, we’ll have to make a decision. But it’s a very easy thing for us to do. We could stop it very quickly. It’s been going on now for 76 days, but our buildings are very secure.
Donald Trump: (28:56)
If the Democrats controlled in Washington, the Democrats control of Washington, they’d pass with all of the things they do. Legislation gutting every single police department in America. They truly do, many of these people wanted to defund the police department. At a minimum, they’re going to stop money from going to the police department. But in many cases, they actually want to defund completely the police department. No city, no town, and no suburb would be safe. Your suburbs would be a disaster. Your cities, your towns would be a disaster. They want every city to be a Portland or to be a Chicago, which is totally out of control, and we’re waiting for the mayor. We’ve sent people in to help them from an intelligence standpoint, but we’re waiting for them to call, the governor, the mayor.
Donald Trump: (29:48)
We could do a very good job in Chicago. Nobody’s ever seen anything like that, this country. And yet nationwide, numbers are good despite the Chicago’s and Portland’s and frankly, the New York’s when you look at what’s happened in New York. 348% increase in the last number of months, nobody’s seen anything like that, so sad. To me it’s so sad because I love New York. And it’s so sad, and all it is, is horrible, horrible, incompetent management by politicians that truly don’t know what they’re doing. So just like we saved the courthouse, we will save the United States of America. And a vast majority of people agree with me, a vast majority, most people. They don’t speak up as much as they could, but we know they’re there and everybody else knows they’re there too.
Donald Trump: (30:39)
So with that, I’ll take a few questions from the media. They’ve been here for a long time and they’ve been waiting outside for a long time, and they wait for these moments. So it’s a lot of fun. Please go ahead.
Donald Trump: (30:53)
No, you. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: (30:55)
Oh thank you Mr. President. I have a couple of questions on the negotiations with Capitol Hill on the coronavirus legislation.
Donald Trump: (31:01)
Yeah?
Speaker 1: (31:01)
These executive orders you mentioned, do you have a timeline on when you’re going to sign them, or?
Donald Trump: (31:05)
Yeah, it could be by the end of the week, they’re being drawn by the lawyers right now. They work very nicely. It would be nice to be able to do it with the Democrats, but they’re really just interested in one thing, and that’s protecting people that have not done a good job in managing cities and states, and nothing to do with COVID, or little to do. They want to be able to make up for many, many years, in some cases decades of bad management, we can’t do that. So that is what they want. They want to do that, and we don’t want to do that.
Speaker 1: (31:35)
Are you concerned about the legality of these executive orders?
Donald Trump: (31:38)
No not at all, no. Well you always get sued. I mean, everything you do, you get sued. I was sued on the travel ban and we won. I was sued on a lot of things and we won. So we’ll see, yeah. Probably we get sued, but people feel that we can do it. Jeff, go ahead.
Jeff: (31:53)
Thank you, sir. Mr. President, the intelligence agencies today said that Russia is already meddling in this year’s elections to hurt Joe Biden, and that China is considering meddling to hurt you. Do you believe that intelligence, and what do you plan to do about it?
Donald Trump: (32:08)
I mean, I could be very much. I think that the last person Russia wants to see in office is Donald Trump, because nobody’s been tougher on Russia than I have, ever.
Jeff: (32:19)
That’s not what they calling it.
Donald Trump: (32:19)
Well, I don’t care what anybody says. Nobody with any common sense would say, “Do it.” Look at what we’ve done with our military. Look at what we’ve done in exposing the pipeline with billions of dollars going to Russia. Look at all of the things we’ve done with NATO, where I’ve raised $130 billion a year from countries that were delinquent, and now they’re paying all of this money. And the $130, by the way, $130 billion, not million, billion, goes to $400 billion over a few years. And that’s all money to protect against Russia. China would love us to have an election where Donald Trump lost sleepy Joe Biden. They would dream. They would own our country.
Donald Trump: (32:59)
If Joe Biden was president, China would own our country. And you said another country, what was the third country?
Jeff: (33:07)
No, just those two.
Donald Trump: (33:07)
You didn’t say that in the report. The report said Iran also, but you didn’t say that.
Jeff: (33:12)
I did-
Donald Trump: (33:12)
Iran would love to see me not be president. And I’ll make the statement, if and when we win, we will make deals with Iran very quickly, we’ll make deals with North Korea very quickly. And whatever happened to the war in North Korea, you haven’t seen that have you? If I didn’t win the election in 2016, our country would now be, maybe it would be over by now, but in war with North Korea. Everybody said, “Oh, Trump will get us in war.” No, just the opposite. And we actually have a relationship with North Korea, which is something that was never established by the previous administration. You would have been in war with North Korea and it would have been a very bad war. So North Korea, whether you look at Iran, every one of them will make a deal with us very quickly. Iran is dying to make a deal, but they want to see because they’d much rather make a deal with Biden, because if they make a deal with the United States, if China makes a deal with the United States with Biden in charge, they would own our country.
Donald Trump: (34:15)
Look what I’ve done. I’ve taken tens of billions of dollars from China. China was having the worst year they’ve had in 67 years. And we were having the best year we’ve ever had, with big tax cuts, with big regulation cuts, we’ve rebuilt our military, we became independent in terms of energy, we’re the energy leader of the world. We were having the best year we’ve ever had. By the way, African-American, Asian-American, Hispanic-American unemployment numbers are the best in the history of our country. And many other groups too including women, including high school diploma, no high school diploma, college diploma, everybody was doing better. The last thing that Russia wants and China wants, and Iran wants, would be for Donald Trump to win.
Donald Trump: (35:02)
Yes please, go ahead.
Jeff: (35:03)
Just a followup, what do you plan to do about that interference, sir?
Donald Trump: (35:08)
Well, we’re going to look at it very closely. You’re telling me that this came out a little while ago, and I’ve heard that it came out. It came out just a little while ago, and we’re going to look at that very closely, but you started off with Russia. Why don’t you start off with China? You think China is may maybe a bigger threat? I mean, I think maybe it is. I mean, you’ll have to figure it out, but we’re going to watch all of them. We have to be very careful.
Donald Trump: (35:31)
The biggest risk that we have is Mail-in ballots, because with the Mail-in ballot called Universal Mail-in ballots, it is a much easier thing for a foreign power, whether it’s Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, many others, people, countries you wouldn’t expect, it’s much easier for them to forge ballots and send them in. It’s much easier for them to cheat with Universal Mail-in ballots. So I think one of the things we’ll have to look at is exactly that, but that’s a big problem. That’s a big-
Donald Trump: (36:03)
Exactly that, but that’s a big problem. That’s a big problem. You saw in New York, they called the winner, but they have no idea what the vote is. Please go ahead.
Speaker 2: (36:09)
Mr. President, we’ve watched these negotiations go on for weeks. Do you think if you had been more directly involved, we would be in a different position [crosstalk 00:00:15]?
Donald Trump: (36:16)
No, I’m totally involved. No, they call me all the time. They tell me how they’re doing with Nancy and Chuck. But in my opinion, they’re just using it as an excuse to try and… Chuck Schumer came out with a strong statement today that you have to get back into school because it’s good for the economy, but he doesn’t do it. He doesn’t practice what he preaches. Now my people, Steven Mnuchin and our wonderful Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, they’re constantly on the phone with me. I’m totally involved with it and we are going to do it in a way that’s just much easier. We gave them their chance, but they view it as an election enhancement. You talk about foreign countries cheating on the election. Well, the Democrats are cheating on the election because that’s exactly what they’re doing. If you look at what they’re doing even with these negotiations, that’s an influence and an unfair influence on an election. But we’re going to win anyway. Yeah. Please go ahead.
Speaker 3: (37:09)
Mr. President, when was the last time you spoke with Speaker Pelosi though? We’re at this historic moment. Why haven’t you spoken with her?
Donald Trump: (37:13)
We’ll see, we’ll see what happens, but right now they’re not ready and they’re not ready because frankly I don’t think they care about people. I think they care about their politicians that have done a terrible job running the cities and states, Democrat cities and states that are bleeding money, that have been so badly run. You take a look at Baltimore and you take a look at so many different cities, including the ones I’ve already mentioned. Take a look at what’s going on. And they want lots of money to keep it going. For many years, they’ve been bad. So all I’m doing is we’re having it out. We’re finally having it out. Yeah, please.
Speaker 4: (37:51)
Mr. President, if you go ahead on your own on unemployment insurance, I’m wondering both where you’re going to get the money to pay for that without Congress, and will people still getting $600 a week?
Donald Trump: (38:04)
Yeah, we have the money. We have the money. Yeah.
Speaker 4: (38:05)
[inaudible 00:38:05] still get $600 a week? [crosstalk 00:38:07]
Donald Trump: (38:07)
I won’t say that yet. You’ll see that when it happens, but we have the money.
Speaker 4: (38:10)
Will you say what number?
Donald Trump: (38:11)
We have it Justin. We have plenty of money. Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 5: (38:14)
Thank you, Mr. President. You said that the pandemic is disappearing, but we lost 6,000 Americans this week. And just in this room, you have dozens of people who are not following the guidelines in New Jersey, which say you should not have more than 25-
Donald Trump: (38:27)
No, they don’t have to. It’s a political activity.
Speaker 5: (38:27)
[crosstalk 00:38:29].
Speaker 7: (38:27)
Boo.
Donald Trump: (38:32)
You’re wrong on that because it’s a political activity. They have exceptions. Political activity, and it’s also a peaceful protest. So when you have, and as you know… They asked if they could be here. And to me, they look like they all have, pretty much all have masks on. But you have an exclusion in the law. It says peaceful protest or political activity, right? In fact, specifically, yeah, it says exactly political activity or peaceful protest. And you can call it political activity, but I’d call it peaceful protest because they heard you were coming up and they know the news is fake. They understand it better than anybody. They asked whether or not they can be here. Like the question about Russia, he doesn’t mention Iran was in the report. He doesn’t mention, or he mentions very late, that China was in the report.
Speaker 6: (39:24)
China wants Biden.
Donald Trump: (39:25)
Because that’s the way they are. If the press in this country were honest, it wasn’t corrupt, if it wasn’t fake, our country would be so much further ahead. But we’re doing really great. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much.
Speaker 8: (39:36)
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two."
"Aug 4, 2020",5:46 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:03)
Let me begin by sending America’s deepest sympathies to the people of Lebanon, where reports indicate that many, many people were killed. Hundreds more were very badly wounded in a large explosion in Beirut. Our prayers go out to all the victims and their families. The United States stands ready to assist Lebanon. We have a very good relationship with the people of Lebanon and we will be there to help. It looks like a terrible attack. I also want to provide the latest on tropical storm Isaias. Approximately 600,000 are without power along the East coast and utility companies are working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible. I spoke to governor Cooper. I spoke to governor DeSantis and I spoke to all of the people at FEMA and they’re working very hard. Coastal areas in the storm’s path can expect to see the storm surge and rip currents.
Donald Trump: (01:10)
While inland areas could see flooding and very, very high winds. FEMA is responding to states that have requested the assistance. We have a list of those states we can give them to you in a little while and my administration is monitoring the situation very closely. We have the military on guard, but we have FEMA is there in all cases. Corps of engineer is ready if needed, the army Corps of engineers, very talented people. I urge everyone in the storm’s path to remain alert and to follow the guidance of your state and local authorities. I now want to update you on the path forward having to do with the China virus. Before I do that, I want to give you some numbers which are rather spectacular that just came out. The manufacturing index of the Institute for supply management, that’s ISM. Most of you know it by ISM, increased for the third month in a row rising nearly two points in July to 54.2. That was fantastic.
Donald Trump: (02:14)
The highest reading since March of 2019, this is remarkable considering the survey was conducted throughout July and showed significant improvement despite the Southwest in particular virus hotspots. The ISM measures and it’s a very strong measure. New orders rose five points in July to 61.5 and its highest reading that would be since September of 2018, that’s a big number. Since the April load new orders are up over 34 points, which is the largest increase in the history of the ISM dating back all the way to 1948. So 34 points that’s the largest since 1948. Similarly, the ISM’s measure of production is up 35 points from its April low to a reading of 62.1, which is the largest three month gain in over 70 years. That’s some number. These were somewhat surprising, but I’ve been saying we’re doing well and those numbers are really spectacular. Automobile sales likewise are a key factor in the resurgence of manufacturing since the March low of 8.8 million units with sales and all of the numbers that are going up stunningly. At 65% increase since then two 14.5 million units, which is a massive number. The great strength and great news is really four states like in particular, Michigan and Ohio, South Carolina, Pennsylvania, very good. Florida, little bit. These are great numbers, record setting numbers. The strength of new car sales is also evident in the used car market where soaring demand, literally soaring demand is putting upward pressure on the used car prices. This is a leading indicator of the motor vehicle industry. The need to restock depleted shelves will further galvanize the factory sector. And we think very substantially based on the numbers we’re very, very happy with these numbers. And I think most people are anywhere from surprised to shocked by these numbers in a very positive way.
Donald Trump: (04:49)
Economy-wide inventories crashed at a near $320 billion annualized rate last quarter. Crash in that case means a good thing, not a bad thing. That’s the largest drop ever on record ever. Home builder sentiment likewise is soaring as our home sales sentiment is now higher than last year. New homes recently made a 13 year high. So we have a 13 year high in new home construction. New business applications are very strong that just came out. The widely followed Atlanta fed GDP and it’s something that they have just come out with now. Forecasts see new data point and incorporates it into quarterly estimates. It looks like it’s showing a 20% annualized growth in the current quarter. So 20% in the current quarter, we’ll take that all day long. Let’s see if that’s right, that’s a projection. So we’ll see if that’s right. The Atlanta fed very respected.
Donald Trump: (05:57)
The virus, back to that, we are continuing to monitor and monitor a particular hotspots across the South Southwest and the West. And we’re seeing indications that our strong mitigation efforts are working very well actually. Especially to protect those who are most at risk, which has really been our primary focus for ever since we’ve gotten to understand this horrible plague that’s been unleashed in our country by China. As of yesterday cases are declining in 70% of the jurisdictions compared to 36% last Monday. That’s a big, big number. 11 out of 13 states with the positive rate above 10% have seen a decline in daily cases since mid-July. In other states, the data suggests that the need for continuing vigilance always strong, even though the numbers are getting very good. States that have a test positivity rate between five and 10% and in the states with the lowest positivity rates, we also see slight increases in daily cases in a couple of them. We must ensure that these states do not become new flare ups so we’re watching them very, very closely.
Donald Trump: (07:22)
Fortunately, thanks to substantial improvements in treatment and the knowledge we have gained about the disease itself the recent rise in cases has not been accompanied by a significant increase in deaths. Fatalities nationwide are at roughly half the level of the April peak. So the number of deaths or fatalities are at half the level. One is too much, one death because it should have never happened to us. It should have been stopped very easily by China in Wuhan. Thanks to our major advances in treatment we’ve seen vast improvements in recovery rates across all age groups. Compared to April mortality rates are 85% lower among individuals aged 18 to 69 and 70% lower among individuals over 70 years old. We’ve also made significant strides in sheltering those at highest risk, especially the elderly.
Donald Trump: (08:26)
Approximately 85% of all current cases are individuals under the age of 65. Just getting some very accurate numbers on this. And these are people who are generally at a much lower risk of complications. Since the pandemic began nearly half of all fatalities have been at nursing homes or assisted living centers. That’s an incredible statistic when you hear that number. This data underscores that the best path forward is an aggressive strategy focused on protecting Americans at highest risk as we race toward the development of a-
Donald Trump: (09:03)
Highest risk. As we race toward the development of a vaccine, we must continue to take extraordinary precautions to shield the elderly. And we’re doing that. We’re doing that at a level that we’ve never even dreamt possible, both with testing and with common sense. And those with underlying conditions, especially the elderly with the underlying, whether it’s heart or diabetes. They seem to be the two most predominant conditions that cause tremendous problems. While allowing those at lowest risk to carefully return to work and to school Where embers flare up, we must engage immediately. And that’s what we’re doing. This is the science based approach. And it’s good with us, working very hard on that.
Donald Trump: (09:49)
An extended lockdown would fail to target resources at the highest risk populations while inflicting massive economic pain, long lasting damage on society and public health as a whole. So there won’t be locked downs, but we watch specific areas. We’re very careful and we’re putting out embers. We’re putting out flames. When you look at what’s happening with Miami and it’s going, the numbers are going down, but Florida is going down very significantly. Texas and California are going down rather significantly.
Donald Trump: (10:27)
On telemedicine as we discussed the last time, and as I said numerous times during this day, it’s an incredible thing that’s happening. A central part of our effort to protect the elderly is to greatly expand access to telehealth. So seniors can be treated from the safety of their homes and that’s what’s happening. The number of Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth increased from roughly 14,000 a week to nearly 1.7 million. So from 14,000 to 1.7 million per week in total. 10 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed telehealth services since the pandemic began. That’s a tremendous thing that’s happened with telehealth.
Donald Trump: (11:10)
As we shelter those at high risk, we are also pouring every resource at our disposal into the development of therapies and vaccines. Two vaccine candidates are currently in the final stage of clinical trials with several more vaccine candidates entering phase three in the coming weeks. And you’ve read and seen what’s happened today. Today’s news was very exciting.
Donald Trump: (11:33)
Through operation warp speed we’re also mass producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates, and we’re determined to have a vaccine very quickly with it. We’re going to have something very soon. We have great companies. These are among the greatest companies in the world. But right now they don’t like me so much because I’m forcing them to drop drug prices, prescription drug prices vary massively. Some of these companies are involved in that. Some of them aren’t. We’re having a tremendous… You’ll see a tremendous drop in price. We’re using favored nations. We’re using the rebates. We’re using everything. So long I’ve heard about how wealthy the middlemen are. They call them the middlemen and they are very wealthy. Nobody even knows who they are, but they’re very wealthy people. That we’re doing the rebates. We’re doing purchases from other countries like Canada, which buys drugs for much less money than the United States is allowed to under a very bad system.
Donald Trump: (12:34)
I don’t call it archaic. I call it bad because it’s meant really for drug companies to get higher prices. But under the system of matching that we have, if Germany has a pill for 25 cents and ours is $2, we’re allowed to say, “We want favored nations. And we want the pill for the same, the same as the lowest country in the world.” If they sell to one country lower than anybody else, that’s the price we’re going to get. Drug companies aren’t too happy about that, big pharma.
Donald Trump: (13:04)
We’ve also dramatically accelerated the availability of plasma therapies, steroid treatments, antivirals, and other therapies to treat the illness. Today, the NIH were very exciting, announced that they’re beginning the trial of two new antibody treatments, which will take place in 40 cities across the country. We’re going to move very quickly. Results look very good, already, incredible results.
Donald Trump: (13:29)
More than 230 clinical trials for potential treatments are underway. And we’ve secured 500,000 courses of treatment for remdesivir. We’re really doing a job with it and it’s helping a lot of people. That’s why you see the fatalities and mortality numbers looking very good, relatively speaking, that is. But that’s for American hospitals through the month of September. So we have remdesivir at a very high level for hospitals through the month of September. That’s big news.
Donald Trump: (14:06)
The United States also has far and away, the most robust testing capacity in the world. Testing has been incredible, what we’ve been able to do. Nobody’s even close. Since March 12th, we’ve increased daily testing by 32,000%. How’s that? 32,000%. Somebody would say that must be a typo. It’s not a typo, 32,000%. We now have conducted over 61 million tests nationwide averaging over 820,000 tests per day and nearly five million tests per week.
Donald Trump: (14:36)
And now that we’re understanding the virus, we’re understanding very much what we’re doing with respect to who it affects, who it’s destroying and who gets away with it, like young people, very young people. We’ll be having some interesting statements having to do with testing and focus testing. I call it focus testing.
Donald Trump: (14:57)
By comparison, Mexico, so we’re doing numbers that are incredible, but by comparison, Mexico, as you know, the president was here. He’s a great guy, but their numbers are much different. They do about 1 million tests. France has done 2.9 million tests. Canada’s around the 4 million mark. Australia is around the 4 million mark. The United States is testing more people in a single week than. In many cases, large segments or large well known countries, all put together. It’s been an amazing achievement, the testing and the quality of the testing also. And now we’re doing testing where you can have results in five minutes, seven minutes, and 15 minutes, as opposed to waiting for it to come back from labs. Over the last several weeks, HHS has opened surging testing sites in Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Phoenix, Miami, Jacksonville, Florida, McAllen, Texas, Bakersfield, California. And this week we’re opening new surge sites in Houston, Texas, Atlanta. To date more than 130,000 tests have been conducted at these sites.
Donald Trump: (16:10)
Last week, the FDA also authorized the first two tests that display an estimated quantity of antibodies present in the individual’s blood, which is a big deal, allowing us to learn more about the immune response. FEMA and HHS has worked with the private sector to deliver more than… We have new numbers… More than 200 million N95 masks, 855 million surgical masks, 36 million goggles and face shields, 364 million gowns and coveralls and 21 billion gloves, billion. Can you believe that billion gloves? And we distribute that to the governors, different states. And when we get on the phone with them, they’re very happy. That I can tell you. No complaints from any of them. They’re very, very happy. What they say to you separately maybe will change for political reasons, but they are very happy with the job we’ve done.
Donald Trump: (17:07)
In our national stockpile, we’ve tripled the number of N95 masks on hand to more than 40 million, tripled the number of gowns to 15 million and quadrupled the number of ventilators to nearly 70,000. These numbers are growing every day. And we’re now making thousands of ventilators, many thousands of ventilators a month. And we’re getting them to other countries who are desperately in need of ventilators. They are very hard to produce. They’re very complicated machines. So we’re fully stocked here and we’ve made sure that every state is fully stocked, but we’re getting them to a lot of countries that need help.
Donald Trump: (17:45)
We’ll continue to work with the governors and local authorities to help them ensure significant hospital capacity, protective equipment, supplies, and medicine. I’m more confident than ever that we will get a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. And I want to thank you all for being here. We’ll take a few questions. Yeah.
Donald Trump: (18:03)
I want to thank you all for being here. We’ll take a few questions. Yeah, please.
Speaker 1: (18:05)
I wanted to ask you about Kodak. You had a big announcement the other day by getting Kodak into the pharmaceutical business, but the SEC is now investigating what happened. Can you say a word or two whether you think that there might’ve been some kind of a problem in terms of how those arrangements were made? Is there any grounds for concern from your perspective?
Donald Trump: (18:28)
No, I don’t know. I wasn’t involved in the deal. The concept of the deal is good, but I’ll let you know. We’ll do a little study on that. We’ll find out. If there is any problem, we’ll let you know about it very quickly, but I wasn’t involved in it. It’s a big deal. It’s a way of bringing back a great area too, in addition to pharmaceuticals. Kodak has been a great name, but obviously pretty much in a different business. And so we’ll see what that’s all about, but we’ll let you know very quickly. Yeah, please.
Speaker 2: (18:56)
I just want to follow up before I ask a coronavirus question on Lebanon. You called this an attack. Are you confident that this was an attack and not an accident?
Donald Trump: (19:06)
Well, it would seem like it based on the explosion. I’ve met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was. This was not some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event. This was seems to be, according to them, they would know better than I would, but they seem to think it was a attack. It was a bomb of some kind. Yes.
Speaker 2: (19:31)
And on coronavirus, you talked a lot about, when you talked about the mortality rate, the deaths as a proportion of cases, which I understand that is significant when you look at how deadly the virus is or how good a country does at keeping people alive. Who get infected. But when you’re talking about the scope of this virus, when you look at the percentage of the population that’s died, there’s only three countries that have more deaths than the US. So how do you explain that? That why the percentage of the population has died is so much higher in the US?
Donald Trump: (20:01)
Well, I think actually the numbers are lower than others. I’ll get back to you on that, but we proportionately are lower than almost all countries. We’re at the bottom of the list. And we’re relative to cases also, we’re at the bottom of the list, which is a good thing being at the bottom of the list, but I can get back to you. We have about four or five different lists on that. And we’re generally speaking at the very bottom of the list. So I’ll get back to you.
Speaker 2: (20:23)
When I look at the Johns Hopkins that coronavirus resource center is on their website, it says the most affected countries when you look at deaths per 100,000 people, the populations of how many people the population have died. You have the UK, Peru, Chile, and then the US. Canada has 8,000 9,000 deaths. Obviously they’re smaller than us, but that’s only 6% of the population. That’s 6% of our total cases. So why are the deaths so much higher in the US?
Donald Trump: (20:54)
Well, a lot of our numbers were based on the New York, had a very tough time as you know. New York, New Jersey, that area. And when you take them out, just as an example, take a look at Florida relative to New York. That’s not to say anything wrong with New York. It was just a very tough place. People are close together, it’s crowded. It’s not easy. But when you take that out, our numbers are among the lowest. And even with it in, I will get back to you but we have among the lowest numbers. They’ve done a fantastic job with it. Yeah. Go ahead.
Speaker 3: (21:23)
Yes mister president. I would like to ask a question about the election, but one thing on unemployment first. Are you considering taking executive action to extend or rather reinstate the unemployment benefits that expired last week if Congress can’t get a deal by the end of the week?
Donald Trump: (21:38)
Yes.
Speaker 3: (21:39)
And as a general point, what rate then would you want in there? A percentage or flat rate?
Donald Trump: (21:44)
We are looking at it. We’re also looking at various other things that I’m allowed to do under the system and such as the payroll tax suspension. And so we’re allowed to do things. We’re talking with the Democrats. They seem to be much more interested in solving the problems of some of the Democrat run states and cities that have suffered greatly through bad management. I mean really bad management. So that seems to be where they … They’re looking for a trillion dollars to help out with cities that are run by Democrats. In some case, radical left Democrats that have not done a good job. I appreciate today the Wall Street Journal said very good things that we did a great job in Portland by having our people go in Homeland Security. Chad Wolf and the folks, we went into Portland and we’ve done a great job.
Donald Trump: (22:34)
And they had that in an editorial that we really won that situation. But we want the whole … We did save the courthouse. The courthouse was going to be burned down or knocked down. It was in tremendous danger. We went in, we took care of it and we appreciated what the Wall Street Journal said. As far as the various things that I may or may not sign, I may not have to sign. I mean, progress is being made as you know, very well in the hill. We’ll see what happens. But I have the right, including the payroll tax suspension. We may do some things. We want to take care of the eviction problem. People are being evicted very unfairly. It’s not their fault. It’s China’s fault. It’s not their fault. And people are being evicted and we can do that with an executive order.
Donald Trump: (23:21)
So if we don’t get … And we want to do it relatively quickly. I mean, even from the standpoint of COVID, people get evicted and then they go into shelters and there are thousands of people in the shelters, and this is not a time … You never want to be in a shelter, but this is not a time to be in a shelter with the COVID. They catch it, they get it and it’s no good. So I may have to do something on evictions too because the Democrats amazingly don’t want to do it. We offered them short term deals and we offered them lots of alternatives. But so far, the only thing they really want to do is bail out states that have been poorly managed by Democrats. Okay.
Speaker 3: (23:55)
And if I could on the election, sir. Can I …
Speaker 4: (23:58)
President Trump, on the sale off TikTok, you’re basically arguing that the US government is going to collect a part of a transaction, including two companies, in which it doesn’t hold a stake and that’s unprecedented. And that’s never happened in us history before. And the administration has offered very little explanation about how that’s going to work. Can you back your statement out and provide specifics about how that would work?
Donald Trump: (24:20)
Did you say that’s impressive? Did you actually use that term?
Speaker 4: (24:22)
I said, it’s unprecedented.
Donald Trump: (24:24)
Oh. Well, it’s almost the same thing. Not quite. I like impressive. I like impressive. Not quite but close. So tick tack. TikTok is very successful. It does tremendous business in the United States. People are riveted by it. I mean, I have many friends, when they saw that announcement, that calling, I think their kids love it. They don’t because they don’t get to see their kids anymore, but they are … It’s an amazing thing, whatever it may be. And I told Microsoft and frankly others, if they want to do it, if they make a deal for TikTok, whether it’s the 30% in the United States or the whole company, I say, it’s okay. But if you do that, we’re really making it possible because we’re letting you operate here. So the United States treasury would have to benefit also, not just the sellers.
Donald Trump: (25:17)
And I said, inform …
Speaker 4: (25:19)
[inaudible 00:00:25:19].
Donald Trump: (25:19)
Very simple. I mean, we have all the cards because without us, you can’t come into the United States. It’s like, if you’re a landlord and you have a tenant, the tenant’s business needs rent. It needs a lease. And so what I said to them is whatever the price is, a very big proportion of that price would have to go to the treasury of the United States. And they understood that and actually they agreed with me. I mean, I think they agreed with me very much.
Donald Trump: (25:46)
Yeah, please in the back.
Speaker 5: (25:48)
Thank you sir.
Donald Trump: (25:48)
So that deal may or may not happen. We’ve given them till September 15th or so. And we’ll see if we can have it and if they can be great security, meaning the obvious security, Microsoft would be a company that would be good in that respect or approved in that respect at many levels, including working with the Department of Defense and they’re very high level approvals. So it would be good. But there are the companies also. Yes please.
Speaker 5: (26:12)
Thank you sir. Have you or anyone in the administration reached out to other companies, aside from Microsoft to see if they’re interested [crosstalk 00:08:20].
Donald Trump: (26:19)
No we’ve had other companies call us. Microsoft called me directly and we’ve had other companies call. I don’t know where they are. It sounds like Microsoft is along the way of doing something. I don’t blame them. It would be … It’s a great company. It’s really a great company, but we cannot take the security risks of any of those companies, including [Walway 00:26:40], which as you know, we put a halt to. But we can’t take the security risk. I think our attitude on China has changed greatly since the China virus hit us. I think it changed greatly. It hit the world and it shouldn’t have. They should have been able to stop it. So we feel differently. I just don’t know. When you lose so many thousands of people and ultimately …
Donald Trump: (27:03)
So many thousands of people and, you know, ultimately it’ll be millions of people around the world. It’s a terrible thing that happened to the United States and Europe and the entire world. Really a terrible thing. Yes, please.
Speaker 6: (27:14)
Thank you, Mr President. I have two quick questions, one on the virus and one on policing. On the virus, you said recently that there can be too much testing. Can you explain what the downside would be from testing too many Americans for the virus and why you haven’t provided a date by which all Americans might have the same kind of testing that we have here at the White House?
Donald Trump: (27:34)
We do more testing than anybody in the world, as I explained. And I don’t mean just a little bit. If you look at India, they’re at about 11 million. We’re at 61 million. And, there comes a point when you just, you want to focus your testing in a different way and we’ll be announcing stuff.
Donald Trump: (27:49)
What we’ve done is incredible with the testing. Not only the testing, not only the number of tests, but also very importantly, the quality of the test and the machinery itself to do the test. Nobody thought it would be possible to get a five- minute and a 15-minute result. That’s a very accurate result, and we do with Abbott. Abbott Laboratories has done a great job. Many of these companies have done an incredible job.
Donald Trump: (28:10)
So we’re looking at that very strongly. And we’re looking at doing something that if we do it… Look, right now, what the testing is doing is helpful, but we’re spending massive amounts of money and we want to have it channeled very accurately. We want to be able to help the most people we can. But, we are testing at a level that no country in the world, and I’ve spoken to the leaders of the world and they’ll ask me about it. No country in the world thought it would be it’s even believable that we’re able to test so much. 61 million versus, you know, most countries don’t even test. You know when they test? When somebody is feeling badly. If somebody is feeling badly, they’re symptomatic, that’s when they test. And that’s a big difference.
Donald Trump: (28:54)
With us we go around and looking because if we find spots, we find hotspots. One problem is from the standpoint of the media, we end up with far more cases than we would normally show. So it’s, you know, as I called it the other day in a statement I said, “It’s called media gold.” You know, for the media, it’s gold. But the truth is it’s… We’ve done an incredible job in testing. Nobody in the world has done the job. Other leaders have told me the same thing. They can’t believe we’re able to do it. And we will continue, but we want to really be able to test very specifically the people that are in most danger, most in need.
Speaker 7: (29:36)
Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you first about what you tweeted out earlier today in regards to Florida, and you’re comfortableness as it relates to mail-in ballots for Florida.
Donald Trump: (29:48)
Okay, I’m glad you’re asking.
Speaker 7: (29:49)
Why does that apply to Florida and it doesn’t apply to mail-in balloting across the country?
Donald Trump: (29:54)
So, Florida’s got a great Republican governor and it had a great Republican governor, Scott. Ron DeSantis, Rick Scott, two great governors. And over a long period of time, they’ve been able to get the absentee ballots done extremely professionally. Florida is different from other states. I mean, in Nevada, we have a governor, he said, “Let’s just send out millions of ballots.” And the post office cannot be prepared. I haven’t spoken to the post office about it, but I don’t know how they could possibly be prepared.
Donald Trump: (30:23)
Florida has been working on this for years and they have a very good system of mail-in and that would be absentee or even beyond absentee. So in the case of Florida, there aren’t too many people that would qualify, they’re so well-run. Florida’s a very well run state, low taxes, low everything. They’ve done a great job, really a great job. And the two governors, between the both of them, they’ve really got a great system of absentee ballots and even in the case of mail-in ballots. The postal services are built up there. You know, it takes a long time.
Donald Trump: (30:57)
When you look at the Carolyn Maloney election, I think they… And, I’ll give you the story. I think you have to do that election over. That election is no good. You have to take a look. In New York, they have thousands of ballots. They don’t know what happened to them. Is there fraud? Is there… It’s a disaster. That’s only for a relatively small number of ballots, but I think they have to do the election in New York over. The Times wrote a big story about it yesterday, front page story. It’s a disaster. It’s a mess. And they have to do that… I think they have to do that election over. Nobody can know what the election result is.
Donald Trump: (31:31)
So, in the case of Florida, they’ve done a great job. They’ve had tremendous success with it, but they’ve been doing this over many years and they’ve made it really terrific. So for Florida, you can mail in your ballots. You don’t have to go. In maybe a couple of other states they’ve worked out a system, but this took years to do. This doesn’t take weeks or months.
Donald Trump: (31:50)
In the case of Nevada, they’re going to be voting in a matter of weeks. And you can’t do that. I can’t imagine the post office could do it. All of a sudden they’re supposed to be dealing in millions of ballots, but Florida has done a great job. And we have total confidence that if you mail in your ballot in Florida, it’s going to matter.
Donald Trump: (32:05)
Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Speaker 6: (32:08)
What about in other states? Did you encourage voters in other states to request ballots?"
"Aug 3, 2020",3:01 P.M. EDT,"Jonathan Swan: (00:52)
Thank you so much for having us. We’re over here, Mr. President. Thank you. Kelly.
President Donald J. Trump: (01:07)
Okay.
Jonathan Swan: (01:09)
Mr. President, thank you for joining us.
President Donald J. Trump: (01:10)
Thank you very much.
Jonathan Swan: (01:11)
We appreciate you taking the time, and we appreciate your commitment to answer our questions.
President Donald J. Trump: (01:16)
Sure.
Jonathan Swan: (01:16)
We really appreciate that. Over the years, I’ve heard you talk about your adherence to a philosophy called positive thinking. Is this the mantra that if you believe something, if you visualize it, then it will happen?
President Donald J. Trump: (01:29)
To an extent. I also think in terms of the downside. I do. I’ve been given a lot of credit for positive thinking, but I also think about downside because only a fool doesn’t.
Jonathan Swan: (01:40)
To what extent do you think that that positive thinking mindset is suitable to handling the worst pandemic that we’ve seen in a century?
President Donald J. Trump: (01:49)
I think you have to have a positive outlook. Otherwise, you would have nothing without a positive outlook. I think we’ve done an incredible job, between the ventilators and stopping very infected people from China coming in, meaning putting the ban on China, which frankly nobody wanted me to do, practically nobody because it was very early in January. Then putting the ban on Europe, not an easy thing to do. When you put a ban on Europe, that’s a big thing. We would have probably lost hundreds of thousands of lives more had I not done that.
President Donald J. Trump: (02:18)
And all of the experts, every one of them, not one of them wanted to do it. They thought it was too severe. Three months later, they’re all saying, I’m glad you did it.
Jonathan Swan: (02:27)
The criticism of you that is most prominent, is about the communication. It’s the public health experts saying that it needs to be based in reality. And they’re saying that the wishful thinking and the salesmanship is just not suitable in a time when the pandemic has killed 145,000 Americans. And I understand what you’re saying, that people need to hear positive thinking, but for the past five months it’s been, the virus is totally under control, and the cases have been going up and the deaths have been going up.
President Donald J. Trump: (02:59)
Look, look.
Jonathan Swan: (03:00)
But you’ve been saying it’s under control.
President Donald J. Trump: (03:01)
Nobody knew what this thing was all about. This has never happened before. 1917, but it was a totally different, it was a flu in that case. Okay? But other than 1917, there’s never been anything like this. And by the way, if you watch the fake news on television, they don’t even talk about it. But you know, there are 188 of the countries right now that are suffering, some proportionately far greater than we are. Okay? As bad as we are.
Jonathan Swan: (03:24)
Very few. [crosstalk 00:03:25]
President Donald J. Trump: (03:24)
Some proportionately greater than we are. Right now, right now, Spain is having a big spike. There are tremendous problems in the world. You look at Moscow, look at what’s going on with Moscow. Look at Brazil, look at these countries what’s going on. This was sent to us by China, one way or the other, and we’re never going to forget it. Believe me, we’re never going to forget it.
President Donald J. Trump: (03:46)
And we were beating China at every single point. We were beating them on trade, we were making progress like nobody’s ever made progress. Before the pandemic, they had the worst year, Jonathan, that they’ve had in 67 years. You know that. With the tariffs and everything else I did, we would taking in billions of dollars. I was giving some of it to the farmers. The farmers were doing well because they were targeting the farmers, I was targeting China. We were doing good.
President Donald J. Trump: (04:14)
Then all of a sudden, the game changed, and I had to close it down. I closed down the greatest economy ever in history.
Jonathan Swan: (04:21)
I-
President Donald J. Trump: (04:21)
Well, wait. And then, I closed it down. And now we’re opening it. And we saved, by the way, by closing it down, we saved millions of lives. If we would have gone to herd and we knew very little about the disease, if we would’ve gone herd, we would have lost millions of people, millions of people. One person’s too much. We’re at 140,000 people. One person is too much. We’re at 140. We would have lost millions of people. And those people that really understand it, they really understand it. They said, it’s incredible the job that we’ve done. And again, I bring it up, the ban-
Jonathan Swan: (04:58)
Who says that?
President Donald J. Trump: (05:00)
Banning China from coming in far earlier-
Jonathan Swan: (05:03)
But it was already in here.
President Donald J. Trump: (05:05)
What’s that?
Jonathan Swan: (05:05)
It was already here. By the time you banned China, it came in through Europe.
President Donald J. Trump: (05:08)
Nobody knew the extent. Nobody knew how contagious it was. You know What? Maybe China knew.
Jonathan Swan: (05:12)
But the question is, Mr. President, by June we knew things were bad. And the last time I was with you was the day before your Tulsa rally in the Oval, and you were saying big, huge crowd, it was endorsed. These people, they listen to you.
President Donald J. Trump: (05:30)
By the way, [crosstalk 00:05:30] Excuse me, Jonathan, we had a 19,000 seat stadium and first of all, we had 12,000 people, not 6,000, which you reported and other people reported. But you couldn’t even get in. It was like an armed camp.
Jonathan Swan: (05:40)
Why would you want it that?
President Donald J. Trump: (05:41)
Because they had 120 Black Lives Matter people there and Tulsa-
Jonathan Swan: (05:44)
I understand but why would you have wanted a huge crowd?
President Donald J. Trump: (05:45)
Excuse me, wait. And Tulsa, well, because that area was a very good area at the time. It was an area that was pretty much over. [crosstalk 00:05:55] After, after, a month later, it started going up. That’s a month later, but Tulsa was a very good, Oklahoma was doing very well as a state. It was almost free. It spiked a month later, a month and a half, two months later. But it was a good area.
President Donald J. Trump: (06:09)
We had a tremendous crowd, we had tremendous response. It was like an armed camp. You couldn’t even get through. You couldn’t get anybody in. But we had 12,000 people. It was incorrectly reported. The other thing we had that nobody wants to talk about, so Fox broadcast it. It was the highest rating in the history of Fox television Saturday night. It was the highest rating.
Jonathan Swan: (06:33)
Mr. President-
President Donald J. Trump: (06:34)
Well, wait a minute. You’re saying something. That speech was the highest rated speech in the history of Fox television on Saturday night. And nobody says that.
Jonathan Swan: (06:44)
I think you misunderstand me. I’m not criticizing your ability to draw a crowd. Are you kidding me? I’ve covered you for five years. You draw massive crowds. You get huge ratings. I’m asking about the public health
President Donald J. Trump: (06:52)
I’m just saying this. I’m just saying this. At the time… And I canceled another one. I had to cancel it and we were going to have a great crowd in New Hampshire, and I canceled it for the same reason.
Jonathan Swan: (06:58)
But here’s the question. I’ve covered you for a long time. I’ve gone to your rallies. I’ve talked to your people. They love you. They listen to you. They listen to every word you say, they hang on your every word. They don’t listen to me or the media or Fauci. They think we’re fake news. They want to get their advice from you. And so, when they hear you say, everything’s under control, don’t worry about wearing masks. I mean, these are people, many of them are older people, Mr. President.
President Donald J. Trump: (07:19)
Well, what’s your definition of control?
Jonathan Swan: (07:20)
It’s giving them a false sense of security.
President Donald J. Trump: (07:21)
Yeah. Under the circumstances right now, I think it’s under control. I’ll tell you what-
Jonathan Swan: (07:25)
How? 1,000 Americans are dying a day.
President Donald J. Trump: (07:27)
They are dying. That’s true. And it is what it is. But that doesn’t mean we aren’t doing everything we can. It’s under control as much as you can control it. This is a horrible plague that beset us.
Jonathan Swan: (07:39)
You really think this is as much as we can control it? 1,000 deaths a day?
President Donald J. Trump: (07:43)
Well, I’ll tell you, I’d like to know if somebody… First of all, we have done a great job. We’ve gotten the governors everything they needed, they didn’t do their job. Many of them didn’t and some of them did. Someday we’ll sit down. We’ll talk about the successful ones, the good ones. Look at that smile. The good ones and the bad. We had good and bad. And we had a lot in the middle, but we had some incredible governors. I could tell you right now who the great ones are and who the not so great ones are, but the governors do it. We gave them massive amounts of material.
Jonathan Swan: (08:11)
Mr. President, you changed your message this week, in terms of you canceled the Jacksonville convention, you said, “Wear a mask.” You’re saying that, “It’s going to get worse before it gets better.” It’s not something you’d like to say, I know. And you said that. The big question-
President Donald J. Trump: (08:23)
By the way, not get worse like the original flow. You understand that.
Jonathan Swan: (08:27)
Well, I hope not. It’s a 1,000-
President Donald J. Trump: (08:29)
But If you look, Arizona’s going down. Texas is going down, and Florida is going down.
Jonathan Swan: (08:31)
If I could just finish my question. The question is, even some of your own aides wonder whether you would stick to that message until Election Day, whether in a week or two, you won’t say, “Right, we’ve got to reopen again. We can’t do this stuff anymore.” That you’ll get bored of talking about the virus and go back to that sort of cheerleading.
President Donald J. Trump: (08:52)
No, I’m not going to get bored. I never get bored of talking about this, it’s too big a thing.
Jonathan Swan: (08:54)
So will you stick to that message?
President Donald J. Trump: (08:54)
And again, it should have been stopped by China, and it wasn’t.
Jonathan Swan: (08:59)
But now it’s here and you’re the President.
President Donald J. Trump: (09:00)
We have it here.
Jonathan Swan: (09:01)
[inaudible 00:09:04].
President Donald J. Trump: (09:02)
No, I think I’m very consistent. No, this is a very serious thing. We have 140,000 people at this moment.
Jonathan Swan: (09:08)
More than that.
President Donald J. Trump: (09:09)
This is a very, very serious situation. And what you have to do, is handle it the best it can be handled. And again, I’m working with the governors. I got them tremendous amounts of equipment that they would have never gotten. Jonathan, they wouldn’t have equipment now, if I didn’t get.
Jonathan Swan: (09:25)
When can you commit, by what date, that every American will have access to the same day testing that you get here in the White House?
President Donald J. Trump: (09:34)
Well, we have great testing. We’re doing and many other people do-
Jonathan Swan: (09:37)
By what date?
President Donald J. Trump: (09:39)
Let me explain the testing. We have tested more people than any other country, than all of Europe put together times two. We have tested more people than anybody ever thought of. India has 1.4 billion people. They’ve done 11 million tests. We’ve done 55, it’ll be close to 60 million tests. And there are those that say, you can test too much. You do-
President Donald J. Trump: (10:03)
And there are those that say you can test too much. You do know that.
Jonathan Swan: (10:04)
Who says that?
President Donald J. Trump: (10:05)
Oh, just read the manuals, read the books.
Jonathan Swan: (10:08)
Manuals?
President Donald J. Trump: (10:08)
Read the books. Read the books.
Jonathan Swan: (10:10)
What books?
President Donald J. Trump: (10:11)
What testing does-
Jonathan Swan: (10:13)
Wait a minute. I’m sorry.
President Donald J. Trump: (10:14)
Let me explain. What testing does, it shows cases. It shows where there may be cases. Other countries test… you know when they test? They test when somebody is sick. That’s when they test. And I’m not saying they’re right or wrong. Nobody has done it like we’ve done it. We’ve gotten absolutely no credit for it. But we’ve come up with so many different tests. The only thing that we have now is some people have to wait longer than we’d like them to. We want it-
Jonathan Swan: (10:38)
That’s a big problem.
President Donald J. Trump: (10:39)
We want point to point. We want to have a five minute to a 15 minute test.
Jonathan Swan: (10:44)
Right. When do you think-
President Donald J. Trump: (10:44)
And we have… and like many others-
Jonathan Swan: (10:46)
Every American-
President Donald J. Trump: (10:47)
And, from what I understand, we’re close to 50% where it’s point to point tests. We are making thousands of instruments, thousands of tests right now, tens of thousands that can be distributed to various parts of the country. But you have to understand. And we’ve even sent some of them to other countries where they had a big problem. Jonathan, almost 50%, in fact, I think the number might be over, is immediate testing. The other is tough. You take a test. You have to send it to a laboratory. Let’s say that takes a day. Let’s say it’s a day.
Jonathan Swan: (11:19)
Right. It’s difficult.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:20)
So, it’s three, or four, or five days.
Jonathan Swan: (11:21)
I understand.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:21)
There is nothing you can do about that.
Jonathan Swan: (11:22)
But when do you think you will have it for everyone? What day?
President Donald J. Trump: (11:25)
I think that you will have that relatively soon. I mean-
Jonathan Swan: (11:27)
What does that mean?
President Donald J. Trump: (11:28)
You already have half.
Jonathan Swan: (11:29)
Yeah.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:31)
I would much rather get back to you.
Jonathan Swan: (11:32)
Okay. That’s fine.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:32)
Because I don’t want to have you write in one month, I didn’t make it.
Jonathan Swan: (11:35)
That’s fine.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:35)
I missed it by a day.
Jonathan Swan: (11:36)
Yeah. I get it.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:37)
And it’s a headline.
Jonathan Swan: (11:37)
Mr. President, I want to talk about the federal intervention.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:40)
Excuse me. One thing I would say about testing.
Jonathan Swan: (11:42)
Yeah. Yeah.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:43)
Because we test so much, we show cases. So, we show many, many cases. We show tremendous number of cases. I know you’re smiling when I say that, but I’m telling you.
Jonathan Swan: (11:52)
Well, I mean, I’ve heard you say this.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:54)
I know. Other countries don’t test like we do. So, they don’t show case.
Jonathan Swan: (11:58)
Just a couple points on that. I wasn’t going to continue on the testing, but you said it. So, we’re testing so much because it’s spread so far in America. And, when you-
President Donald J. Trump: (12:06)
We’re testing so much because we had the ability to test.
Jonathan Swan: (12:08)
Okay.
President Donald J. Trump: (12:09)
Because we came up with test-
Jonathan Swan: (12:10)
But South Korea-
President Donald J. Trump: (12:11)
Jonathan, we didn’t even have a test. When I took over, we didn’t even have a test. Now, in all fairness-
Jonathan Swan: (12:17)
Why would you have a test?
President Donald J. Trump: (12:21)
There was no test for this-
Jonathan Swan: (12:23)
The virus didn’t exist.
President Donald J. Trump: (12:23)
Excuse me. I was going to say-
Jonathan Swan: (12:23)
Okay.
President Donald J. Trump: (12:23)
There was no test for this. We didn’t have a test because there was no test.
Jonathan Swan: (12:26)
Of course.
President Donald J. Trump: (12:27)
And, in a very short order, we got one test. We got another test.
Jonathan Swan: (12:30)
It was broken, the first one.
President Donald J. Trump: (12:31)
We got another. Many of those tests are now obsolete because it’s called science.
Jonathan Swan: (12:34)
Right.
President Donald J. Trump: (12:34)
And, all of a sudden, something is better. But, because we tested so many people, 55, 60 million people, very soon, we get cases. You test. Some kid has even just a little runny nose. It’s a case. And then, you report many cases. So, we look like we have more cases than massive countries like China, which by the way, doesn’t report, as you know.
Jonathan Swan: (12:58)
Well, I don’t put any stock in China’s figures.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:00)
No. No. The point is-
Jonathan Swan: (13:01)
Yeah.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:01)
The point is, because we are so much better at testing than any other country in the world, we show more cases.
Jonathan Swan: (13:09)
The figure I look at is death. And death is going up now.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:12)
Okay. No, no.
Jonathan Swan: (13:12)
It’s a thousand a day.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:14)
If you look at death-
Jonathan Swan: (13:15)
Yeah. It’s going up again.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:16)
Let’s look. Let’s look.
Jonathan Swan: (13:17)
Daily death.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:17)
Take a look at some of these charts.
Jonathan Swan: (13:19)
I’d love to.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:20)
We’re going to look.
Jonathan Swan: (13:21)
Let’s look.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:21)
And, if you look at death per-
Jonathan Swan: (13:23)
Yeah. It’s started to go up again.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:25)
Here is one. Well, right here, United States is lowest in numerous categories. We’re lower than the world.
Jonathan Swan: (13:37)
Lower than the world?
President Donald J. Trump: (13:37)
We’re lower than Europe.
Jonathan Swan: (13:39)
What does that mean? In what? In what?
President Donald J. Trump: (13:40)
Look. Take a look. Right there. Here is case death.
Jonathan Swan: (13:46)
Oh, you’re doing death as a proportion of cases. I’m talking about death as a proportion of population. That’s where the U.S. is really bad, much worse than South Korea, Germany, et cetera.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:55)
You can’t do that.
Jonathan Swan: (13:56)
Why can’t I do that?
President Donald J. Trump: (13:58)
You have to go by where… look. Here is the United States. You have to go by the cases. The cases are there.
Jonathan Swan: (14:04)
Why not as a proportion of population?
President Donald J. Trump: (14:07)
What it says is, when you have somebody where there’s a case-
Jonathan Swan: (14:11)
Oh, okay.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:11)
The people that live from those cases.
Jonathan Swan: (14:14)
Oh. It’s surely a relevant statistic to say, if the U.S. has X population and X percentage of death of that population versus South Korea-
President Donald J. Trump: (14:22)
No. Because you have to go by the cases.
Jonathan Swan: (14:22)
Well, look at South Korea, for example. 51 million population, 300 deaths. It’s like, it’s crazy compared to-
President Donald J. Trump: (14:28)
You don’t know that.
Jonathan Swan: (14:29)
I do.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:30)
You don’t know that.
Jonathan Swan: (14:31)
You think they’re faking their statistics, South Korea? An advanced country?
President Donald J. Trump: (14:33)
I won’t get into that because I have a very good relationship with the country.
Jonathan Swan: (14:36)
Yeah.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:37)
But you don’t know that. And they have spikes. Look, here’s one of-
Jonathan Swan: (14:39)
Germany, low 9,000.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:40)
Here’s one. Here’s one right here, United States.
Jonathan Swan: (14:43)
Let me look.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:44)
You take the number of cases.
Jonathan Swan: (14:45)
Okay.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:45)
Now look, we’re last meaning we’re first.
Jonathan Swan: (14:47)
Last? I don’t know what we’re first in.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:48)
We have the best.
Jonathan Swan: (14:49)
As a what?
President Donald J. Trump: (14:50)
Take a look again. It’s cases.
Jonathan Swan: (14:51)
Okay. I’ll just… okay.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:52)
And we have cases because of the testing.
Jonathan Swan: (14:54)
I mean, a thousand Americans die a day. But I understand. I understand on the cases, it’s different.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:59)
No, but you’re not reporting it correctly, Jonathan.
Jonathan Swan: (15:02)
I think I am, but-
President Donald J. Trump: (15:03)
If you take a look at this other chart… look, this is our testing. I believe this is the testing. Yeah.
Jonathan Swan: (15:09)
Yeah. We do more tests.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:10)
No, wait a minute. Well, don’t we get credit for that? And, because we do more tests, we have more cases. In other words, we test more. We have… now, take a look. The top one, that’s a good thing not a bad thing. But the top… Jonathan-
Jonathan Swan: (15:22)
If hospitals rates were going down and deaths were going down, I’d say, terrific. You deserve to be praised for testing.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:28)
Well, they don’t even-
Jonathan Swan: (15:28)
But they are all going up.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:29)
Well, they very rarely talk-
Jonathan Swan: (15:30)
Plus, 60,000 Americans are in hospital, 1,000 dying a day.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:32)
If you watch the news or read the papers, they usually talk about new cases, new cases, new cases.
Jonathan Swan: (15:37)
I’m talking about death.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:38)
Well, you look at death.
Jonathan Swan: (15:39)
It’s going up.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:39)
Death is way down from where it was.
Jonathan Swan: (15:42)
It’s 1,000 a day.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:43)
Death-
Jonathan Swan: (15:43)
It was two and a half thousand. It went down to 500. Now, it’s going up again.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:46)
Death… excuse me. Where it was is much higher than where it is right now.
Jonathan Swan: (15:50)
It went down and then it went up again.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:52)
It spiked, but now it’s going down again.
Jonathan Swan: (15:53)
It’s going up.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:53)
It’s gone down in Arizona. It’s going down in Florida.
Jonathan Swan: (15:55)
nationally it’s going up.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:56)
It’s going down in Texas. Take a look at this. These are the tests.
Jonathan Swan: (15:59)
It’s going down in Florida?
President Donald J. Trump: (16:01)
Yeah. It leveled out and it’s going down. That’s my report, as of yesterday.
Jonathan Swan: (16:05)
Anyway, Mr. President, if I could change subjects.
President Donald J. Trump: (16:06)
It is going down in Arizona. It is gong down in Texas.
Jonathan Swan: (16:09)
Arizona it is. Arizona it is. Texas has big problems.
President Donald J. Trump: (16:10)
And it is spiked. It spiked and is now going down in Florida. It’s evened out and going down in Florida.
Jonathan Swan: (16:15)
I’ll have to see those figures.
President Donald J. Trump: (16:16)
But you have to look at this. This is the number of tests compared to the rest of the world.
Jonathan Swan: (16:19)
I don’t deny your figures. You’ve done more tests by far than the rest of the world. I don’t deny that.
President Donald J. Trump: (16:22)
Right. And, because we’ve done more tests, we have more cases.
Jonathan Swan: (16:24)
You have more infections.
President Donald J. Trump: (16:25)
Now, you can take them back. Check it out in your office.
Jonathan Swan: (16:28)
Mr. President, different subject, it’s been widely reported that the U.S. has intelligence indicating that Russia paid bounties or offered to pay bounties to Taliban fighters to kill American soldiers.
President Donald J. Trump: (16:37)
Right. Right.
Jonathan Swan: (16:37)
You had a phone call with Vladimir Putin on July 23rd. Did you bring up this issue?
President Donald J. Trump: (16:42)
No. That was a phone call to discuss other things. And frankly, that’s an issue that many people said was fake news.
Jonathan Swan: (16:50)
Who said it was fake news?
President Donald J. Trump: (16:51)
I think a lot of people. If you look at some of the wonderful folks from the Bush Administration, some of them, not any friends of mine, were saying that it’s a fake issue. But a lot of people said, it’s a fake issue.
Jonathan Swan: (17:04)
There was dispute within intelligence.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:05)
But we had a call. We had a call talking about nuclear proliferation.
Jonathan Swan: (17:08)
Right.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:08)
Which is a very big subject where they would like to do something. And so would I. We discussed numbers things. We did not discuss that. No.
Jonathan Swan: (17:14)
And you’ve never discussed it with him.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:15)
I have never discussed it with him. No. I would. I’d have no problem with it.
Jonathan Swan: (17:19)
But you don’t believe the intelligence.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:19)
But you know it never got to-
Jonathan Swan: (17:20)
It’s because you don’t believe the intelligence. That’s why.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:24)
It’s interesting. Nobody ever brings up China. They always bring Russia, Russia, Russia. If we can do something with Russia in terms of nuclear proliferation, which is a very big problem.
Jonathan Swan: (17:34)
Right.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:34)
Bigger problem than global warming.
Jonathan Swan: (17:36)
Right.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:36)
A much bigger problem than global warming in terms of the real world, that would be a great thing. No. It never reached my desk.
Jonathan Swan: (17:43)
Okay.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:43)
You know why? Because intelligence, they didn’t think it was real.
Jonathan Swan: (17:48)
It was in your written brief though about it.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:50)
They didn’t think it was worthy. I wouldn’t mind. If it reached my desk, I would have done something about it. It never reached my desk because-
Jonathan Swan: (17:57)
Do you read your written brief?
President Donald J. Trump: (17:58)
I do.
Jonathan Swan: (17:58)
Do you?
President Donald J. Trump: (17:58)
I read it a lot.
Jonathan Swan: (17:59)
Really?
President Donald J. Trump: (17:59)
I read a lot. They like to say I don’t read. I read a lot.
Jonathan Swan: (18:03)
You read your daily intelligence brief?
President Donald J. Trump: (18:04)
I comprehend extraordinarily well, probably better than anybody that you’ve interviewed in a long time. I read a lot. I spend a lot of time at meetings. Usually it’s once a day or at least two or three times a week, intelligence meetings.
Jonathan Swan: (18:18)
Because this was apparently in your-
President Donald J. Trump: (18:19)
Talking about India, talking about the problems with China.
Jonathan Swan: (18:22)
Right.
President Donald J. Trump: (18:22)
Talking about so many different elements of the world.
Jonathan Swan: (18:25)
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
President Donald J. Trump: (18:25)
The world is a very angry place, if you look all over the world. We call up. I see a 22 soldiers were killed in India with China fighting over the border. It’s been raging for many, many decades. And they’ve been fighting and back and forth. I have so many briefings on so many different countries, but this one didn’t reach my desk.
Jonathan Swan: (18:50)
The reason I say this is, even if you don’t believe this particular piece of intelligence, and there is dispute, no doubt, there is dispute in the intelligence committee about it, John Nicholson, former head of forces in Afghanistan said, and this is when he was working for you, that Russia is supplying weapons to the Taliban. Isn’t that enough to challenge Putin over the killings of U.S. soldiers?
President Donald J. Trump: (19:10)
Well, we sold them weapons when they were fighting Russia too. When they were fighting with the Taliban in Afghanistan-
Jonathan Swan: (19:17)
Yeah. But that’s a different era.
President Donald J. Trump: (19:18)
Well, it’s a different… I’m just saying. Yes.
Jonathan Swan: (19:20)
But how does that affect-
President Donald J. Trump: (19:21)
I’m just saying we did that too.
Jonathan Swan: (19:22)
But how does that-
President Donald J. Trump: (19:23)
I don’t know. I didn’t ask Nicholson about that. He was there for a long time. Didn’t have great success because he was there before me. And then, ultimately, I made a change.
Jonathan Swan: (19:30)
But you surely heard that. Right? I mean, it’s well known in the intelligence community, that they’re arming the Taliban, Russia.
President Donald J. Trump: (19:36)
I don’t know. When you say arming is-
Jonathan Swan: (19:38)
Supplying weapons.
President Donald J. Trump: (19:39)
Paying or they-
Jonathan Swan: (19:40)
Russia is supplying weapons and money to the Taliban.
President Donald J. Trump: (19:42)
I have heard that but, again, it’s never reached my desk.
Jonathan Swan: (19:48)
I mean, he said it on the record when he was in-
President Donald J. Trump: (19:50)
Hey, Russia doesn’t want anything to do with Afghanistan. Let me just say about Russia. Russia used to be a thing called the Soviet Union. Because of Afghanistan, they went bankrupt. They became Russia, just so you do understand. Okay? The last-
President Donald J. Trump: (20:03)
Went bankrupt, they became Russia, just so you do understand, okay? The last thing that Russia wants to do is get too much involved with Afghanistan. They tried that once. It didn’t work out too well.
Jonathan Swan: (20:09)
Last question on this subject.
President Donald J. Trump: (20:10)
And by the way, we’re largely out of Afghanistan, as you probably know.
Jonathan Swan: (20:13)
Well, I wanted to ask you about that. The US troop level in Afghanistan right now is roughly the same as it was when you-
President Donald J. Trump: (20:21)
No, you’re wrong. No.
Jonathan Swan: (20:22)
Mr. President. I’m sorry. We have to do-
President Donald J. Trump: (20:24)
Okay. Are you ready?
Jonathan Swan: (20:25)
No, no. I need-
President Donald J. Trump: (20:25)
We’ll be down in a very short… It’s already planned.
Jonathan Swan: (20:27)
Well, that’s a different question.
President Donald J. Trump: (20:28)
Let me explain. We’ll be down in a very short period of time to 8,000, then we’re going to be down to 4,000. We’re negotiating right now. We’ve been there for 19 years.
Jonathan Swan: (20:38)
I know. I know.
President Donald J. Trump: (20:38)
19 years.
Jonathan Swan: (20:39)
But if you just let me finish my question.
President Donald J. Trump: (20:40)
We’ll be getting out.
Jonathan Swan: (20:41)
I understand. Look, when you came in, it was 8,800. You boosted to 14,000, and now you’re back down to 8,500.
President Donald J. Trump: (20:49)
We’re now-
Jonathan Swan: (20:49)
My question to you-
President Donald J. Trump: (20:51)
We’ll be at 4,000. I’ll get you the exact-
Jonathan Swan: (20:52)
When?
President Donald J. Trump: (20:53)
Very soon. Very soon.
Jonathan Swan: (20:54)
What will be the number? Very soon? 4,000?
President Donald J. Trump: (20:56)
Very soon. Yeah, very soon.
Jonathan Swan: (20:57)
Like how soon?
President Donald J. Trump: (20:58)
I don’t want to tell you that. I don’t want to tell you.
Jonathan Swan: (21:00)
That’s big news.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:01)
What is? That is [crosstalk 00:21:02]
Jonathan Swan: (21:02)
It’s going down to 4,000.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:03)
I’ve always said-
Jonathan Swan: (21:04)
Well, what about election day?
President Donald J. Trump: (21:06)
We will get largely out-
Jonathan Swan: (21:07)
On election day, how many American troops will be in Afghanistan?
President Donald J. Trump: (21:12)
Probably anywhere from four to 5,000.
Jonathan Swan: (21:16)
That’s almost as many as when you came into office.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:17)
No, it’s not. We had-
Jonathan Swan: (21:18)
8,000.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:19)
We had much more. We had a lot of people over there too.
Jonathan Swan: (21:21)
8,800 [crosstalk 00:21:22] troops.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:22)
A lot of people. And we did a good job. We wiped out ISIS. Let me just tell you what you don’t see.
Jonathan Swan: (21:25)
Have you thought about going down to zero?
President Donald J. Trump: (21:26)
We took out, in Syria, we took out ISIS. We a hundred percent of the caliphate. When I took over Obama, it was totally rampant. ISIS was all over the place. We took them out. We captured them. We killed them a hundred percent, not 99%. I wanted to get out at 99. Everyone said, “Oh, please, would you stay?” I stayed. 99% was good, but a hundred percent of the caliphate.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:52)
We took out Soleimani. We took out al-Baghdadi. We took out people that nobody thought possible. Al-Baghdadi was the biggest terrorist of them all. They couldn’t find him. I took him out. Soleimani, even bigger. I took him out. I’ve done things that no other president’s done. None. I mean, fortunately, not too many. They should have never been in the Middle East. The decision to go to the Middle East and get into the Middle East was the single biggest mistake made in the history of our country. That’s my opinion.
Jonathan Swan: (22:22)
You told Fox News recently that you couldn’t say whether you’d accept the results of the 2020 election. What does that actually look like as the sitting president? I mean, it’s unprecedented. What would that actually look like?
President Donald J. Trump: (22:36)
Well, Hillary Clinton never accepted them.
Jonathan Swan: (22:37)
Well, she conceded on them.
President Donald J. Trump: (22:39)
I mean, she doesn’t accept them and she got beaten very easily.
Jonathan Swan: (22:41)
But that’s the important point. That’s the important point. She conceded on election night. Now, she grumbled about it and said all sorts of-
President Donald J. Trump: (22:45)
Grumbled? Grumbled? She wrote books about it.
Jonathan Swan: (22:46)
Okay, fine, she wrote books.
President Donald J. Trump: (22:47)
And don’t use the word grumbled.
Jonathan Swan: (22:48)
Fine. But-
President Donald J. Trump: (22:48)
She wrote books about it.
Jonathan Swan: (22:50)
That’s fine, but I just-
President Donald J. Trump: (22:50)
She got beaten easy.
Jonathan Swan: (22:51)
I get it. I get it.
President Donald J. Trump: (22:52)
306 to 223. That’s a lot. That’s a lot.
Jonathan Swan: (22:54)
I’m not disputing you beat Hillary Clinton. Listen, what of asking is you’ll be the sitting president in the White House. What does that look like not accepting-
President Donald J. Trump: (23:03)
I’ll tell you what it looks like.
Jonathan Swan: (23:04)
Are you litigating?
President Donald J. Trump: (23:05)
Let me tell you what it looks.
Jonathan Swan: (23:05)
Okay.
President Donald J. Trump: (23:07)
So we have a new phenomena. It’s called mail-in voting, where you send, where a governor-
Jonathan Swan: (23:13)
New?
President Donald J. Trump: (23:13)
Well, it’s new-
Jonathan Swan: (23:14)
It’s been here since the Civil War. Americans have-
President Donald J. Trump: (23:15)
In terms of kind of the kind of millions and millions of ballots. They’ve never done anything like that.
Jonathan Swan: (23:21)
It’ll be bigger this year because of the pandemic.
President Donald J. Trump: (23:23)
Bigger? Not bigger, massively bigger.
Jonathan Swan: (23:25)
Yeah, because of the pandemic.
President Donald J. Trump: (23:26)
So they’re going to send tens of millions of ballots to California, all over the place, to who’s going to get them. I have a friend who lives in Westchester County-
Jonathan Swan: (23:33)
They send applications, not allots.
President Donald J. Trump: (23:35)
His son passed away. He had a beautiful, wonderful son. Young man. Passed away seven years ago. He called me, he said, “I just got a ballot for my son, Robert.”
Jonathan Swan: (23:46)
Probably an application.
President Donald J. Trump: (23:46)
“He died seven years ago.” Somebody got at ballot for a dog. Somebody got a ballot for something else. You got millions of ballots going, nobody even knows where they’re going. You look at some of the corruption having to do with universal mail-in voting… Absentee voting is okay. You have to apply, you have to go through a process.
Jonathan Swan: (24:03)
You have to apply for mail-in. It’s the same thing.
President Donald J. Trump: (24:05)
Absentee voting is good. Look, you’re sending it out-
Jonathan Swan: (24:07)
Let’s do concrete. Let’s do concrete.
President Donald J. Trump: (24:08)
Jonathan, they’re sending out-
Jonathan Swan: (24:10)
Applications. You download them off [crosstalk 00:24:12]
President Donald J. Trump: (24:12)
Governors, millions of ballots. There is-
Jonathan Swan: (24:14)
No, they’re not. It’s applications. You can get them off the internet.
President Donald J. Trump: (24:16)
There is no way you can go through a mail-in vote without massive cheating.
Jonathan Swan: (24:22)
I honestly don’t understand this topic with-
President Donald J. Trump: (24:24)
Go ahead.
Jonathan Swan: (24:25)
The Republican party has an extremely well-funded vote by mail program. Your campaign puts out emails telling people to vote by mail.
President Donald J. Trump: (24:33)
Correct.
Jonathan Swan: (24:34)
Your daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, she did robocalls in California saying it’s safe and secure, mail-in voting.
President Donald J. Trump: (24:40)
Let me tell you. We have no choice.
Jonathan Swan: (24:41)
The Republic won. That was an all mail-in race.
President Donald J. Trump: (24:43)
Let me tell you. You ready?
Jonathan Swan: (24:45)
Yeah.
President Donald J. Trump: (24:45)
We have no choice because right now, we have, but we have many court cases that we’re waiting. We have one filed in Western Pennsylvania. We have many court cases where we’re trying to end it. We went through World War I, you went to the polls, you voted, we went through World War II, you went to the polls, you voted.
Jonathan Swan: (25:01)
You’ve had mail-in voting since the Civil War.
President Donald J. Trump: (25:02)
And now because of the China virus, we’re supposed to stay home, send millions of ballots all over the country, millions and millions. You know, you could have a case where this election won’t be decided on the evening of November 3rd.
Jonathan Swan: (25:16)
Absolutely. What’s wrong with that?
President Donald J. Trump: (25:16)
This election could be decided two months later,
Jonathan Swan: (25:18)
It won’t be two months, but what’s wrong with the proper mail-in count?
President Donald J. Trump: (25:20)
It could be decided many months later.
Jonathan Swan: (25:22)
Have you discussed the-
President Donald J. Trump: (25:23)
You know why? Because lots of things will happen during that period of time. Especially when you have tight margins, lots of things can happen. There’s never been anything like this when you try… Now, of course, right now, we have to live with it, but we’re challenging it in many courts, as you know, all over the country.
Jonathan Swan: (25:40)
You’re going to [crosstalk 00:25:38]? Mr. President, the other day, a reporter asked you about Ghislaine Maxwell. You said, “I just wish her well, frankly. I’ve met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, but I wish her well, whatever it is.” Mr. President, Ghislaine Maxwell has been arrested on allegations of child sex trafficking. Why would you wish such a person well?
President Donald J. Trump: (25:59)
Well, first of all, I don’t know that, but I do know this-
Jonathan Swan: (26:01)
She has. She’s been arrested for that. You know that.
President Donald J. Trump: (26:02)
Her friend or boyfriend-
Jonathan Swan: (26:04)
Epstein.
President Donald J. Trump: (26:05)
Was either killed or committed suicide in jail. She’s now in jail. Yeah, I wish you well, I’d wish you well, I’d wish a lot of people well. Good luck. Let them prove somebody was guilty. I mean, you do know that she [crosstalk 00:26:17]
Jonathan Swan: (26:17)
Oh. So you’re saying you hope she doesn’t die in jail? Is that what you mean by wish her well?
President Donald J. Trump: (26:20)
Well, her boyfriend died in jail and people are still trying to figure out how did it happened? Was it suicide? Was he killed? And I do wish her well. I’m not looking for anything bad for her. I’m not looking bad for anybody. And they took that and made it such a big deal-
Jonathan Swan: (26:32)
I mean, she’s a alleged child sex trafficker.
President Donald J. Trump: (26:35)
But all it is is her boyfriend died. He died in jail. Was he killed? Was it suicide? I do, I wish her well.
Jonathan Swan: (26:45)
Let’s move to Portland. I’m sure you’ve seen the disturbing footage of people in fatigues beating the Navy veteran.
President Donald J. Trump: (26:53)
No, no, no, no, no, no. No. No.
Jonathan Swan: (26:54)
Well, it’s there.
President Donald J. Trump: (26:55)
here you go, the fake news.
Jonathan Swan: (26:56)
It’s not fake news, it’s on video.
President Donald J. Trump: (26:58)
No, no.
Jonathan Swan: (26:58)
Pepper spraying him.
President Donald J. Trump: (26:59)
For 59 days, these people were anarchists and agitators, and some protesters, but these were anarchists. These people were beating the hell out of the city. They were beating up our federal buildings and our federal courthouse. We told the police to stop it. You make sure. And the police wouldn’t do it. Not the police-
Jonathan Swan: (27:17)
Your own justice department and Homeland Security Inspector General-
President Donald J. Trump: (27:19)
Excuse me.
Jonathan Swan: (27:19)
But your Inspector Generals are investigating unconstitutional-
President Donald J. Trump: (27:23)
You’re trying now to blame law enforcement instead of anarchists-
Jonathan Swan: (27:27)
I’m not.
President Donald J. Trump: (27:27)
Instead of Antifa.
Jonathan Swan: (27:29)
I’m not.
President Donald J. Trump: (27:29)
It’s Antifa and anarchists that are causing the problems, not law enforcement. Our law enforcement, if we didn’t have people at our courthouse, and they’re strong, tough people, and they don’t want… They try and be very good, believe me. But if we didn’t have people there, you would have your federal courthouse, a $600 million building, you would have that thing burned to the ground right now.
Jonathan Swan: (27:51)
I’m asking you about tactics and about the unmarked vans where they’re rounding people up. And I want to-
President Donald J. Trump: (27:55)
Okay, let me tell you about unmarked.
Jonathan Swan: (27:56)
Can I just finish my question.
President Donald J. Trump: (27:57)
Well let me tell you about unmarked.
Jonathan Swan: (27:58)
Could I just finish my question? Because it relates to this. I promise. This is from Rand Paul. “We cannot give up liberty for security. Local law enforcement can and should be handling these situations in our cities, but there is no place for federal troops or unidentified federal agents rounding people up at will.” What is your response to Senator Paul?
President Donald J. Trump: (28:16)
First of all, these are Homeland Security people. They’re securing a courthouse.
Jonathan Swan: (28:21)
They’re border patrol.
President Donald J. Trump: (28:22)
They’re Homeland Security.
Jonathan Swan: (28:24)
Elite units.
President Donald J. Trump: (28:24)
Border, hopefully they have ICE in there.
Jonathan Swan: (28:26)
Camo< gas [inaudible 00:28:26].
President Donald J. Trump: (28:26)
Hopefully they have ICE. Now, do you know why they’re unmarked?
Jonathan Swan: (28:29)
Why?
President Donald J. Trump: (28:30)
Because these terrorists, these Antifa people, these people that are at anarchists and agitators, when they see the name on a uniform of a person, a policeman or a law enforcement person, they find out where that person lives. And then they go and they scare the hell out of the person’s family. And so they do it for that reason. It’s just common… There’s nothing secret about this. And you know it.
President Donald J. Trump: (28:54)
You see what’s going on right now. We have Chad Wolf. They have people. He’s doing a fantastic job. He’s the acting head. He’s doing a fantastic job. Chad Wolf has pickets and very dangerous looking people outside of his house. He’s going to be just fine. He’s tough and he’s got people, but if you have the names on all of these uniforms, you’ll have these maniacs in front of their houses, scaring their family and their wives or husbands, whatever it may be. I think it’s a very good reason not to have your name. Why should you have identification? “My name is Bill Smith and here’s where I live and I’m a member of-”
Jonathan Swan: (29:33)
The really serious concern is the reports-
President Donald J. Trump: (29:34)
No, no, that’s a serious concern.
Jonathan Swan: (29:36)
No, no, not about that. The serious concern is the reports of people being rounded up and not being told why they’re being detained. That’s what’s being investigated by-
President Donald J. Trump: (29:42)
Why? Why are they being detained?
Jonathan Swan: (29:43)
Mr. President, the Inspectors Generals-
President Donald J. Trump: (29:45)
You know why? You know why they’re being detained? Well, [crosstalk 00:29:47].
Jonathan Swan: (29:48)
There’s an investigation. Do you support that investigation?
President Donald J. Trump: (29:50)
Well, I haven’t seen the result yet. Let me see the result.
Jonathan Swan: (29:51)
But you support the initiative of it?
President Donald J. Trump: (29:54)
No, I think that actually-
Jonathan Swan: (29:56)
You don’t?
President Donald J. Trump: (29:56)
I think Antifa should be investigated, not the law enforcement. They’re investigating, think of [crosstalk 00:30:01]
Jonathan Swan: (30:01)
They shouldn’t be investigating?
President Donald J. Trump: (30:02)
Have you been watching television-
President Donald J. Trump: (30:03)
They’re investigating-
Jonathan Swan: (30:03)
They shouldn’t be investigating?
President Donald J. Trump: (30:03)
Have you been watching television?
Jonathan Swan: (30:04)
I have.
President Donald J. Trump: (30:04)
Have you been seeing the violence?
Jonathan Swan: (30:06)
Sure.
President Donald J. Trump: (30:06)
Now, if you watch NBC News like I watch NBC fake news. I’m watching it. Lester Holt, real beauty. I’m watching this NBC News sham, and you have a mayor named Wheeler and he’s standing out there and he’s being accosted by the people. You know that. I mean, it’s horrible what they’re doing to him in Portland, the mayor of Portland and he thought he’d go out. He’d be a man.
President Donald J. Trump: (30:29)
What they were doing and saying, and everything else to him, I happened to watch it on a different station. He had to get out. He had five security guards.
Jonathan Swan: (30:36)
I saw it.
President Donald J. Trump: (30:36)
He got out with his life. Okay.
Jonathan Swan: (30:38)
Mr. President-
President Donald J. Trump: (30:38)
Wait. If you watch NBC News, they make them like he’s standing there bravely fighting with the people, in a positive sense, that everything is wonderful.
President Donald J. Trump: (30:48)
No. He went out there. He’s lucky he got away with his life because they would’ve killed him. He had five guards, but NBC News showed it like he’s standing with the people for justice. Look, those people, take a look at what they’ve done to the courthouse. Take a look at what they’ve done to the streets. Take a look at the violence.
Jonathan Swan: (31:06)
It’s getting worse since they’ve gone in. It’s getting worse.
President Donald J. Trump: (31:09)
Actually, it’s getting better. We had a very good… We’ve arrested a lot of people and we now have a 10 year rule. You try not to knock down our courthouse-
Jonathan Swan: (31:15)
More businesses damaged, more violence-
President Donald J. Trump: (31:17)
You touch our courthouse, you go to jail for 10 years.
Jonathan Swan: (31:19)
Turning to the rest of the country, we haven’t seen protests like this since the ’60s. I mean, we’re seeing-
President Donald J. Trump: (31:25)
These are Democrat-run cities.
Jonathan Swan: (31:26)
If I could finish my question. If I could finish my question.
President Donald J. Trump: (31:28)
And they’re doing it for political reasons.
Jonathan Swan: (31:30)
You said you’ve done so much for African Americans.
President Donald J. Trump: (31:32)
I have.
Jonathan Swan: (31:33)
But there are Americans-
President Donald J. Trump: (31:35)
Criminal justice reform, opportunity.
Jonathan Swan: (31:36)
Yeah, I understand, but let me finish. There were Americans out in the streets asking for change. Mr. President, have you ever met with a Black Lives Matter activist to hear them out, hear their arguments?
President Donald J. Trump: (31:46)
Well, Black Lives Matter started off to me very badly because it was-
Jonathan Swan: (31:50)
Did you ever meet with one?
President Donald J. Trump: (31:52)
… pigs in a blanket, burn them like bacon. That was the first time I ever of Black… That was three, four years ago. Pigs meaning policemen. Pigs is what they’re referring to, in a blanket, fry them like bacon. So I got off to a bad start. I got off to a very bad start.
Jonathan Swan: (32:11)
Would you meet with a-
President Donald J. Trump: (32:11)
And so did [crosstalk 00:32:12].
Jonathan Swan: (32:12)
Would you with a Black Lives Matter activist?
President Donald J. Trump: (32:13)
I would. But I think right now when they paint-
Jonathan Swan: (32:17)
Why haven’t you?
President Donald J. Trump: (32:17)
… the sign. Nobody’s asked for a meeting, right? I’ve never been, nobody’s ever asked me for a meeting. Let me tell you with African Americans, I’m doing very well. They had the best employment numbers they’ve ever had. They had the best job numbers they’ve ever had. They were making more money than they ever made. We were all set until we got hit by China with the virus. Jonathan, there was actually, we were becoming a very unified country.
Jonathan Swan: (32:39)
Do you believe that-
President Donald J. Trump: (32:40)
Because of success.
Jonathan Swan: (32:41)
I understand. Do you believe though, Mr. President, that many police treat black people differently from white people?
President Donald J. Trump: (32:48)
Well, I hope not. I hope not. Certainly the…
Jonathan Swan: (32:51)
You’ve seen the statistics.
President Donald J. Trump: (32:53)
The knee on the neck was a disgrace. Okay?
Jonathan Swan: (32:55)
Yeah.
President Donald J. Trump: (32:55)
It was a disgrace.
Jonathan Swan: (32:56)
I’m talking about what does systemic racism mean to you?
President Donald J. Trump: (33:00)
I hope the answer to that question is no. Does anybody really answer that question accurately? Does anybody really know?
Jonathan Swan: (33:08)
But what about not hope? What about analysis? What’s your cold-hearted view of it?
President Donald J. Trump: (33:10)
I have seen where there is a difference and I don’t want there to be a difference. I don’t like that there would be a difference. But with that being said-
Jonathan Swan: (33:18)
Why do you think Black men are two and a half times-
President Donald J. Trump: (33:19)
Police have killed white people-
Jonathan Swan: (33:21)
I know, but why do you think Black men-
President Donald J. Trump: (33:22)
… in larger number, police have killed white people.
Jonathan Swan: (33:25)
In quantity, but why do you think Black men are two and a half times more likely to be killed by police than white men?
President Donald J. Trump: (33:29)
That I don’t know-
Jonathan Swan: (33:30)
Why?
President Donald J. Trump: (33:30)
… but I don’t like it.
Jonathan Swan: (33:32)
But you must’ve thought about it.
President Donald J. Trump: (33:33)
I don’t know why, but I don’t like it. I do know this-
Jonathan Swan: (33:36)
Does it speak to something systemic?
President Donald J. Trump: (33:37)
… that police have killed many white people also.
Jonathan Swan: (33:39)
But proportionally, what does it speak to?
President Donald J. Trump: (33:42)
It speaks to something, if that’s the number?
Jonathan Swan: (33:45)
It is the number.
President Donald J. Trump: (33:45)
Okay. If that’s the number, it speaks to something that to me is unacceptable.
Jonathan Swan: (33:49)
And what do you do about it then?
President Donald J. Trump: (33:51)
Well, I think we’ve already done a lot of things-
Jonathan Swan: (33:52)
But you haven’t, it still exists.
President Donald J. Trump: (33:53)
Let me just tell you.
Jonathan Swan: (33:54)
No, no, I understand your achievements. I know what you’re going to say. I’m not suggesting you haven’t done a lot economically-
President Donald J. Trump: (33:58)
I’ve done a thing called criminal justice reform.
Jonathan Swan: (34:00)
I get it, I’m just saying what changes-
President Donald J. Trump: (34:01)
And your friend President Obama couldn’t get done.
Jonathan Swan: (34:02)
He’s not my friend. I’m asking about a statistic.
President Donald J. Trump: (34:04)
He tried, but he couldn’t get it done. I got criminal justice [crosstalk 00:34:07]-
Jonathan Swan: (34:07)
I get it. I get it.
President Donald J. Trump: (34:07)
I got opportunities on, I took care of the historically Black… If you look at what I’ve done for colleges, for Black colleges and universities, I got them funding. Obama never did it. I did more for the Black community than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, whether you like it or not. People say, “Oh, that’s interesting.”
Jonathan Swan: (34:31)
You really believe you did more than Lyndon Johnson who passed the Civil Rights Act?
President Donald J. Trump: (34:34)
I think I did, yeah.
Jonathan Swan: (34:34)
How? How possibly did you-
President Donald J. Trump: (34:36)
Because I got criminal justice reform done, I got prison reform-
Jonathan Swan: (34:38)
Lyndon Johnson-
President Donald J. Trump: (34:39)
I’ve done things. Well-
Jonathan Swan: (34:41)
He passed the Civil Rights Act.
President Donald J. Trump: (34:43)
Ask. Ask. How has it worked out? If you take a look at what Lyndon Johnson did?
Jonathan Swan: (34:46)
You think the Civil Rights Act was a mistake?
President Donald J. Trump: (34:46)
How has it worked out? Because frankly, it took a long time, but for African Americans-
Jonathan Swan: (34:53)
But you think that was a mistake?
President Donald J. Trump: (34:54)
… under my administration, Jonathan, under my administration, African Americans were doing better than they have ever done in the history of this country. So I did a lot, job numbers, all of it, money. They had money, they were getting great. Their percentage was up, their housing ownership was up. They did better than they’ve ever done until we got hit-
Jonathan Swan: (35:12)
I just don’t know how you can-
President Donald J. Trump: (35:13)
… and now you know what we’re doing? I’m building it up again. We’re going to have it. Next year will be a great year, unless it’s screwed up by somebody that doesn’t know what he’s doing, which could happen, but I don’t think it will.
Jonathan Swan: (35:24)
John Lewis is lying in state in the U.S. Capitol. How do you think history will remember John Lewis?
President Donald J. Trump: (35:29)
I don’t know. I really don’t know. I don’t know. I don’t know John Lewis. He chose not to come to my inauguration. He chose… I never met John Lewis, actually, I don’t believe.
Jonathan Swan: (35:42)
Do you find him impressive?
President Donald J. Trump: (35:46)
I can’t say one or the other. I find a lot of people impressive. I find many people not impressive. But no, but I didn’t go-
Jonathan Swan: (35:52)
Do you find his story impressive?
President Donald J. Trump: (35:53)
He didn’t come to my inauguration. He didn’t come to my State of the Union speeches, and that’s okay. That’s his right. And again, nobody has done more-
Jonathan Swan: (36:02)
Right, but back-
President Donald J. Trump: (36:03)
… for Black Americans than I have.
Jonathan Swan: (36:05)
I understand.
President Donald J. Trump: (36:05)
He should’ve come. I think he made a big mistake by not showing up.
Jonathan Swan: (36:08)
But taking your relationship with him out of it, do you find his story impressive? What he’s done for this country?
President Donald J. Trump: (36:14)
He was a person that devoted a lot of energy and a lot of heart to civil rights, but there were many others also.
Jonathan Swan: (36:23)
There’s a petition to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama as the John Lewis Bridge. Would you support that idea?
President Donald J. Trump: (36:32)
I would have no objection to it if they’ve like to do it.
Jonathan Swan: (36:34)
Yeah? It’s a good idea?
President Donald J. Trump: (36:34)
Would have no objection to it whatsoever.
Jonathan Swan: (36:36)
Mr. President, you’ve been so generous with your time and we really appreciate.
President Donald J. Trump: (36:39)
Well, thank you very much. Great honor.
Jonathan Swan: (36:40)
Thank you so much.
President Donald J. Trump: (36:41)
Thank you.
Speaker 1: (36:45)
Okay, thank you.
President Donald J. Trump: (36:46)
Thank you very much.
Jonathan Swan: (36:47)
Thank you, sir."
"Aug 3, 2020",5:41 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
I want to start by providing information on our response to Tropical Storm Isaias. It’s a very interesting name. Last week, the storm hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I’ve issued emergency declarations to support our response in both of those areas. So that’s Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. This week, the storm passed just east of Florida. Got a little bit lucky, didn’t hit Florida too hard. Working with the governor, working with everybody, but it did not hit directly as a lot of people thought it might. It’s currently off the coast of South Carolina heading northward to North Carolina, is expected to make landfall sometime this evening as a Category 1 hurricane, very serious, a lot of water, a lot of water coming from that storm. I’ve already issued emergency declarations for Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, and FEMA’s personnel, and they are great, they’re doing a job. They’re already on the ground in all areas. Every single area that we mentioned just covered.
Donald Trump: (01:06)
Over the next several days, there’s expected to be heavy wind and rain in the coastal areas of North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey. We’re working with each of those states. And in particular, as it relates to FEMA, the military, law enforcement, all of the different groups that are involved, storm surge and inland flooding are possible and everyone needs to remain vigilant until it passes. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines of the state and local authorities. We’re working with them. And I think the guidelines have been very accurate so far. So stay safe.
Donald Trump: (01:45)
Next let me provide an update on the path forward for our country as we continue our war to defeat the China virus. We’re beginning to see evidence of significant progress. Nationwide, the number of positive cases has declined by nearly 6% from the week before. And the positive test rate is also dropped from 8.7% to 8% over that same period of time, an encouraging sign, very encouraging. I have to add that the virus is receding in hotspots across the south and west. We’ve seen slow improvements from their recent weekly peaks. Arizona’s weekly case counts have dropped 37%. That’s a tremendous drop and the governor and the state have done a fantastic job, down 37%. Texas down 18.7%. I was there a couple of days ago. And Florida 21.2% drop. So that’s a tremendous job that they’re all doing.
Donald Trump: (02:47)
As we begin to contain the virus in these states, we must focus on new flare ups in the states where the case numbers have risen, including Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Missouri and I think you’ll find that they’re soon going to be very much under control. Meanwhile, 18 states continue to have very low case numbers and low test positivity rates under 5%: Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. It’s under five.
Donald Trump: (03:26)
Even in these states, however, where the virus is under control and at a very low number, Americans should continue to be vigilant, be careful in order to prevent the new hotspots from opening up or any new hotspots from opening up in those states. To that end, I urge all Americans to continue to socially distance, wash your hands, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places and to protect the elderly. Very, very important, protect the elderly. It’s much different. Young children have very strong immune systems. We’ve learned how strong they are, but protect the elderly. The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. That’s the average age.
Donald Trump: (04:13)
It’s important for all Americans to recognize that a permanent lockdown is not a viable path toward producing the result that you want, or certainly not a viable path forward and would ultimately inflict more harm than it would prevent. As we’re seeing in foreign countries around the world, where cases are once again surging, you have many places where we thought they were under control and doing a great job, and they are doing a great job, but this is a very tough invisible enemy.
Donald Trump: (04:47)
Lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future. They just don’t. It comes back, many times it comes back. The purpose of a lockdown is to buy time to build capacity, especially with respect to hospitals, learn more about the disease and develop effective treatments as we did in the United States. We’re doing very well with the vaccines and the therapeutics. Countries where there have been very significant flare ups over the last short period of time are Spain, Germany, France, Australia, Japan. And also, as you probably heard in Hong Kong, they’ve had some very serious flare ups. Japan has gone, yeah, a lot of six fold flare up. It’s a lot, but they’ll get it under control.
Donald Trump: (05:37)
In our current phase, we must focus on protecting those at highest risk while allowing younger and healthier Americans to resume work and school with careful precautions. Ideally, we want to open those schools. We want to open them. At the same time, we’re placing an emphasis on continuing to drive down the mortality rate with improved care, treatment and medical interventions, building a bridge to the introduction of a vaccine. The vaccines are coming along incredibly well. Today I’d like to also provide an update on the actions of my administration and the work that we’ve done. We’re really taking an increased interest and we’re seeing numbers that nobody can even believe in terms of percentage increase. It’s telehealth for American patients. The percentage increase is being worked on right now, but it’s very, very significant, numbers that you would not even think possible. This has been a priority from the beginning of my administration when we launched an initiative to allow veterans to connect remotely with their VA healthcare team. And it worked out really well.
Donald Trump: (06:47)
We have a 91% approval rating in the VA in terms of the job we’re doing. It’s the first, it’s the highest ever recorded. Now telehealth is a critical part of our path forward in the VA. And it’s becoming a critical path, especially with our senior citizens. You don’t have to go to the doctor’s office. You don’t have to go to hospitals.
Donald Trump: (07:06)
When the invisible enemy struck our shores, I took immediate action to eliminate regulatory barriers to telehealth, making it easier for patients to consult with doctors from safety and convenience, and really they have great safety and great convenience right from their homes. Today I’m taking action to ensure telehealth is here to stay. Moments ago in the Oval Office, I signed an executive order to make many of our regulatory reforms permanent. We’ve done some regulatory reforms that have had a tremendous impact on what we’re doing, on medicine and medical and what we’re doing. We can do things that you wouldn’t believe, that even a year ago, two years ago, would not have been doable.
Donald Trump: (07:53)
We’re enshrining the right of American patients to meet with their medical providers in a way that is best for them and very, very convenient and very talented people on the other side of the line, I have to tell you. The order builds upon a series of actions we’ve all taken to make telehealth available to all. We ensured that Medicare covers telehealth visits at no additional cost. That’s no additional cost. And copayments can be waived for telehealth services. We are working very hard also on prescription drug prices. And I will tell you that the Favorite Nations Clause that I’ve signed into existence, nobody thought anybody would ever do that, has a massive impact on prescription drug prices. In addition to the three other elements of reduction of drugs, particular prescription drugs, but the Favorite Nations Clause is massive.
Donald Trump: (08:55)
For instance, if Germany buys a pill for 25 cents a pill, as an example, just as an example, and the United States pays $2 for the same pill, we get the same privilege, the same right, as they do. Never had that before. We paid all of the expenses, all of the research and development. So the numbers are astronomical. And as you probably noticed, big ads are taken against me by big pharma, very big ads, very massive buy. But in the meantime, they’re calling, they want to know if they can make a deal. And I say to people, the only reason these ads are being taken is because prices are coming down for you. And they understand that. I think our people understand that.
Donald Trump: (09:37)
But in particular, when you look at the matching, you could call it matching, or you could call it Favorite Nations, call it whatever you like. It’s going to have a tremendous, and I’m talking about 50%, 60%, 70%. That doesn’t mean it goes to 25 cents, as an example, but theirs comes up and ours goes down. And you have many, many countries where the numbers are so low. I mean, it’s…
Donald Trump: (10:03)
… but the numbers are so low. I mean, so low. And by that, I mean much lower than the United States. Another thing I’m doing is if a certain country like Canada, Canada buys for very much less than United States has bought. How they allowed this to happen, representatives of our country, standing at these podiums or in the Oval Office, how they allowed this to happen is just, to me, incredible. We’ve been working on this for a long time. I’ve been talking about it with Kayleigh for a long time, right? So now a governor like Ron DeSantis of Florida is doing a great job, or our great governor of Ohio, or our great governor of any state can call up and buy the drugs directly from Canada, at sometimes 50% less. So we’ll be buying from Canada. Now what the drug companies are going to do, maybe they’ll raise them, maybe they’ll lower them, or maybe they’ll just give up and sell them to us directly, much cheaper.
Donald Trump: (10:59)
So a lot of things that are happening. Also, the rebate, we have people that are very wealthy, that nobody ever heard of them, nobody knows who they are. I guess in some cases they can be pharmacies. In some cases, they’re individuals. We’re doing a rebate and the rebate goes to the people that lowers the price of drugs. So we have a series of four things that we signed, and you will see over a fairly short period, drug prices are going to be tumbling down, at numbers that nobody would have ever believed possible. In 51 years, the only time prices came down was during this administration. It was last year, 51 years, it went up. But that was just a small decline, this is a massive decline. This is a decline that nobody can believe. I was called by senators. I was called by congressmen, “Please don’t do this.” But big pharma doesn’t mean anything to me, other than we want them to do a great job. We want them to get their vaccines. We want them to do what has to be done.
Donald Trump: (12:02)
So I think you’re going to see drug price reductions over the next four or five or six months. Probably take a little while to kick in, then they’re going to be at numbers that you wouldn’t believe. But in the meantime, they called on Friday afternoon, they want to meet, see if they can do something else. They don’t like favorite nations clauses, I understand that. We vastly expanded coverage, allowing Medicare to cover more than 135 new services through telehealth, by the way, including physical therapy, emergency department visits, home visits, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, which is a very big priority. We brought the substance abuse, at least prior to the China plague or whatever you want to call it, we brought it down very substantially. Pediatric critical care and much more. Thanks to our actions, an estimated $2 billion of additional funding will support Medicare patients receiving telehealth services. So a very, very big priority on tele-health.
Donald Trump: (13:03)
As part of the CARES Act, we secured $200 million to help healthcare providers and hospitals expand their telehealth. And they’re all doing it, they’re doing it gladly. Prior to the epidemic or the pandemic, whatever you want to say and how you want to refer to it. But prior to the pandemic, the telehealth was fine, but it wasn’t anything raging. And I guess one of the only good things that we’ve gotten out of this whole horrible situation is telehealth has been incredible. And again, the increases are many hundreds of times greater than it was before. Do you have a number? It’s like 2000% or something like that. It’s an incredible increase. You’ll get the number, but it’s… I think they have it now finally. And it’s really an incredible… Thank you, Kayleigh.
Donald Trump: (13:58)
We work with the leaders of major health insurance companies to ensure coverage for the telehealth visits related to coronavirus. We cut red tape to allow many services to be conducted by phone rather than video, which is much simpler, providing a much easier option for many seniors in particular. 35% of the Medicare beneficiaries who received telehealth services, or over 3.6 million seniors, did so over the phone. So you’re talking about 3.6 million seniors, that’s something. 10.1 million Medicare beneficiaries have accessed care through telehealth since the beginning of the pandemic. So you’re talking there, 10.1 million people. In April, over 43% of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth and compared to less than a 0.1% in February. Those are part of the numbers that I think I’ll have you get them. So this part you don’t have to, you’ll get the the other section. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (15:06)
So think of that, compared to less than 0.1%. 0.1%, that’s an incredible number. So over 43% of all Medicare primary care visits were done via telehealth compared to… So you went from 0.1% to 43%. It’s an incredible number. The executive order I signed today will also expand healthcare access in rural America. We take care of rural America. It directs agencies to deploy strategic investments in our rural communications infrastructure. And we’re working very hard with all of the people in government that are involved with the communications infrastructure, so that the telehealth gets very quick and easy access. Additionally, revenue for rural providers varies significantly from month to month, making it difficult for many to stay in business. Many, many are having a very difficult time. To help fix this problem, my order will create a voluntary Medicare payment system that will give rural hospitals flexibility, really great flexibility and a more consistent income stream to better serve their patients.
Donald Trump: (16:21)
Furthermore, I am directing the Department of Agriculture, Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Communications Commission… We were just with the heads of each one in the Oval Office, just before I came up to the podium. To form a task force that will break down barriers to expanding rural healthcare. This order continues my administration’s focus on rural healthcare. We allocated nearly $165 million through the CARES Act to support nearly 1,800 small rural hospitals, who have done an incredible job, as well as $11.5 million to expand technical assistance for rural and underserved areas. We allocated another $10 billion to 2000 rural hospitals, and more than 2,400 rural health clinics. We waived burdensome licensing certification and registration requirements, which took tremendous amounts of time. And these are people that had great reputations and great track records, for practitioners that serve on the front lines in rural areas, allowing more medical personnel to serve their wonderful patients.
Donald Trump: (17:37)
We’re also, in terms of PPE, ensuring that the state and local areas have the supplies they need. We’ve been supplying hospitals and cities and states, governors, helping governors at a number that nobody’s ever heard of before. 15,440 nursing homes have received a second shipment of personal protective equipment. They’re very much stocked up. They’re in great shape. They all have the ventilators, all the ventilators they need. They have actually more than they need. And their medical equipment is in very, very good shape. They’re full. My administration has worked with the private sector to deliver over 100 million N95 respirators, 85 million gloves and nearly 250 million face coverings nationwide. We continue to make the extraordinary progress that we’ve been talking about together on vaccines and treatments under Operation Warp Speed, which is very exciting, most exciting.
Donald Trump: (18:39)
Last week we distributed 2,979 cases of remdesivir, which is proving to be extremely powerful and good, enough to treat more than 19,000 patients, had great results. This includes 500 cases for Florida, 500 for Texas, 300 for California, 200 for Ohio, and 150 for Arizona and Georgia. And those numbers will be going up rapidly as we move along. Hospitals are reporting an adequate supply of steroids, such as dexamethasone, that are used successfully in late stage illness. They’ve been very good. We’re also very encouraged about the prospects for plasma therapies that we’re working on. And that’s a brilliant art. It’s really an art. And we launched a national plasma drive last week. I was at the Red Cross building with the American Red Cross and 13 other healthcare organizations. I urge everyone who has recovered from the virus to go to coronavirus.gov, coronavirus.gov, and donate plasma today. We would really appreciate it. This really makes people better. But what we need is, we need that beautiful ingredient, that you that got better, seem to have in your…
Donald Trump: (20:03)
… be it that you that got better seem to have in your veins, you have to go to coronavirus.gov and donate plasma today. It would be tremendous. We really appreciate it if you do it because we’re low. We’re low. We could help a lot more people, and it would be a terrific thing. It’ll take an hour, maybe a little bit more than an hour, but everybody will be very appreciative. It makes people better. You had something very special, you had something that knocked it out, so we want to be able to use it. So whatever you can do, coronavirus.gov.
Donald Trump: (20:35)
As a result of improvements we’ve made in treatment for Americans over the age of 18, the mortality rate has declined 85% from its April peak, 85% decline.
Donald Trump: (20:48)
On vaccines, last week we announced a $2.1 billion partnership with Sanofi and GSX to purchase and produce 100 million doses of their coronavirus vaccine, 100 million doses. This is the sixth vaccine candidate we are proactively supporting. We are supporting numerous companies that are doing very well, having wonderful results, and they’re in final stages of testing. There are now two vaccines in that final stage of clinical trials in America with a third vaccine likely to begin phase three almost immediately. We have additional clinical trials scheduled over the next few weeks for a couple of the other companies. These are great companies. These are companies that are not only well-known, they’re well-respected, most importantly.
Donald Trump: (21:41)
We’re balancing speed and safety, and we’re on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year. We’re mass producing the most promising candidates in advance so that we’re ready immediately upon approval. We have our military lined up. It’s logistics. It’s all about logistics. They deliver a lot of things, including soldiers, but now they’ll be doing vaccine. Our general is all ready to go, and he’s very excited. Once we have the vaccine approved, fully approved, he’ll start the process. They will start the process, and they’ll get it out very, very quickly all over the country, and maybe beyond if it works as we think it probably will.
Donald Trump: (22:24)
By unleashing America’s technical and scientific brilliance, we will end this pandemic, and we will hopefully end it very quickly. The therapeutics are very exciting to me, where you can go into a hospital, and whether it’s through a shot or a transfusion, you take care of somebody and they get better. That’s something to me that’s very important. We’re doing really well on therapeutics and really well on vaccines.
Donald Trump: (22:49)
So thank you all very much for being here. We’ll take a couple of questions.
Speaker 1: (22:53)
Hey, Mr. President. If I could ask your response to two items in the news and ask a couple question. First, have you been briefed on the incident off the coast of California, where the Marines and the Navy [inaudible 00:23:06] died in a training accident a couple [crosstalk 00:23:11]
Donald Trump: (23:10)
They’re actually briefing me in a little while. We have it scheduled for a little while from now.
Speaker 1: (23:16)
[crosstalk 00:23:16] speak to the families?
Donald Trump: (23:17)
Oh, it’s terrible. No, it’s terrible, and we’ll be in contact with the families. A thing like that is terrible.
Speaker 1: (23:23)
Secondly, in New York today, there’s a city prosecutor that confirmed a criminal investigation into the Trump organization. Do you have any reaction to that?
Donald Trump: (23:32)
Well, I just heard about it. This is just a continuation of the witch hunt. It’s Democrat stuff. They failed with Mueller. They failed with everything. They failed with Congress. They failed at every stage of the game. This has been going on for three and a half, four years. Even before I got in, this was starting with the Mueller deal. Mueller started a little bit after, but it started with some of the people that you know very well the names, Strzok and Page and all of the different people, Comey. This has been going on. This is a continuation of the worst witch hunt in American history, and there’s nothing that I know even about it.
Donald Trump: (24:11)
I had seen that today just a little while ago. I said, “What’s this all about?” I know nothing about it, but it’s just a continuation of the witch hunt. Didn’t work out for Congress, didn’t work out for Mueller, didn’t work out for anybody. So what they’re doing is they send them around to all over the country, I guess maybe, but it’s a terrible thing that they do. It’s really a terrible thing. The witch hunt has gone on long enough. What else?
Speaker 1: (24:34)
Just one on COVID, you mentioned the vaccine development program. Could you assure the American people that politics and considerations around the election will not interfere with the science?
Donald Trump: (24:45)
Absolutely not. Absolutely.
Speaker 1: (24:46)
Do you plan on playing a role in determining how the vaccine, if there is one, will be distributed across the country? Is that something that you will be doing [crosstalk 00:24:52]
Donald Trump: (24:52)
It’s possible that I get involved; but no, it won’t have anything to do with … We want to make people better. We want to send them to the areas that most need it, and I think we’re going to have something very soon. It’s going good. Jeff [inaudible 00:25:02]
Jeff: (25:03)
Mr. President, you said today, this week that Dr. Birx was taking bait from Speaker Pelosi. What did you mean by that considering that she was just describing the facts about the case of the pandemic right now across the country?
Donald Trump: (25:15)
I think we’re doing very well, and I think that we have done as well as any nation. If you really look, if you take a look at what’s going on, especially now with all these flareups and nations that they were talking about. Don’t forget, we’re much bigger, other than India and China. China’s having a massive flareup right down. India has a tremendous problem. Other countries have problems. I noticed that in the news, in the evening news, I never read about that in any of the news. I don’t read about the other countries. You’re starting to see that other countries are having very big flareups, countries that thought they were over it. Like we thought we might be over it in Florida; and then all of a sudden, it comes back. They do come back, but I think we’re doing very well. I told Dr. Birx, I think we’re doing very well. She was in my office a little while ago. She’s a person I have a lot of respect for. I think Nancy Pelosi’s treated her very badly, very, very badly, very nasty. I’m just referring to the fact that I thought that really they should say the job we’ve done, whether it’s on ventilators or testing, we’ve tested now over 60 million people. No other country is even close to that. We’ve tested 60 million people with great … In many cases, about 50% now, rapid fire, meaning 5 to 15 to 20-minute tests, where you get the result almost immediately. Nobody has anything like that. Nobody. I think we’re just doing very well.
Speaker 3: (26:40)
[inaudible 00:26:41].
Donald Trump: (26:40)
Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 3: (26:42)
Just to follow up just quickly.
Donald Trump: (26:43)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 3: (26:43)
Does that mean you disagree with her characterization, Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (26:46)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 2: (26:47)
Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to follow up on two things that you had said earlier in the cabinet room. The first was on TikTok, and the second was on coronavirus. On TikTok, you said that you wanted money for the US Treasury from the sale. Does that mean you expect the Chinese company to pay the US Treasury directly? Or are you talking about [crosstalk 00:27:08]
Donald Trump: (27:08)
Either way, whether it’s Microsoft or somebody else, or it was the Chinese. What the price is, the United States should get a very large percentage of that price because we’re making it possible. Without us, I use the expression, it’s like the landlord and the tenant. Without the lease, the tenant doesn’t have the value. Well, we’re in a certain way, the lease. We make it possible to have this great success. TikTok’s a tremendous success, but a big portion of it’s in this country.
Speaker 4: (27:37)
So from the sale directly, it would come [crosstalk 00:27:38]
Donald Trump: (27:39)
It would come from the sale. Yeah, whatever the number is, it would come from the sale,-
Speaker 4: (27:41)
Then you mentioned-
Donald Trump: (27:41)
… which nobody else would be thinking about, but me. But that’s the way I think. I think it’s very fair.
Speaker 4: (27:47)
And you mentioned-
Donald Trump: (27:47)
But we want no security problems with China. It’s got to be an American company. It’s got to be American security. It’s got to be owned here. We don’t want to have any problems with security, etc. Something could come out. I will tell you, there’s a lot of excitement, not only by Microsoft, but by other companies in terms of buying it. We’ll see what happens, but we want, and we think we deserve, to have a big percentage of that price coming to America, coming to the Treasury.
Speaker 4: (28:14)
Then on the negotiation on Capitol Hill, you expressed some frustration and said you might take executive action to address-
Donald Trump: (28:21)
I might do that. Yes.
Speaker 4: (28:23)
So I was wondering if you could talk about both how you might prevent evictions through executive action, and then also-
Donald Trump: (28:29)
Yeah, I can do that if I want, and I want to do that. I don’t want people to be evicted. When they’re evicted, when they’re thrown out of whatever the place may be, in many cases, they go to big shelters. If you talk about pandemic, this is a pandemic, and they go to shelters. Number one, they’re thrown out viciously. It’s not their fault. It’s China’s fault. It’s not anybody’s fault. It’s China’s fault. But number two, and if they are thrown out, they oftentimes will go to a shelter with tremendous numbers of other people, and the virus will spread. We don’t want that.
Speaker 4: (29:05)
Are you considering suspending the collection of payroll taxes?
Donald Trump: (29:09)
Well, I can do that also through an executive order. So we’ll be talking about that. But we’re having a very good discussion with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.
Donald Trump: (29:16)
The problem is they want to do bailouts of their various Democrat-run states and cities. They want a lot of money. They want a trillion dollars for that. They want to do much more than COVID-related. They want to bail out cities and states that have been in trouble for years of bad management. In all cases, Democrat-run cities, and we don’t think that’s fair. You understand that. You’ve heard it before.
Donald Trump: (29:42)
Yeah, please. Go ahead.
Speaker 5: (29:42)
Thanks, Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about the Justice Department sending federal agents into cities like Chicago as part of Operation Legend. How exactly do you envision these federal forces working alongside local police departments to help stop violent crime?
Donald Trump: (29:58)
It’s not a mass send, but it’s sending very talented people to help them with the drugs and the shootings and the gun-
Donald Trump: (30:03)
… So sending very talented people to help them with the drugs and the shootings and the guns and the things that are happening. It’s not like sending in the National Guard and stopping it cold, which is an example. A lot of progress has been made in Portland, but you know, frankly, sending in the National Guard like we did in Minneapolis, it stopped it cold. From the time we sent that National Guard, they walked down the street, it was over in Minneapolis. Now it may be starting up again. These are Democrat run cities and states and it hasn’t been a pretty picture to watch.
Donald Trump: (30:33)
We will help Chicago. We’ll help New York if they request. They have to request the help but we want to stop the drugs. We want to stop the guns. A lot of the Chicago is guns and what it is, is drug related; gang related, largely gang related. With ICE, we send out thousands of MS-13. Thousands and thousands of MS-13. We send them back or in some cases have to put them in prison. They’re too violent. They’re truly violent. So we’re helping out.
Donald Trump: (31:01)
When you look at what’s happening in Chicago and some other cities with the shootings and the killings, they need help and we haven’t met with resistance, I have to be honest with you. I think it’s good that we haven’t. We’re only looking to help them. We’re only looking to help.
Speaker 6: (31:16)
Thank you, Mr. President. In our nations 243 year history, there has never been a stronger push for mail-in ballots to determine a national election. Are you considering at any point issuing an executive order addressing mail-in ballots and why do you think some people are pushing it so hard?
Donald Trump: (31:38)
Well, there’s never been a push like this for mail-in ballots and if you look at the New York congressional race, which is a disaster. Carolyn, it’s been a total disaster. They’re six weeks into it. Now they have no clue what’s going on and I mean, I think I can say right here and now I think you have to rerun that race because it’s a mess. Nobody knows what’s happening with the ballots and the lost ballots and the fraudulent ballots, I guess.
Donald Trump: (32:07)
I think you’ve probably have to take the Carolyn Maloney race and run it over again. How can you do this? This is a small race with literally thousands of people, small thousands, and it’s all messed up. You look at Patterson, New Jersey. It’s all messed up. Almost every one of these and these are small, easy to control. They should be able to do this easy.
Donald Trump: (32:27)
Now you’re talking about like Nevada, where last two nights ago, they went out and in the darkness of night without people, without having any meetings of the public, without having anything, they approved the ridiculous you don’t have to look at signatures. You don’t have to approve anything. You can have double mailings. You can have all sorts of things. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. It’s a disgrace. I mean, honestly, it’s a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (32:53)
So it’s a very good question. I mean, the mail in ballots, if you look at just some of the small places, the small races, congressional race in New York, should be very easy. Normally that would have been announced at seven o’clock and it would have been down to the wire and everybody would have loved it. If it was at all complex, it would have taken an extra 45 minutes or an hour. They would have announced it a little bit later. They have no clue. This was about six weeks ago and they have no clue what’s going on. They’ve lost ballots. There’s fraudulent ballots. It’s how are you going to do you do that for an entire nation? They’re using COVID to try and get the mail-in ballots. Now, absentee ballots are great. Absentee ballots, you have to request them. They go through a process. They get them. But the universal mail-in ballots have turned out to be a disaster.
Donald Trump: (33:48)
What Nevada has been doing, if you look over the last few days, you have to look at what they’ve done. You can have two ballots. You can harvest; it’s harvesting. So you can take thousands of ballots, put them together and just dump them down on somebody’s desk after a certain period of time.
Donald Trump: (34:06)
They have something where if you vote, the vote can count up to seven days later. Well, if the vote is going to count seven days later, that means, if it depends on the one state like Nevada, that would mean simply that you can’t have, supposing it’s down to that one state, it could be. It’s a great state. But supposing is down to that one state. That means you have to wait seven days but they won’t have it there. This is something that’s so messed up.
Donald Trump: (34:33)
By the way, I have to say the post office for many, many years has been run in a fashion that hasn’t been great. Great workers and everything but they have old equipment, very old equipment. I don’t think the post office is prepared for a thing like this. You have to ask the people at the post office but how can the post office be expected to handle? They have regular mailing and then now on top of that, they have the internet where you have Amazon and these companies doing all the buying instead of going to a department store, they go buy through mail.
Donald Trump: (35:06)
So you have massive numbers of purchases now going through the post office, purchases of items and gifts and that’s a tremendous strain on the post office. The post office loses a fortune. It has been for many, many years, for decades. So now on top of it, it has this and the Amazons of the world and the others they pay very, very little money. They lose money on every… The post office loses money which is ridiculous on every package that delivers.
Donald Trump: (35:33)
Now, on top of that, and I’m not just referring to Amazon, I’m talking about all of the competitors, if there is such a thing to Amazon. It will be. But if there is such a thing, but now on top of that, you’ll have somebody like the governor of Nevada, come out with this massive plan out of nowhere to take millions of ballots and send them all over the place. You’ll never know who won that state. It’ll get messed up just like New York and just like Patterson, New Jersey, and just like many other places.
Donald Trump: (36:05)
In West Virginia, they indicted a postman for doing something very bad, you know that, but there are many cases all over the country. If you look, you’ll be able to find there’s a list of them all over the country and that has to do with universal mailing.
Donald Trump: (36:21)
Again, absentee is great. It works. Like in Florida, they’ll do absentee. It really works but universal mail-in ballots is going to be a great embarrassment to our country.
Donald Trump: (36:35)
Well, I have the right to do it. We haven’t gotten there yet, but we’ll see what happens. We will be suing in Nevada and that’s already been taken care of. We’ll probably file something tomorrow.
Donald Trump: (36:46)
I do want to say that we’re going to be introducing a tremendous healthcare plan sometime prior, hopefully prior to the end of the month. It’s just about completed now. In addition, next month we’ll be doing the immigration plan. So we’ll be doing that in September. We’ll be doing sometime during this month, the healthcare plan and I think that’ll be before the end of the month and I think it will be very impressive to a lot of people. Thank you very much."

We’re working with representatives of DACA, and we’re also working on a big immigration bill, which is merit-based and something that people are going to be very happy with. We’re doing a very big immigration bill and we’re doing a very big healthcare bill. The other thing we’re working on very strongly, and it’s very important, is prescription drug prices. The drug companies are not exactly happy. In fact, I assume they’ll be taking ads. But we’re doing a drug prescription bill, in a sense. We’ve already signed it for the most part. One goes into effect very soon, that’s going to get us to be tied with or lower than the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world. Right now, the United States, because of what has happened over years, we have the highest prescription drug prices in the world. We will soon have the lowest.

Suburban lifestyle dream, why would low income housing in the suburbs destroy the suburban lifestyle dream?
Donald Trump: (02:55)
So we ended a rule that was a very horrible rule for people in suburbia and the suburbs. That rule has been a very unfair rule for a long time, and it was going to be made a lot worse by Biden and Cory Booker. It’s a rule that basically you build low-income housing and you build other forms of housing. Also having to do with zoning and destroy people that have lived in communities in suburbia for years, they’ve lived there and they want to destroy their lives and destroy what they have. That has been going on for a long time. I ended the rule, so people living in the suburbs will no longer have that problem. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Reporters: (03:36)
[crosstalk 00:03:36] they share the dream, sir.

Are you worried Herman Cain caught COVID in Tulsa? [crosstalk 00:03:39]
Donald Trump: (03:42)
Herman Cain was a great man. He did a fantastic job. He was respected by everybody. He was loved by everybody, and we will miss Herman Cain.
Reporters: (03:51)
[crosstalk 00:03:51] Are you worried he caught COVID in Tulsa?

"Jul 31, 2020",5:20 P.M. EDT,"President Donald Trump: (00:12)
Thank you very much, and thank you for being here to discuss the relentless work that we’re doing to defeat the China virus and protect the people of Florida. Great state. Just got the endorsement of the sheriffs, and they are amazing people. The law enforcement in Florida is very, very, very first grade. We appreciate that endorsement in particular.
President Donald Trump: (00:35)
First, I want to provide a update to our response and on our response to hurricane. So the hurricane is a … I’m not sure it’s a hurricane yet. Right now-
Speaker 1: (00:45)
[crosstalk 00:00:45].
President Donald Trump: (00:45)
… it’s sort of projected as a storm/hurricane, right? What’s going to happen? Is that looking like a hurricane to you, Ron?
Ron DeSantis: (00:52)
I think that it did reach category one status, but it’s kind of right at the border.
President Donald Trump: (00:56)
Let’s keep it there. Let’s not let it get any bigger. But it’s pretty severe nevertheless. A lot of water coming in. It’s approach approaching the Florida coast. The storm’s already passed through Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and I’ve approved emergency declarations for both of those areas.
President Donald Trump: (01:11)
FEMA is closely coordinating with Florida, with your governor, happens to be on my right. Good job, by the way, Ron. You’re doing a great job. And we’re in constant contact with Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and anybody else that may have a problem. But we think it’s going to work out very well. We have FEMA all set to go. In some of those states, they were already there.
President Donald Trump: (01:35)
I ask all of those in the path of the storm to follow the guidance of your state, local, and tribal officials. My administration will be here for you every single step of the way. We’ve done everything we can do, and now we’re just waiting for the storm. And I guess it’s right behind me. It’s following me.
President Donald Trump: (01:53)
We’re grateful to be joined by Health and Human Services’ Secretary is doing a fantastic job on COVID or whatever you want to call it. There are many different names. All we know is it came from China, and they shouldn’t have let it happen. But Alex Azar is here. Thank you, Alex, very much. Governor Ron DeSantis doing a fantastic job. Thank you. Previous Governor and now Senator Rick Scott. He’s representing Florida very well in Washington. And I just spoke with Marco Rubio, and likewise he’s doing a great job, and he sends his regards. State Senator Wilton Simpson. Thank you very much, Senator. Great job you’re doing. State Representative Daniel Perez. Daniel, thank you, Daniel, very much.
Daniel Perez: (02:37)
Thank you, Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (02:37)
Pinellas County Commissioner Kathleen Peters.
Kathleen Peters: (02:41)
Good to see you.
President Donald Trump: (02:41)
Hi, Kathy. Thanks very much. And CEO, Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida, Justin Senior. Thank you. Thank you, Justin, very much, very much for being here.
President Donald Trump: (02:52)
We continue to take very aggressive action to combat the virus in Florida, and your state officials are amazing. They’ve been working so hard. The rate of positive cases in Florida has now declined. It’s declining. And hospitalizations are declining in most places and pretty steadily, and we think there’s going to be a big decline starting very soon.
President Donald Trump: (03:17)
There’s currently over 21% inpatient hospital bed capacity available, so there’s plenty of bed capacity. And over 16% ICU capacity available, and some of that’s going to be emptying out as people get better. They do get better, and they get better pretty fast.
President Donald Trump: (03:34)
Statewide, we’re providing additional resources and personnel to help save lives. We remain concerned about Florida, about Miami, and in a certain area of Miami in particular, but local officials are working very hard, and we think we have that one on the right step also. The test positivity rate has declined over the last week, and in some cases very substantially, as have hospitalization levels.
President Donald Trump: (03:59)
But we must further reduce the spread, and that’s what we’re doing. We’re working closely with health officials on the ground to support this effort. The single best way to defeat the disease is personal responsibility. You’ve heard me say it. You’ve heard a lot of people say it, actually. I urge all Americans to protect the elderly. The fact is you have to do the social distancing thing. It’s very important. Socially distance, wear a mask when you cannot avoid crowded places or socially distance, and wash your hands as often as possible.
President Donald Trump: (04:33)
Almost half of all deaths nationwide have been in nursing homes and assisted living centers. And I have to say the state of Florida, with regard to the nursing homes, has done an incredible job. Really an incredible job. They watched what was happening in some places, even beyond our own country, the other countries, they were seeing what was happening with the elderly and particularly in nursing homes. And Ron, you’ve done a great job on that. Appreciate it.
President Donald Trump: (04:59)
I have to say that there’s been a big surge of the China virus in other countries, very big countries that we thought they were doing a good job. And they were. They were doing a great job in some cases. But a big headline in the Wall Street Journal just yesterday and an editorial that all of a sudden they started to surge. So countries that we thought were doing great turned out to have big difficulty. I won’t name the countries, but you know them, there are a lot of them actually.
President Donald Trump: (05:26)
The average age of those who succumb to the virus is 78 years old. We’re also closely monitoring the situation in Latin America and its impact on the United States. Latin America has more confirmed cases than anywhere else in the world. Actually, substantially more. Having a hard time.
President Donald Trump: (05:45)
We’ve sent many ventilators to Latin America. We’ve sent many ventilators to different countries in Europe, Africa, and all over the world. We’re making thousands of ventilators now a month. We started off with essentially very little, and we become a ventilator manufacturer, so to speak, and we’re helping a lot of countries. We’ve sent them to France. We’ve sent them to Italy. A lot to Italy. We sent them to Mexico. We sent them to Russia. Moscow is having a tremendous problem. And we’ve sent him to a lot of different countries, many. And we have a full supply in our country. The amazing thing is we started with very few, and not one person that needed a ventilator did not get a ventilator, so that’s a pretty amazing statistic. We have nearly 1,400 federal personnel on the ground already in Florida, including personnel supporting nursing homes. We have doctors, military doctors. They’re incredible and very talented people. And frankly, they’re very brave people, but they’re all over the state, helping with your medical folks. And Ron asked if he could get some extra people here. We did it immediately.
President Donald Trump: (06:53)
In the last week, we’ve opened five new surge testing sites in Florida. In Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood Beach, Pompano Beach, and two in Miami. We’re sending rapid test kits to 701 Medicare and Medicaid certified nursing homes in the state. We’ve also sent multiple shipments of protective equipment to all of the nursing homes. And as I said on ventilators, I can also talk about in Florida, in Miami, they have everything they need. They don’t need any. We’ve sent a lot. They don’t need any.
President Donald Trump: (07:24)
Testing-wise, we’ve tested almost 60 million people throughout the country, which is about six times more than any other country, close to six times more than any other country. If you look at India, they’re at 11 million. We’re going to be at over 60 million, so they’ve done a tremendous job in testing considering we started off with very little. It was a unknown disease, and it was an unknown test.
President Donald Trump: (07:50)
FEMA, HHS, and the private sector have delivered more than 10,000,095 masks, 43 million surgical mask, 19.7 million gowns, and 1.3 billion medical gloves to Florida. 1.3 billion gloves, Ron.
President Donald Trump: (08:07)
We’ve secured 90% of the world’s supply of remdesivir, which has been very, very successful. And I’ve sent over 143 vials to Florida hospitals as a really something that’s very special and we’re working on very hard. Operation Warp Speed today, we reached a $2-billion agreement with Sanofi and GSX to conduct clinical trials and mass produce 100 million doses of vaccine.
President Donald Trump: (08:33)
What we’ve done is a rather incredible, I have to say. We have many companies, great companies, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, many companies are very close to getting the vaccine. We think it’s going to be in a very short time from now. And we’re set with our military to deliver the vaccine. We have a tremendous military delivery service, and that will be doing it. It’s called logistics, and they will be taking the vaccine and bringing it all over the country. And I’m sure that we’ll be supplying it beyond our country also, but we’re going to have it very soon.
President Donald Trump: (09:08)
We’re also having a tremendous work done on other treatments other than vaccines. So we have a lot of great things in the pipeline, I think things that are going to be really spectacular. I’m very excited about therapeutics because therapeutically, I think we have answers that are really looking good. In fact, if I had my choice, I’d probably initially maybe go with the therapeutics because you walk into the hospital, they get a shot or they do a transfusion depending on the company and what they’re doing. And a short time later, just people get better. So we’re looking at that very, very strongly.
President Donald Trump: (09:46)
I just want to thank Rick and Ron and everybody, done really a fantastic job. We’ve worked together so long and so hard, and this is something that came upon us. It should’ve never happened, but it came upon us, and there’s been great bravery from our doctors and our nurses, our frontline.
President Donald Trump: (10:03)
And there’s been great bravery from our doctors, and our nurses, our frontline people. And we’re very proud of what’s happening, and we’ll get rid of it. We’ll beat it. And it’ll be soon. We want to get our schools open. We want to get our businesses open. Much of the country is open. We’ve set records on number of employees, and hiring, and employment. Basically, if you look at the number, I think last month was the highest number ever hired in one month. And the month before that, we broke that record. So from that standpoint, we’ve done well. Retail sales set a record last month. So we’re doing really record increase. So we’re doing really well. And I think this will end hopefully very soon, but we’re fighting hard, and we’re fighting smart. And I’d like to ask your governor to say a few words. Please, Ron.
Ronald DeSantis: (10:47)
Thank you, Mr. President, welcome back to Florida. Thanks for all your support. We are monitoring very closely the track of Hurricane Isaias. Both the 11:00 AM and the 5:00 PM advisories from National Hurricane Center tacked it a little bit closer to the Florida coast. I think it’s pretty clear we will get, at a minimum, tropical storm force wind impacts, likely hurricane force wind impacts. We don’t know for sure whether the eye will actually interact with the coast of Florida. We’re looking actually, probably northern part of Palm Beach County. Maybe a little bit north of that is kind of where they’re going. Obviously we’ll know more. So I would just urge Floridians, just particularly if you’re from Deerfield Beach up until the Brevard-Volusia area, you are under a hurricane watch. Make sure you have your plan. Make sure you have seven days of food, and supplies, and medicine.
Ronald DeSantis: (11:39)
There could be some power outages. And it’s an ongoing, very fluid situation. As it does move west, it’s kind of weakening a tad. And if it strengthens, we think it may end up going further east. But just continue to listen to your local officials. We’ll be providing updates multiple times a day throughout the weekend. And obviously the federal government’s been great helping. We did submit for a landfall emergency declaration. So we look forward to that support. And we also want to thank the administration for supporting us with the fight against COVID-19. Anytime we needed anything, we would talk to the president, vice president, and we would get it.
Ronald DeSantis: (12:18)
So when we started to see the hospital admissions really pick up, the doctors were prescribing more Remdesivir. So we told them, “Hey, you guys have been sending us enough for when we had very low census. Now that the census is higher, can we get more? Can we move up these shipments?” And Alex was involved, the president, we got it up. And so we’ve accelerated a number of weeks of shipments. So they’ve been able to have the medications that they need. CDC put out, I think, important guidance last Friday that didn’t really get much attention, about people going back to work. A lot of employers in Florida had been demanding a negative PCR test in order to go back to work. CDC recommends against that now. And I think that is exactly the right thing compared to what we’ve seen. These PCR tests, you can test positive for 12 weeks. So we have people that are not infectious, have no live virus, and they’re getting a positive test 10 days, 20 days out.
Ronald DeSantis: (13:16)
And so CDC recommends going to a symptom-based approach. We’ve put that out, the state of Florida to all the employers, the symptom-based approach really is the more effective approach. And I think that that will just help people be able to go. If you’re symptomatic and you test positive, obviously we’re inferring live virus there. But the asymptomatic, 12 week window, and we really don’t know whether you’re infectious or not. So I think what we’re going to be doing because of what you guys have just sent us.
Ronald DeSantis: (13:45)
Additionally, the wait times on the labs, it’s just gotten backed up. We’re doing so many tests. Sometimes it takes seven to 10 days to get the results back. So what we’re going to do is we’ve already focused on our symptomatic test takers, which are a minority of the people testing. We have agreements with labs to get it turned around quicker. And then the federal government has sent us these point of care antigen tests. So we’re going to have 1,250 of those a day. So we’re going to convert some of our bigger test sites into point of care, antigen testing for symptomatic and elderly people, probably in Miami-Dade.
Ronald DeSantis: (14:19)
So this way they go, they get the result in 15 minutes, which is good for them. And then it gets reported to the state. So we have a real time understanding of the positivity and everything’s going on. When we get the test results reported, some of these tests are from two or three weeks ago. And these data dumps. So I think it’ll help us be able to understand the prevalence better. So that’s an important tool. So I just wanted to say thank you for sending those machines to us.
President Donald Trump: (14:43)
And you have the numbers in five minutes to 15 minutes or something, [inaudible 00:14:47].
Ronald DeSantis: (14:47)
That’s correct.
President Donald Trump: (14:48)
Especially for the elderly. Rick Scott, please.
Rick Scott: (14:52)
Sure. Well, first off, when I was governor, you were very helpful in the hurricanes we had. And I talked to the governor of Puerto Rico this morning, and she was very appreciative. FEMA’s there, FEMA’s being helpful. They’ve got some flooding. So she was traveling the island, but she said … I said, “Is there anything you need out of the federal government?” And they said, “You guys have done a great job.”
President Donald Trump: (15:17)
That’s great Rick, thank you very much.
Rick Scott: (15:18)
Thanks for doing that. And I just want to thank you for your commitment to the vaccine. I know that’ll be a game changer when that happens. And I know you and your administration have been very aggressive in making sure that happens in the testing. So I just want to tell you, I think you’ve done a great job trying to make sure everybody’s getting this done as quickly as possible. I think the governor is saying some of the issues that I’m sure a lot of states are having, but I know the Trump administration is working hard. I want to thank Secretary Azar. His team has done a great job. I’m going to tell you, Steve Hahn has done a great job. I mean, if you look at what the person talked about with regard to therapeutics, that would not happen, but for HHS and but for the FDA. And the authority you gave to doctors to be able to make decisions and be doctors. And I know you’re trying to get that information as quickly as possible so people make good decisions. So I want to thank everybody.
President Donald Trump: (16:07)
Thank you, Rick. And the speed of approval is just a tiny fraction of the time that it would have been in let’s say another administration. The FDA has been fantastic. They’re getting things through, Ron, at levels that nobody ever thought possible. We’re close to a vaccine. We think we’re close to a vaccine. And that’s been a matter of months, as opposed to many years. It could be take many years. And we think we’re going to have a great answer very, very soon. Alex, please.
Alex: (16:33)
Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. So we’re working very closely with FEMA as well as with the emergency authorities here in Florida on the hurricane situation. And of course, would advise all Floridians follow the advice of your state and local leaders as to what to do. But that advice may be a little bit different this time because of COVID. So normally you might evacuate. This time, more advice is going to focus on sheltering in place for Floridians who live at home, as well as for those in longterm care centers like nursing homes, or for people who are hospitalized. In addition, we’re recommending and working with the state to establish shelters that would be non congregate places for sheltering in place. If you do end up at a place that’s a congregate setting, it’s the same advice that we give in a non-emergency situation. Wear face coverings, practice good physical distance, good personal hygiene.
Alex: (17:28)
As the president said, we’ve had just a … I think it’s an historic 24 hours on the development of therapeutics and vaccines. Under the president’s Operation Warp Speed Initiative. Yesterday afternoon, the president made a historic national call to action for people to donate plasma. So I call on Floridians, please, if you have tested positive and recovered from COVID, go to coronavirus.gov and learn how you can donate your plasma and save lives through the American Red Cross, through America’s blood banks. You can make a real difference. And then as the president said, just this morning, we announced the sixth vaccine candidates from Sanofi GSK. A hundred million doses with an option for 500 million more.
Alex: (18:13)
So that’s now six major historic investments to bring us vaccines coming into the fall. And then also today, out of our National Institutes of Health, the RADx initiative led by Dr. Collins, which is next generation testing and diagnostics, announced a quarter of a billion dollars of funding on seven novel diagnostics that we’re investing in. That we believe could bring millions of additional diagnostics to the table as soon as September. Thanks to your leadership. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (18:44)
That’s right. Thank you very much, Alex, I appreciate it. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 2: (18:47)
Mr. President, thank you for being here in Florida today. We appreciate your foresight to organize our major corporations around this country to produce the type of equipment we need, the PPE we need here in the country. We’re looking forward to your leadership in the future to make sure we bring those manufacturing jobs back to the United States from all over the world, so that we’re better prepared in the future. You’ve worked very closely with our governor. The governor did a tremendous job making sure that we were protecting our most vulnerable. And so the state of Florida really shut down the longterm care facilities, and nursing homes, and other facilities. And it was the leadership from your administration, and the governor’s office, that allowed that to happen. And we’re very proud of the fact that we have the best pharmaceuticals anywhere around the world.
Speaker 2: (19:33)
And you know the half life [inaudible 00:19:35] are coming every day. Stage two and three trials for vaccines. We’re very excited that hopefully before the end of the year, we’re going to have a vaccine. But the therapeutic medicines are tremendous. And that is something for you to be very proud of. And your administration has done a tremendous job for the state of Florida and the country. So thank you.
President Donald Trump: (19:52)
And I just signed an executive order whereby the gentlemen on my right can go out and buy your prescription drugs at a number that you’d never thought possible. And I-
President Donald Trump: (20:03)
… Prescription drugs at a number that you’d never thought possible and I assume you’re going to be doing that pretty soon, Ron, right?
Ronald DeSantis: (20:06)
Yeah. No. Well, Wilton was involved in that legislation, in the legislature. So, we’re excited about it. I’ll also say, just with respect to the longterm care, your administration is sending, to a number of facilities throughout the country, nursing homes, point-of-care tests there as well. Now, we are testing all the staff every two weeks. We have over 200,000 staff, because we have over 4,000 facilities. And then if there’s an infection, then we would go and look to see if the residents need to be tested. And we’ve already tested all the residents throughout this pandemic. But the point-of-care, I think is going to be less, even for staff or residents, but for allowing visitors again. We’ve not had visitors in these places since mid March, because we feared having the introduction of the virus.
Ronald DeSantis: (20:46)
And I think that that’s the right decision to protect life, but that comes at an enormous emotional cost, because you have elderly folks who want to have that human connection. And so if you have a 15 minute test, you can have the family members go take the test, they can go in and see. That is important for health too, because mental wellbeing and everything is just really, really important. So I want to thank you for doing that. It’s really good. I think it’d be interesting, Justin really can give you a good synopsis about where the Florida trends are. I mean, if you kind of read what people will put out, versus the data we see, there’s obviously a discrepancy there and Justin’s been there. And so we talk with all his CEOs. We talk with him every day, about capacity, about the trends, about the discharges. And we’ve been able to handle this. We got some great people working very hard. But really, there was a lot of foresight into using the last few months to prepare for when we would have-
Justin: (21:44)
Yeah.
Ronald DeSantis: (21:44)
… an update.
President Donald Trump: (21:45)
Go ahead, Justin.
Justin: (21:45)
Yeah.
President Donald Trump: (21:45)
Thank you.
Justin: (21:46)
Our alliance has hospitals running from Pensacola all the way down to Miami. And we’ve seen probably between 40 and 50% of the COVID patients, positive patients, in the State of Florida. We are coming through a difficult month. But there are real reasons, and I think you touched on them in your opening remarks, for cautious optimism right now. Almost every one of our members has seen either their census leveling off, or actually starting to decline. And there’s real hope, I think, that August we’re going to see some acceleration there. The key is to keep working together. I think some of the difference makers, in terms of the outcomes in Florida and why Florida has fared relatively well, has to do with the decisions around longterm care facilities and requiring two positive tests before a patient is discharged from hospital to a longterm care facility.
Justin: (22:35)
I also think that the state has done an excellent job of relieving pressure on the hospitals. We have a lot of patients, elderly patients that are in the hospital, their COVID positive, but they’ve stabilized and they no longer need to be in the hospital. And you can’t discharge them to a longterm care facility, because they’re still COVID positive. That creates a lot of pressure on the hospital, to have that patient still in there, it takes up capacity. The state’s done a great job of setting up COVID only facilities, that have allowed us to get those patients out of the hospital, get them to a comfortable place where they get the treatment that they need. They get the services that they need, but the hospital has the capacity. Our hospitals are all participating in these clinical trials. Remdesivir was one that our hospital’s participated in. They’re participating in the antibody studies, and we have a lot of hope on those as well. And I think that the cooperation between the state, federal government is something that we’ve certainly seen firsthand. And we definitely appreciate all the work that’s gone in.
President Donald Trump: (23:34)
Well, you’ve really done a good job in the nursing homes. When I look at you compared to other places, frankly, you’ve really done a great job with nursing homes. I know you’re focused on it, but that’s been a very good situation compared to other places.
Ronald DeSantis: (23:46)
Yeah. I mean, so when we did these COVID only facilities, our thought is, one, we’re doing testing in the nursing homes. There’s a lot of nursing home residents who don’t develop really significant symptoms either. But if they can’t be isolated in the nursing home, where can you do it? You can send them to the hospital, but if they don’t need to be hospitalized… So we have these facilities that can accept the transfers, then when they clear the illness, then they go back. So it’s good for the resident, if they don’t have to be in the hospital, to not have to go. But then for the other residents, to not have somebody there spreading it. Because that, we obviously don’t want to see it spread anywhere, but if there’s one place we don’t want to see it spread, it’s in the longterm care facilities.
President Donald Trump: (24:24)
Well, that’s been really an amazing job. Kathleen, please.
Kathleen Peters: (24:28)
Thank you, Mr. President. It’s an honor to be here. I want to thank you and your administration, and the governor and his administration. I’ve had the wonderful privilege of serving as a mayor of a city, and then the House of Representatives and now as a county commissioner. And I’ve always held very tight to home rule. And I think that our success, particularly in Florida, is because you left it to the local communities to determine what was right for each individual community. And I think that way, we were able to just strategically come up with our approach that would really be comprehensive. And when we needed help, governor, your departments were there, they were right there to help us. And the CARES Act that we received $170 million, helped us not only prepare for PPE and do training and testing, but we’ve done a lot of training in every single nursing home.
Kathleen Peters: (25:20)
And that’s something where [inaudible 00:25:21] really stepped up and helped us with. And made sure that we had teeth that we could go in there and really ensure that they allowed us in, because at first they didn’t even allow us in. So providing the resources has been great, but allowing us the autonomy to come up with a plan that’s individualized for each individual county, I think has been the best way to attack this approach. So I really appreciate kind of taking the hands off approach, and just providing the resources and letting the local community do what they need to do. And it’s been very successful. Our positive rate now went down from a 14% to a six or 7%.
President Donald Trump: (25:54)
Wow, that’s great.
Kathleen Peters: (25:56)
So in Pinellas County, we’re doing really, really well. And our nursing homes are doing well, and our hospitals as well are having relief. And so-
President Donald Trump: (26:03)
That’s great.
Kathleen Peters: (26:04)
… we’re in really great shape. And so, thank you for all the resources.
President Donald Trump: (26:08)
Good job.
Kathleen Peters: (26:08)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (26:09)
Really good job. Thank you very much. Please.
Alex: (26:12)
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for having me. I’m the lone Miamian here at the table, but I wanted to say thank you for your leadership under this time. We have two great senators that have done a phenomenal job. And Senator Rubio, although he’s not here, has really been the flag bearer when it came to PPE. And in my district, which is in Miami, I’ve seen the small businesses survive, because of your assistance and leadership during this time. And at the same time, I think Senator Rick Scott has been very vocal, in making sure that taxpayer dollars don’t get used for some of the states that are trying to use them as a bailout.
President Donald Trump: (26:47)
Right.
Alex: (26:48)
And I think that’s very important. And it’s a point that you continue to hammer, along with the senator. And it’s one that we here in Florida have to continue to voice as well. But in Miami, the assistance has been so important, specifically when it comes to the elderly population. I think there’s a stat that I had seen a couple of days ago that stuck in my mind, which was roughly around $80 million has been used for meal assistance for the elderly. And I have a very elderly population in my district, and that comes out to about 9 million meals, for individuals that are not able to go out, for reasons that are private to their own. But nonetheless, it wouldn’t be possible without your leadership. So on behalf of Miami, we want to say thank you very much. And once again, welcome back home to Florida. That welcome on the way over here, I’ve never been a part of a motorcade, Mr. President, but I got chills. The love here for you is very real.
President Donald Trump: (27:39)
That was an amazing group of people, wasn’t it?
Alex: (27:41)
Yes, sir.
President Donald Trump: (27:41)
As long as we rode, and we rode a long time, we had tremendous crowds. And we appreciate it and we love Miami, we’ll take care of it. Okay?
Alex: (27:49)
Yes, sir.
President Donald Trump: (27:49)
Great job you’re doing.
Alex: (27:51)
Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (27:51)
Do you have any questions, please, for anybody?
Speaker 3: (27:56)
Mr. President, how concerned are you about your political standing in Florida, given the number of deaths we’ve been seeing in recent days?
President Donald Trump: (28:03)
Well based on the polls, I’m doing very well in Florida. And the local government is doing a fantastic job. I think we’re doing really a fantastic job and we’re getting everything that they need. They’ve, for the most part, had it anyway. We had it all stocked up and stacked up. And you remember, I used to say the cupboards were bare, federally. From the federal standpoint, we had very empty cupboards. Whether it was the military or the cupboards for medical, they were bare. And Ron, I think Ron and Rick would both say, we’ve really supplied you with a lot, not only having to do with the medical and the COVID, but having to do with a lot more, in particular, some of the hurricanes. In your time and your time, we had some really bad ones and we came through. So, the polls are looking very good. And I think when you see those crowds people along the roads, there’s a very good feeling.
Speaker 3: (28:49)
But what about the number of deaths we’ve seen in recent days here?
President Donald Trump: (28:51)
Well, I hate it anywhere. But if you look at other countries, other countries are doing terribly. This is a horrible disease. This is a disease that should have never happened. It’s something never should have been allowed to get out of China, but it did. It came here. It went to Europe. It went all over the world. It’s in 188 countries. And I will say this, proportionately, relatively, when you look at your nursing home situation, it’s a tribute to your governor and government, the job they’ve done. You’ve done a really great job. And you have a very big nursing home population. You’ve done a fantastic job. So, I think we’re doing really well in Florida. Yeah?
Speaker 4: (29:26)
Mr. President, you told Axios in an interview earlier this week that you did not bring up the intelligence assessment with Vladimir Putin, that they have been placing bounties on our soldiers heads. You said it was because no one had brought it to your attention, but it was in your Presidential Daily Briefing. Have you been reading that briefing every day?
President Donald Trump: (29:45)
I read it all the time. I see it all the time. It was never brought to my attention. I think it’s another Russia hoax. They’ve been giving me the Russia hoax, shifty Schiff and all these characters, from the day I got here. And we’re working with Russia right now on a non-proliferation agreement, nuclear, non-proliferation. And..
President Donald Trump: (30:03)
Proliferation Agreement, nuclear non-proliferation, and if we can get something like that it’d be great, but it was never brought to my attention. And because it didn’t reach the level, there were a lot of people, including Democrats, that said it never took place. If it did take place, it would have been brought to my attention. And I would take very strong action. There’s been nobody tougher with Russia or China than I have, not even by a long shot. When you look at what we’ve done compared to the past administrations, it’s not even a contest. We’ve been very tough on Russia with the sanctions and so many other things, including letting people know that we’re not so happy about what’s going on with NATO and the oil.
President Donald Trump: (30:41)
But speaking of NATO, we’ve raised $130 billion a year from countries from as you know, from our partners with NATO, 28 countries. We had seven that were paid up. Now we have a very much bigger number. We’re getting $130 billion more. That’s going to $400 billion, and that’s money to really protect themselves for the most part against Russia. So nobody’s done more against Russia, but it was never brought to my attention. And it perhaps wasn’t brought because they didn’t consider it to be real. And if it is brought to my attention, I’ll do something about it.
Press Speaker 1: (31:16)
Mr. President, what’s in your healthcare plan that’s coming on Sunday?
President Donald Trump: (31:20)
Well, we’re going to be doing a healthcare plan. We’re going to be doing a very inclusive healthcare plan. I’ll be signing it some time very soon.
Press Speaker 1: (31:27)
You said two weeks [crosstalk 00:31:28]-
President Donald Trump: (31:29)
It might be Sunday, but it’s going to be very soon. We’re also doing a full immigration plan. We’re going to take care of a lot of things that for 25 years, they’ve been trying to get an immigration plan. We’re going to be doing merit based immigration. I’m sure you’ll be happy to hear that, but it’s merit based, very powerfully merit based. It’s going to be very inclusive. It’s going to cover just about everything that most people would have said couldn’t happen. And we’ll be releasing that over the next couple of weeks.
President Donald Trump: (31:57)
We’re doing a healthcare plan. We’re doing a immigration plan and we’re doing another one that’s very important are the drugs, prescription drug prices. We pay the highest of any country in the world by far. You look at Germany and you look at UK and Canada and other countries, and they pay a fraction of what we pay. And we’re doing a series of signatures, which I’ve done. And one goes into effect very soon, but we’re doing matching grants and all sorts of things that are got to bring our drug prices down at levels that nobody ever thought possible. We’re doing things that nobody ever thought possible.
President Donald Trump: (32:34)
The bad news is the pharmaceutical companies aren’t exactly in love with Donald Trump and they’ll advertise. They’ve already started it. I see they’ve already started. Have you seen the ads? And anytime you see an ad from a pharmaceutical company against me, you know that means the drug prices are coming down. But they’re going to be coming down to a level that nobody ever thought possible. As an example, Germany has very low prices and we have very high prices, many times the amount, and we have to get, no matter what the price, lowest price in the world, that’s what they have to give us. And right now we have, by far, the highest price in the world. We’re going to allow states like Florida go to Canada and to buy their prices are much lower than ours. So they’re going to be able to buy directly from Canada rather than going through their traditional sources. And I think in the state of Florida, what will that cut the prescription drug prices?
Ronald DeSantis: (33:25)
Well, I mean, it depends on the drug, but there were some when we were doing the bill that you could get for 75% less in terms of what would Canada would charge.
President Donald Trump: (33:32)
How about that? 75% less. So they’re going to be buying it approximately 75% less. What we’re doing really, which is the most, we’re doing rebates. And the rebates are going to go to the people and they’re going to go in the form of drug reduction, drug price reduction. But we’re doing something called favored nations. And nobody thought anybody would ever do that. But look, I want what’s right for the people. And it’s been very unfair. So favored nations, meaning if another nation is paying lower and another nation is paying even lower than that, we take the lowest nation in the world and that’s what we have to pay.
President Donald Trump: (34:05)
Right now we’re paying many times the lowest nation in the world. You have some of these socialistic or social, well, I guess you could say socialistic nations, they have drugs at a low price. Well, we’ll use that to our advantage because we’re going to be getting the price that they have. Now, what’s going to happen is that price will probably have to go up and our price will go way down. And I could see 50, 60, 70%, maybe more than that reduction in prices that no other president will ever do that. And the heat I’ve taken in the last couple of weeks because of that is unbelievable. And frankly, the ads I’ve taken are unbelievable. It’s sort of incredible. You see drug companies taking these massive ads.
Ronald DeSantis: (34:42)
When we did our bill, I’ve never seen more ads in Florida that pharmaceutical was doing. I mean, I have young kids, I’m watching like Paw Patrol with them and it goes to commercial and it’s saying that Florida, they’re going to bring in all these drugs from Djibouti, it’s going to kill everybody. So, I mean, it was unbelievable how they papered the airwaves a lot of money.
President Donald Trump: (35:02)
Keep in mind, the same drug that you paid a fortune for, for half the price maybe better than that even, the exact same drug made maybe in the same factory, the same company. And you’re going to be paying a fraction of the price. But the drug companies are not happy. And look, we want them to be happy. We want them to do well with the vaccines and we want them to do well with everything, but they’ve made a fortune and that’s why they could afford the ads. That’s for sure.
President Donald Trump: (35:26)
So when you see ads against us, and me in particular because I’m the one that, I’ve signed four acts, we’ll call it executive orders. And they’re the most powerful ever signed in this industry by a factor of about 20. And it’s going to bring your drug prices down to a level that you’ve never seen before. I’m very happy about that. The drug companies don’t contribute to my campaign. I don’t need their money. I haven’t asked for their money. And if they did, it wouldn’t matter to me anyway, but I am not somebody that’s reliant on the drug companies, and we call it big pharma. Big pharma is probably the most powerful lobbyist of any lobbyist there is probably. I don’t know. Maybe the lawyer’s lobby is pretty powerful, too. But big pharma would be just about up there.
President Donald Trump: (36:12)
And we have to do what’s right. They’ve been talking about reducing drug prices ever since I can remember, ever since I’ve been starting to really watch politics with interest, which was actually at a very young age, but we’ve been talking about drug price reductions and prescription drug reductions. And I will tell you, you’re going to see the biggest reductions in the history of our country by many times. We’re not talking about a 1%. And as you know, last year for the first time in 51 years, drug prices went down marginally, but they went down. First time in 51 years. So I was president then drug prices went down first time at 51 years. Now you’re going to see numbers that you wouldn’t even believe. And it’s going to be fair.
President Donald Trump: (36:53)
It’s not fair that other countries pay a fraction of, I mean a fraction of what we do. We pay all research and development and promotional costs and everything, it’s put onto the United States. They pay nothing. Nothing. And then on top of it, they say, “This is what we’ll pay and this is what it is.” And the United States will pay the remainder of the difference. I mean, this is the way they buy. They go, and I won’t mention names of countries, but they say, “This is what we’re going to pay. The United States will make up the difference.” And that’s not going to happen anymore. Okay. Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you.
Speaker 5: (37:29)
Press, thank you.
President Donald Trump: (37:32)
Thank you very much.
Speaker 5: (37:32)
Press, thank you. Press, thank you. We’re done for today.

Are you up for election this year?

Press, thank you."
"Jul 30, 2020",Uknown,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
… is to help treat those battling the current infection that we all know so well. Plasma is one of the more delicate ways of doing things. It’s had tremendous response so far we’ve had, and it’s an effort to really accelerate new therapies and further reduce mortality. We’ve been able to show some tremendous things. If you notice today, it was covered very well. A lot of countries where they thought they were doing well, they’re not doing well at all. They’ve had explosions. Explosions, unfortunately. We’re joined by secretary of health and human services who’s doing a terrific job, Alex Azar, Alex, hi Alex. FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn. Hi, Steve. Surgeon General, Jerome Adams. And I hope your wife is okay, Jerome. I know she had a little difficulty, but I’m sure she’s going to be fine. Right? Please give her my regards. Thank you, Jerome.
Donald Trump: (01:11)
Dr. Francis Collins, who everyone knows. Francis, thank you very much. NIH. And Dr. Anthony Fauci. Anthony, hi. And Deborah. Where’s Deborah? Deborah. Hi, Deborah. Good job. Everybody’s doing a good job. Everybody’s working very hard. I want to also thank to the CEO of American Red Cross. Somebody who’s done outstanding work. I’ve known about it for a long time, Gail McGovern. Thank you, Gail. She’s done really an outstanding job too. CEO of America’s Blood Centers, Kate Fry. Hi, Kate. Thank you very much. CEO of CSL Limited, Paul Perreault. Paul, thank you very much. Great job. And CEO of LabCorp, Adam Schechter. Thank you, Adam, very much.
Donald Trump: (02:07)
We’ve taken bold actions to give Americans access to plasma therapies. The FDA made the treatment available to patients with life-threatening infections beginning in March. We provided 48 million dollars to the Mayo Clinic to support their expanded access program for plasma. We’re providing up to 270 million dollars to the Red Cross and America’s Blood Centers for the collection of up to 360,000 units of plasma.
Donald Trump: (02:37)
My administration is partnering with commercial labs, insurers and healthcare providers to encourage those who have had the virus who donate plasma. So if you’ve had the virus, if you donate, it would be a terrific thing. We really need donations of the plasma. To those that have had the virus, you’ve gotten through it, and I guess that means you have something very special there, right? Yeah. So we would appreciate that. It would help a lot of people. We’re grateful to LabCorp for offering free antibody testing to identify people who can donate. And LabCorp has really been fantastic in a lot of ways, and other ways also.
Donald Trump: (03:20)
As a result of these initiatives, we’ve already treated nearly 50,000 patients with plasma. Roughly two million Americans have fully recovered from the virus. This afternoon, I’m asking you the citizens to go to the coronavirus.gov. It’s coronavirus.gov, and volunteered to donate plasma as soon as she can. We have a lot of people that would heal, would get better. Soon as you can, please.
Donald Trump: (03:47)
In addition, I’m once again urging to all Americans to protect the elderly, socially distance, wear a mask when you cannot avoid the crowded places. And if you can, you have to avoid crowded places. It just seems like so many things are taking place in crowded places. We don’t want that. And always wash your hands. Wash your hands as often as you can. Together we’ll defeat the virus, we’ll defeat the invisible enemy. I want to thank the American Red Cross. I’ve been a fan of the Red Cross for a long time, as you know, and we appreciate the great work that you do. Thank you very much, Gail. And now I’d like to ask Gail to say a few words, please. Thank you.
Gail McGovern: (04:29)
Mr. President, thank you so much for joining us today and for shining the light on the critical need for convalescent plasma. I’m honored to be seated here with these distinguished top medical experts who are striving to help us deal with this terrible pandemic. And I am so grateful that the American Red Cross can actually play a role in the treatment of COVID-19. We’re helping to collect units of convalescent plasma, which I’ve been told is showing promising results and it’s treating COVID patients. We’ve shipped over 24,000 units so far. And I am in awe of our donors who are donating convalescent plasma. They struggled through this disease, they came through the backend, they have precious antibodies, and hospitals are transfusing their plasma into patients that are struggling mightily with the disease themselves. And it’s a testament to the generosity of the American public.
Gail McGovern: (05:36)
These donors have recovered from a debilitating disease and they’re willing to lend an arm to help somebody they probably will never even have the opportunity to meet. And in fact, blood donors in general are just so generous. They are helping save someone’s life and they do it without question. And it’s just an amazing, amazing thing. Americans always step up whether it’s a pandemic or a hurricane, and it’s a privilege to be able to see the generosity of the American public over and over again, whether they’re volunteering, donating blood, or even providing us with financial donations. So on behalf of the entire American Red Cross, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to the people that actually recovered from COVID-19 and are giving this remarkable gift of life to help them recover as well.
Gail McGovern: (06:36)
And right now the demand for convalescent plasma is exceeding our collections. So we really do need people to come out and donate. In fact, over the past month, the number of orders doubled from our hospitals. So, please, please, please, I know I speak on behalf of Kate as well, consider donating plasma if you had COVID because you are going to do a wonderful thing. It’s easy, it doesn’t take a lot of time, and I can tell you that when you donate blood, you leave our blood center, you feel so great. You just feel so great about yourself because you just saved someone’s life, and not a lot of people can make that claim. So thank you again, Mr. President, and really appreciate the shout-out for convalescence plasma.
Donald Trump: (07:23)
Thank you, Gail. Great job.
Gail McGovern: (07:24)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (07:24)
You’re doing something very special. Thank you.
Gail McGovern: (07:28)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (07:28)
Alex, please.
Alex Azar: (07:32)
Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for leading the effort now to get people to donate convalescent plasma. This is going to be a major national initiative in the months ahead. And I want to thank the Red Cross and I want to thank America’s blood banks for work that they’re doing to bring our donors in and to get this plasma. For the tens of thousands of people that have already donated plasma, thank you for what you’ve done. You are literally saving lives. And we need hundreds of thousands more to please come forward. If you’ve been infected and recovered, please go to coronavirus.gov or reach out to your American Red Cross outlet or your local blood bank. And please be a donor. We now have more than 48,000 patients that have received convalescent plasma, thanks to the work of American researchers and physicians, the FDA, HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and groups like the Red Cross and our blood banks.
Alex Azar: (08:36)
This effort is just one piece of what the president’s leading towards bringing therapeutics to the market. So we have remdesivir, we have steroids for lung injury, and now we bring convalescent plasma to people. We’ve invested more than 1.7 billion dollars through our Operation Warp Speed, which is the president’s initiative to get vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics to the American people in record time. And when it comes to therapeutics, warp speed means weeks, not months. Earlier this month through Operation Warp Speed, we announced a 450 million dollar agreement with Regeneron to support their promising monoclonal antibody cocktail.
Alex Azar: (09:16)
What makes OWS so bold is that we’ve now paid to begin making doses of this is of this Regeneron product before it receives FDA authorization or approval. And that means that if, and only if, this drug meets FDA’s gold standard for safety and effectiveness, we’ll have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of doses to distribute to American patients right away, as soon as this fall. And that’s what today is about also, ensuring that even as the FDA reviews the data on convalescent plasma, we have plenty of supply, we have access for people. It also enables us to develop new therapies such as hyperimmune globulin, which is the distilled purified version of our convalescent plasma. So, thanks to everyone who’s donated. And thank you, Mr. President, for this national call to action to donate.
Alex: (10:03)
Mr. President for this national call to action to donate and thanks to all of our future donors. Thank you Mr. President.
Speaker 1: (10:07)
Thank you very much Alex. Appreciate it. Dr. Collins, please.
Francis Collins: (10:13)
Thank you Mr. President and good afternoon everyone. It’s wonderful to be in this beautiful space and thanks very much Gail and everybody at Red Cross for hosting us here while we try to make it clear what a remarkable gift Americans have been giving by donating plasma if they’ve recovered from COVID-19 because that has the potential to help lots of people. Your own human body is a wonderful little biotechnology factory, even if you might not think about it that way. Your immune system is ready to take on whatever kind of pathogen happens to wander into your environment and potentially threaten you and we know this is a particularly impressive virus for what it can do, and yet most of us, thank God, once exposed to this, do figure out how to recover from it because that immune system kicks into gear and makes those antibodies that then allow the virus to lose the battle and you to win and now having done so, you’re in a position to be able to donate your biotechnology product which is your plasma to somebody else who’s just now getting sick with this disease and you have a chance to help them if their own factory hasn’t quite kicked in.
Francis Collins: (11:25)
Americans are amazing and the way in which people have been doing this is truly inspiring. Americans seem to believe that biblical verse, “Onto whom much has been given much will be required.” To whom coronavirus has been given and they’ve recovered apparently, they have recognized that they have something else that they can do to help the next person, and that is inspiring, and we’re here to encourage more and more people to see that as something practical and important they can do at the time of this global pandemic. You already heard though from the comments made by the secretary that this is part of a remarkable menu of therapeutics, treatments that are being developed against coronavirus and this particular one also opens the door to other kinds of immune therapy, the monoclonal antibodies that were mentioned where money has now been devoted to scaling that up with a company called Regeneron is basically to take the part of a convalescent plasma that we think is the most potent and figure out how to turn that into a purified product. Not quite there to show yet whether that works but that is also a very promising approach, and there are a couple of trials of monoclonal antibodies from other companies that are on the launching pad starting as soon as tomorrow.
Francis Collins: (12:43)
So all of this fits together with what the Trump administration has been doing through Operation Warp Speed to literally bring all hands on deck from the public sector, from the private sector, nobody worrying too much about who’s going to get the credit, let’s just move this forward and save lives and all of the Americans who have been donating their plasma are a big part of that team. So thanks, it’s wonderful to be part of this event this afternoon.
Speaker 1: (13:03)
Thank you Francis. Appreciate it very much. Kate, please.
Kate: (13:12)
Thank you Mr. President for having this important event today. America’s Blood Centers is the national trade association for independent community blood centers. Our members are responsible for over 60% of the nation’s blood supply and have been at the forefront of convalescent plasma collections in the U.S. over the past four months. There are more than 60 independent community blood centers as well as hospital blood banks operating hundreds of donation facilities, taking part in the effort to collect convalescent plasma, to ensure this product gets to every patient in every hospital across the country. We’re excited to announce today that as of this week, independent community blood centers have distributed more than 100,000 doses of COVID-19 convalescent plasma to patients in need. Every blood center, small, medium and large, across the country has mobilized to do their part in this effort. Of course we are not slowing or stopping down in any kind of way. We are mobilizing to do even more and we are projecting that we will double our current number of doses by the end of August.
Kate: (14:18)
This unprecedented response by community blood centers demonstrates their commitment to meeting patient need wherever it is. America’s Blood Centers and its members will continue to collaborate with the administration, federal agencies and all stakeholder partners to ensure in advance the safe collection and distribution of convalescent plasma. Now the single most important thing of our ability to do more in distributing convalescent plasma is having donors and so this event is so important in terms of our ability to educate the American public and encourage them to donate. I would say that when you make a donation appointment and appointments are critical here at your local blood center, you’ll go through a process, the whole appointment takes about 90 minutes, and it’s a safe and easy way to help your fellow Americans. So we are following, all blood centers are following social distancing protocols. They’ve implemented infection disease protocols as well so this is a very safe and easy way to help others. So thank you again for having this event and we look forward to being part of this effort.
Speaker 1: (15:22)
Thank you very much Kate. Appreciate it. Tony and Deborah, please.
Dr. Anthony Fauci: (15:29)
Thank you very much Mr. President for support of this very important program. When we talk about what is going on in this country and the challenge we’re facing, we often say that it’s something where we are all in it together and we all have to pull together. An important part of the process of being in it together and pulling together is helping each other, and I can think of nothing more manifesting to helping of each other than someone donating from their experience of being ill and this is something that I think is part of the American spirit and we should be proud of it and we should show it, so it’s a very important thing. It’s an important part of the entire response to this outbreak.
Dr. Anthony Fauci: (16:15)
I want to mention that when we do something like give convalescent plasma, it’s important to understand as several of us have mentioned that it is an important part of the spectrum of interventions and response. We have good therapies and we’ll get better therapies for people with advanced disease. We have the dexamethasone for the people on ventilators, the Remdesivir with people who have been hospitalized, who have lung involvement, and now we’re talking about another important part of intervention. It’s the intervention early in infection to prevent people from needing to go to the hospital, and that’s really what convalescent plasma is because the mechanism of it is directed against the virus. It’s taking the machinery that Francis had spoken about that the body makes to get a protein to block the virus and that’s exactly what this is all about.
Dr. Anthony Fauci: (17:13)
Now it’s also important to point out that this could be a proof of concept because when antibodies work, it tells you a few things. It will tell you that when you have a vaccine and you induce antibodies, it could work and this is the good news that’s juxtaposed to what happened a couple of days ago when we went into the Phase III trial for a vaccine. Some of you may have heard me say that I was cautiously optimistic, a word that I use often, that we will be successful with a vaccine. One of the reasons is that in the Phase I study, the vaccine-induced response that was comparable if not better than what we see in convalescent plasma. So here’s [inaudible 00:17:59] a vaccine essentially merges with the work we’re doing now with convalescent plasma. That’s the reason why we think it’s so important and why it’s so important for people to donate. Thank you Mr. President.
Speaker 1: (18:11)
Thank you very much Tony. Thanks.
Gail McGovern: (18:15)
Thank you Mr. President and thank you for lending your voice to the day’s important to call of action. I’m really making the two critical points of what we’re calling every American to do. Thank you for noting how important it is for every American to give back by wearing a mask, by socially distancing, and from avoiding crowded places where they may not be able to social distance or wear a mask and we know what we’re talking about, parties and bars. Thank you for also really calling to action for those who have recovered to donate life-saving plasma to others and I think these two pieces together, knitted together to stop the spread of the virus through masks, social distancing and avoiding crowded spaces either indoors or outdoors and protecting the vulnerable and at the same time calling for action to increase our therapeutic abilities to treat more patients. Thank you.
Speaker 1: (19:05)
Thank you very much. Please. Thank you.
Adam: (19:13)
Mr. President, thank you for having us today and thank you for this national call to action. We think it’s very important. At LabCorp our employees have been working seven days a week three shifts a day to try to perform as many tests as fast as we possibly can to see who has the virus. I’m proud to say that today, we can do 180,000 tests per day and we can turn those tests around in one day for priority patients and two to three days for all other patients and I want to thank Dr. Hahn, Admiral Giroir, Secretary Azar for all of their help to ensure that we have what we need to get these tests turned around even faster and we’re going to continue to build capacity. At the same time we realize that there’s more that LabCorp can do and since the beginning we are a part of a coalition called The Fight Is In Us and it’s a group of companies that came together to try to encourage people that have had the disease in the
Adam: (20:03)
Companies that came together to try to encourage people that have had the disease in the past to give plasma. To accelerate that we’re going to announce in the next several days that we will have free high affinity antibody tests available for anybody through their physician, where if they’re going for routine blood work the physicians could just add on an antibody test we will run it. And the only thing that we ask is if the patient has antibodies that they please consider to donate plasma.
Donald Trump: (20:30)
It’s a great idea thank you very much, appreciated. Dr. Haln, please.
Francis Collins: (20:37)
Thank you Mr. President. Based upon your call to action FDA has responded to remove any unnecessary barriers to the speeding of medical products during this pandemic. I want to thank American Red Cross and American blood centers for the collaboration that we’ve had and the development of the [inaudible 00:20:56] and plasma program. Mr. President and secretaries I mentioned in March FDA began working with our colleagues to develop this program. The Mayo clinic has initiated what’s called an expanded access program which has really allowed physicians around the country to order convalescent plasma as an early treatment for patients. A number of clinical trials beyond the expanded access program are taking place. We’re encouraged by the data, we’ve seen that this is a safe treatment and we’re encouraged by the early promising data that we’ve seen and as the president mentioned, we’re studying these data to determine ultimately the safety and efficacy of this product.
Francis Collins: (21:35)
In the meantime, we know that doctors are writing these orders to patients who were hospitalized need this so the call to action to donate is so important. And even if at the end of the day, convalescent plasma doesn’t turn out to be the treatment we think it might be, remember that your donations still count with the American blood centers and American Red Cross.
Francis Collins: (21:56)
They can truly save lives. And just to put another point on the therapeutics development FDA’s now overseeing over 200 clinical trials of therapies that the great American biomedical research enterprises put forward. And more than 400 are in the planning stages. So we have a tremendous pipeline of therapies for COVID-19. It’s been an unbelievable private and public partnership and Mr. President thank you for your leadership.
Donald Trump: (22:22)
Stephen could you give a few words on the speed with which we’re getting the vaccines out and hopefully approved and finalized and where we are with phase one two and three et cetera?
Francis Collins: (22:34)
Yes sir. We have a number of companies that have come forward with vaccine candidates. Some of those are in Operation Warp Speed, and I want to emphasize the fact that FDA has a very bright line drawn between its actions and Operation Warp Speed. We are the independent regulator and as the president said, we’ll ultimately calling the balls and strikes with respect to the safety and efficacy of a vaccine.
Francis Collins: (22:58)
We have six vaccine candidates that have come to FDA and we given them the safe to proceed into clinical trials. Two are currently in the latest phase of trials called phase three, and they started this week. Another one is planning to go into phase three in August and then an additional three are in other phases of the clinical development. Four additional vaccines have come to us and we expect to allow them to go forward fairly soon. And then there are a number of 50 plus vaccines that have come in house for the pre-application process. I think we can all agree that this has been sort of a remarkable effort from when the virus was first identified at the NIH and sequences made to the initiation of the first clinical trial. NID spending a lot of time getting that to that point. It really is record speed but also at your direction Mr. President we aren’t cutting corners with respect to the development. And we will not be cutting corners with respect to the assessment and the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.
Donald Trump: (23:57)
And you’re literally many, many months and even years ahead of schedule in terms of the problem. So we really appreciate the FDA. Please let everyone know how we feel all of us, thank you. Great job. Jerome please.
Jerome: (24:14)
Thank you Mr. President. I really appreciate you being here today. The theme of this national call to action is we’re in this together. And when I think about all of us being in this together, I think about an iconic American image. Rosie, the Riveter. Rosie, the Riveter became a part of our history because we were at war. People were scared, people felt helpless, but the American spirit is all about people coming together, coming together to defeat a common enemy. And we have a common enemy now it’s COVID-19, but we also have tools that everyone can bring to bear to really help us overcome this enemy. One of those is convalescent plasma. One thing I want to add to the discussion that hasn’t been brought up yet is that the average age of donation of blood and plasma is over the age of 60.
Jerome: (25:15)
So to the young people out there, we’ve got some work to do, the seniors are showing us up. We need everyone to do their part because we’re all in this together. I also want to foot stamp something that Dr. Birx mentioned and that Dr. Fauci mentioned. There’s a spectrum that we have here of treatments that are way downstream, treatments that are midstream and then preventative measures that we can all take because we’re all in this together. And Mr. President, I want to thank you for emphasizing the three W’s. Number one, wash your hands. Number two, watch your distance. Number three, wear a mask. I was in Miami just a few weeks ago and I promised them I would tell you this. I was in Trump country and they told me to deliver you a message Mr. President. They told me to tell you you look bad ass in a face mask. I promised them I would tell you that, Miami I told the president he looks bad ass in a face mask. We are all in this together. Give blood, give plasma, save a life. We’ll get through this America.
Donald Trump: (26:27)
Thank you Jerome.
Jerome: (26:27)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (26:27)
Please.
Paul Perreault: (26:32)
Thank you Mr. President for having me here today. And really to join with the partners that are here together to join our mission of combating this disease with our particular expertise and technologies. I also want to thank you for your leadership. I think that no one has seen this in the world, it takes resolve and it takes effort. And you’ve shown that both with your leadership but also with the founding of Operation Warp Speed. So thank you for that. I also want to thank you for your outstanding team that we’re working with. Great people, really have done a fantastic job and for proactively engaging the private sector to combat COVID-19. I am Paul Perreault, I’m the CEO of CSL limited. Our legacy in fighting infectious disease goes back to 1901 with Emil von Behring, who was the first Nobel prize winner in medicine. Who actually utilized plasma as a means to fighting off diptheria.
Paul Perreault: (27:38)
So our history is long in this space. Since then CSL’s been committed to innovating and developing therapies for rare and serious diseases. That’s our business. We currently have several RND programs that are fighting for COVID-19. Including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and plasma therapies. We are one of the world’s largest collectors of plasma. I’m here today representing all of the manufacturers of hyperimmune. Including the COVID-19 Plasma Alliance, which is really an unprecedented partnership with world leading plasma companies who have joined together to help develop a plasma therapy to treat COVID-19. And I have to say that the help from the FTC was important as well because we’re typically competitors and this is really a combination of all of these companies working together.
Paul Perreault: (28:39)
The plasma donated by people who have fought off COVID-19 as you’ve already heard, has precious antibodies. Really important antibodies to fight off this disease. These antibodies can be isolated and then they can be converted into what we term a hyperimmune plasma therapy that in theory could be used to treat active COVID-19 infections. It builds on the concept of plasma transfusion, but the product is more like a standard medicine. This is an important approach and it’s well established in treating other infectious diseases like rabies or tetanus. Working jointly with the NIH, the major plasma manufacturers have designed a clinical trial that will be enrolling individuals in the month of August.
Paul Perreault: (29:29)
And if the data from this supports our hypothesis, we could be in a position to submit the hyperimmune therapy to Dr. Haln for immune therapy against COVID-19 by the end of this year. But we need plasma and we need plasma donors. So we need them wherever they are, we need them to donate blood. We need them to donate plasma. And we also need plasma in general because plasma is used to treat other rare diseases. So this-
Paul Perreault: (30:03)
Because plasma is used to treat other rare diseases. So this call to action that we’re in this together, the fight is in us, we have to work together, and this call to action to donate plasma and help us fight against COVID-19 is really an important step in making this happen. So we thank you for bringing us together. And thank you, Gail, for hosting us.
Donald Trump: (30:22)
And I hope you’ll be able to do it even before the end of the year, and maybe substantially before that from what I’m hearing. Okay? Thank you very much.
Paul Perreault: (30:29)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (30:30)
Would anybody have any questions of these very brilliant people having to do with plasma, antibodies? Any questions? Steve, go ahead.
Steve: (30:40)
I was going to ask, the death toll is now 150,000. What is the current projection going forward? What should we expect in the next couple of months?
Donald Trump: (30:48)
Well, I’d like to perhaps, Tony, do you want to discuss that, please?
Dr. Anthony Fauci: (30:54)
You know, as many as we possibly can. I mean, really. Because if you look at it, we almost will not have enough that would be utilizable, particularly not only for the administration, but also what was just mentioned about the supply of the hyperimmune globulin. So really an unlimited amount. There really is as many as we possibly can get, in the hundreds of thousands.
Speaker 2: (31:17)
Are you going to recommend that Americans wear goggles as well as face masks to defend against the virus? Is that going to become a new CDC recommendation?
Donald Trump: (31:28)
I can tell you, I only heard of goggles for the first time about one hour ago. Now I’m hearing about goggles. So I don’t know. Deborah, do you want to discuss that?
Gail McGovern: (31:39)
So I believe Dr. Fauci talked about this yesterday, but we have in the hospital systems and have for exposure have had people using face shields. And I think you’ve seen that through my tour through the United States and 14 states across the country where the president sent me to make sure that we were combating the virus well on the ground. Tennessee has created teachers, special teacher packs, to ensure that every teacher has a face mask, a face shield, gloves, and hand sanitizers. And I think we’re trying to bring these best practices back to ensure that teachers feel safe in the classroom in the same way that doctors and nurses feel safe in the hospitals to decrease their exposure.
Donald Trump: (32:21)
I think when you look at Miami, by the way, or Florida in particular, it looks like things are getting much better. Arizona getting much better, heading down, heading in the right direction. Some other areas getting much better. It could be catching on, unfortunately, in a couple of areas. We don’t know quite yet, but we’ll be able to report that soon. But some very big progress being made in some of the states that two weeks ago looked like they were going to be quite bad. Had some great progress made. All right. Any other questions please?
Tom Howell: (32:51)
Mr. President. Tom Howell, Washington Times. Are you concerned at all about the lag time it takes to get a test back? We’ve heard reports a week or more, generally from LabCorp talking about that a little bit. What’s going on there? Has there been improvement?
Donald Trump: (33:07)
So we’re getting mostly now we’re ordering as many of the immediate tests, which is five minutes to 15 minutes, even a little bit less than, in some cases, than five minutes. But we’re trying to get those tests. We have pretty close to 50% I call them short term tests. But we’re up to about a 50%, which is amazing. The other tests, while good, you have to send them, then they have to do the work, and they have to send them back. So the process takes long just in terms of delivery. We really are liking the short term tests where you find out immediately whether or not you have a problem. And that’s what we’re striving for, but we’re already up to approximately 50%. Is that correct, Deborah?
Gail McGovern: (33:51)
I think with the new antigen tests that are available now to nursing homes, that will really help our turnaround times to get them out more specifically. But you haven’t charged us to get that turnaround time down across the board. And we’re working with FDA to make pooling available. The reason LabCorp has been able to decrease their turnaround time so remarkably is they moved to pooling several weeks ago. That’s dramatically increasing our throughput throughout the country. And so we really need to call on all the laboratories to learn from LabCorp and others that are doing pooling like [inaudible 00:34:23] and LabCorp to really increase our turnaround times, to decrease our turnaround times. We know that it’s possible that we can decrease it by at least 50% if all of our laboratories moved to pooling. So sir, we’re doing as you said and we’re going to decrease those turnaround times.
Donald Trump: (34:36)
Good, thank you. And how is LabCorp doing about turnaround?
Adam: (34:40)
Yes, sir. Right now, Mr. President, for priority patients, those in hospitals or those in nursing homes and hotspots, within one day we can turn them around. For everybody else across the country, we’ve turned those around in two to three days on average. And we can do 180,000 of those tests per day, and we’re still increasing capacity. And as Dr. Birx said, we’re going to be doing pooling and multiple other things. So we will continue to work hard.
Donald Trump: (35:05)
So then for nursing homes, one day. And something more than that for everyone else. But three days looks like it’s a pretty good target.
Adam: (35:15)
On average, two to three days. So we shoot for two to three days. So we can get it to two days on average-
Donald Trump: (35:19)
Well, that’s very good. Would be happy with those numbers. And numbers that we are happy with and we use a certain test around here that goes very quickly. And it’s just been recently developed so we’ve done an amazing job. Everybody at this table has done really an amazing job in coming up with testing and testing that works. Steve, go ahead.
Steve: (35:42)
One issue that has come up is once you do have a vaccine, how do you properly distribute it? How do you get it out quickly?
Donald Trump: (35:51)
Well, when we have the vaccine, we have the military all lined up. And the military is going to be doing it in a very powerful manner. These are people that don’t usually do vaccines, they do soldiers, and they do lots of other things that frankly are more difficult, but we have a general. And logistically, he’s all set. Tony, do you want to say something about that?
Dr. Anthony Fauci: (36:14)
That is correct. As the vaccine rolls out, we’ll be getting them distributed. And as you probably have heard, we are going to make sure that we do it in an equitable way and it’s representative of the populations who need it the most. And we have the standard way that we determine that with the ACRP working with the CDC. But Dr. Collins and Dr. Redfield have put together, with the National Academy of Medicine, a group that will fortify that decision making process so that we’re making sure that we’re very fair and equitable in getting the vaccine distributed properly.
Donald Trump: (36:52)
And I think I could have Francis say that tremendous progress has been made on the vaccine beyond anything that we would have thought if you go back six months. What do you think?
Francis Collins: (37:02)
It is just frankly quite astounding, Mr. President, I’ve been at NIH for 27 years and Director for 11. And I’ve seen some amazing things happen. But the way in which the whole research community, public and private, philanthropies, everybody has come together to work on this, not worrying about who gets the credit, trying to figure out how to strip away anything that’s going to slow things down. And I think all of us, motivated by the fact that this is the most serious problem we’ve encountered in our professional lifetimes, even a day matters. And so that’s why a lot of people look kind of sleepy because we’re all working 24/7 trying to make sure that nothing possibly slows this process down.
Francis Collins: (37:44)
Yeah, the vaccines, this week, it’s a big week, as you just heard, having two phase three trials started in the very same day, this past Monday. And based upon very impressive phase one data showing that people who got that in the phase one trials developed these high levels of neutralizing antibodies that should be very predictive of protection, but you don’t know until you actually run the trial in those 30,000 people.
Francis Collins: (38:09)
By the way, you heard earlier about coronavirus.gov, which is the place you can go to to find out how you can donate plasma. There’s another thing you can do if you go to that website, which is to sign up to say you’re interested in a vaccine trial. And we need people to volunteer for that as well because we’re going to, with these four or five trials coming along very quickly, each of which needs 30,000 volunteers, that’s a lot of people and we need them.
Donald Trump: (38:34)
And Francis, we’re working very well with other countries.
Francis Collins: (38:37)
We are indeed. And science has always international and it certainly is right now. And we work with our colleagues in Europe, and the UK, and Asia in a way that I think represents the best of the best. And again, everybody recognizes we’re all in this together across the whole planet.
Donald Trump: (38:53)
Okay. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
"Jul 29, 2020",Uknown,"President Trump: (00:00)
Thank you, Cody. Good job you did Cody. He was [inaudible 00:08:57] but he’ll be up there very soon. He’s doing good. Come on sit down please. Let’s have some fun. I really am thrilled to be here in Midland, Texas with the extraordinary men and women of Double Eagle Energy, and what a nice welcome. Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:09:18] big beautiful rigs behind me. Thanks to the hard working citizens like you in United States Of America this is now the number one energy superpower anywhere in the world, so congratulations. It’s not that easy, but no one said it’s easy. We’re here today to celebrate your incredible achievements, we are also here to send a clear message to the Zealots radicals and extremists trying to shut down your and to make America subservient to foreign producers. That won’t happen to this nation again. Long time to be independent and.
President Trump: (10:02)
A long time to be independent, and as long as I’m your president, we will never let anyone put American energy out of business, which is what they’d like to do. We will never again be relying on hostile foreign suppliers. We will defend your jobs and we will defend the Lone Star State, I love this state. We will defend Americans who found energy independence. Before going any further I want to provide you with a brief update on our battle against the China virus. Our hears are with the people of Texas. We love our people. We love our country. Statewide presentive patients testing positive has stabilized, and the number of new cases has begun to substantially decline. But Texans must remain vigilant.
President Trump: (10:59)
To protect our seniors my administration has deployed personal protective equipment and rapid point of care testing systems to every Medicare and Medicaid-certified nursing home in your state. No matter where you go they have it.
President Trump: (11:15)
This week, access hospitals are receiving 500 cases of antiviral treatment remdesivir. It’s been very, very successful. Enough to treat 3200 patients.
President Trump: (11:29)
Under my administration’s Operation Warp Speed, we’re developing vaccines in record time. Earlier this week, a promising vaccine entered the final stage of clinical trials long ahead of schedule, with more following very quickly behind. We have some of the greatest companies, labs in the world doing this. This is the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. Together we will end the plague from China. We will defeat the virus.
President Trump: (12:07)
I want to thank everyone at Double Eagle Energy for hosting us today, including co-founders, two great, young, smart people, Cody Campbell and John Sellers. Thank you, Cody. Thank you, John. Thank you fellas. Good job.
President Trump: (12:26)
Thanks also to anterior secretary David Bernhardt. David, thank you. Energy secretary Dan Brouillette, Texas says keep him, we really kept him very busy. Where’s Dan? You’ve been kept very busy, very busy. A great Senator and a great friend of mine, Senator Ted Cruz. Ted, thank you. He’s out there fighting for you. I want to tell you. Thank you Ted.
President Trump: (12:56)
Representatives, and these are friends of mine and they’re warriors, Jodey Arrington and Mike Conaway, thank you fellas. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. A very, very special man and a very special talent, Governor Greg Abbott. Thank you. Thank you, Greg. Great job you’re doing. He’s working hard and you’re doing a fantastic job. Our people are working together and you’re getting everything you need. So good. Thank you for doing such a good job and thank also Dan Patrick, your Lieutenant governor, my friend. Thank you very much, Dan. Great help, great team. No better team in the country. Thank you. Midland County judge, terry Johnson. Thank you Terry. Thank you. Your former governor, a great man, a friend of mine, secretary of energy, Rick Perry. Nobody did a better job than my Rick. Thank you Rick.
President Trump: (13:58)
We have so many other distinguished guests and local leaders and we just want to thank you all for being here. Thank you all very much. Great honor. Thank you very much for being here.
President Trump: (14:09)
Under the last administration, America’s energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack, you know that. But the day I took the oath of office, we ended the war on American energy and we stopped the far left assault on American energy workers. Now the assault, you’ve seen what’s going on. It could come again. But I have a very strong feeling you’re not going to have to worry about it. If you do you’re in big, big trouble.
President Trump: (14:40)
I withdrew from the one-sided, energy destroying Paris Climate Accord. It was a disaster. It cost us billions of dollars and it would have made us a noncompetitive nation.
President Trump: (14:54)
We canceled the Obama administration’s job crushing clean power plan. You know all about that. I improved the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline immediately upon assuming office. We opened up ANWR in Alaska to energy exploration, ended the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands and reopened public lands and offshore areas to oil and gas exploration. That’s where David Bernhardt’s done such a great job. Thanks David. We unlocked the full energy potential of Texas and New Mexico, and New Mexico, we’re proud that we’ve been here. We’re proud to help. You have been fantastic. A lot of jobs.
President Trump: (15:41)
Since my election oil and gas production in the Permian Basin has more than doubled. Under the Trump Administration the United States has increased oil production by 3.1 million barrels per day. That’s some number, never been anything like that number. For the first time in nearly 70 years, we have become a net energy exporter, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the earth.
President Trump: (16:20)
To ensure we maintain this dominant position long into the future, we will never lose this position, my administration is announcing today that export authorizations for American liquified natural gas can now be extended through the year 2050. Mr. Governor is that long enough? Okay, 2050, that seems like a long time. He said let’s make it longer.
President Trump: (16:54)
At the same time, we’re strongly protecting our environment. Air pollution is down significantly since I took office. While other countries are polluting the world’s air and oceans, we will never cease to be a leader in protecting our natural environment and that’s what’s happening. People don’t know that about us. We love our environment. Under my administration the United States will continue to have among the cleanest air and cleanest water anywhere on earth and that’s what we have.
President Trump: (17:29)
Thanks to our pro- American energy policies, we’re also taking jobs in factories away from countries with poor environmental standards, such as China, and bringing jobs back to America, where they belong. Before the invisible enemy struck our shores, we created 800,000 new energy jobs, a third of them in Texas. That was just the new jobs. Add onto that millions of other jobs. After the China virus struck we implemented historic economic relief. When oil crashed, I got Saudi Arabia, Russia and others to cut nearly ten million barrels a day and got OPEC plus and Mexico to agree to the deal and hence we’re okay. Now we’re back. We’re back. I will tell you, and I can tell you that I spoke with Dan and Greg and I spoke with Senator Ted Cruz, I spoke with a lot of people and we were very close to losing a very powerful, great industry, and we did a job. We did a great job all together, working together, a job like I think nobody could have done, and now we’re back and now we’re just going to keep expanding.
President Trump: (18:48)
You will see. It’s happening, but we really did. We did a great job and I want to thank, frankly, Saudi Arabia. I want to thank Russia. I want to thank Mexico, and I want to thank OPEC as they call it, Plus. It’s called OPEC Plus. That’s OPEC, Plus a lot of other countries. But they all came to together and they did a job for the industry and we appreciate everybody’s help.
President Trump: (19:12)
This action stabilized world oil prices that had been in a free fall and saved millions of energy jobs, and frankly it saved your industry. Four months ago people were very, very concerned about that industry, and now it’s just going to be a question of how fast will you put people on.
President Trump: (19:31)
Through the Paycheck Protection Program we provided over one billion dollars in emergency aid to keep Texas energy workers on the payroll. We kept them all in the payroll. We opened up 30 million barrels of space in Strategic Petroleum Reserve, allowing American companies to store surplus oil to be sold at a later time, and we filled up our 75 million barrels in the Strategic Reserve. And Dan, you’ve done a fantastic-
President Trump: (20:03)
In the strategic reserve and Dan you’ve done a fantastic job on that. Thank you very much.
President Trump: (20:09)
I only wish he bought it when the oil was selling for zero and they paid you $37.00 in addition. You get a barrel plus $37.00, I said, “Dan, why didn’t you make that deal?” I would have loved that, but you did well. Thank you very much.
President Trump: (20:24)
Today I’m taking another bold action to support energy jobs in Texas. In a few moments, I will sign four critical permits granting approval to vital pipeline and railway infrastructure on our nation’s border. That’s a big deal, this will include two permits allowing the export of Texas crude to Mexico, a giant victory for the workers of this state that you’ve been after for many years, right? You’ve been after that one for many years. I said, “What do I know about it? If you want to do it, it’s okay with me,” and we’re doing it, so that’s been a long time in the making.
President Trump: (21:04)
We’re joined today by some of the incredible patriots of the Texas oil and gas industry who are benefiting from America’s energy boom. Josh [inaudible 00:21:15] was born and raised right here in Odessa and Midland, where’s Josh? Thank you Josh. After spending a few years away at school, Josh came back home to West Texas. Josh’s dad worked on the oil rigs. Josh worked on the oil rigs and he hopes his three children will work one day doing the same kind of incredible work and looking for the wonderful opportunities in American energy. Josh, thank you very much. Congratulate your family. You’re going to have a great future. Thank you. Appreciate it.
President Trump: (21:51)
Brian Welch spent five years in the army, supporting our victory in the Gulf War. Then he became … Hello, Brian. Thank you Brian. Then he became an energy worker. Did you make the right move, Brian? I think so, right? Better believe it. With over 25 years of experience, Brian, a senior pumper with Double Eagle Energy, do they treat you well? They better, they better, I’m going to come back and see those two guys. Just like thousands of other veterans who work in this industry, Brian has made America safer with his service and now he’s helping keep us secure by maintaining American energy independence which we have. Thank you very much Brian. Great job. To Brian and every veteran who works in the American energy sector, we salute your noble service and we thank you very much, we thank you very much, everybody, thank you.
President Trump: (22:50)
While my administration is fighting for workers like you, the radical left, have you ever heard of the radical left, Brian? You don’t want to hear about them. You don’t want to know about them, is fighting to abolish American energy, destroy the oil and gas industries and wipe out your jobs. Washington Democrats have embraced Representative Ocasio-Cortez’s nearly $100 trillion Green New Deal disaster. I have added the fourth word, it’s a disaster, which would ban oil and gas leasing on all federal lands and by the way there would be no fracking, so let me ask you Mr. Governor, how do you think that works in Texas? No fracking, no drilling, no oil, is that okay? Good. I don’t think Biden’s going to do too well in Texas. He’s already written it off, it’s gone. No fracking, that’s part of his platform. If these far left politicians ever get into power, they will demolish not only your industry but the entire U.S. economy. Their stated agenda includes rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, spending billions and billions of dollars in order to make us non-competitive, and seeking an even higher level of restrictions mandating net zero carbon emissions which frankly is impossible, for all new homes, offices and buildings by 2030, not possible to do, and if you ever did it, it would cost so much that your home would be valueless.
President Trump: (24:25)
This would cause the cost of construction to skyrocket and effectively end the use of natural gas in homes because it would be an impossible situation. They’re asking for things, just so you understand, that are impossible. I don’t know, I haven’t checked recently, what have they done with cows? Remember there were going to be no more cows and no more cattle. I think they might have left that one off the manifesto but it will be back. Their platform calls for mandating zero carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. In other words, no drilling, no fracking, no coal, no shale, no gas, no oil. Otherwise they’ve been very good to the industry I think. You got to be careful. People don’t take it seriously. If they got in, you will have no more energy coming out of the great state of Texas, out of New Mexico, out of anywhere. Oklahoma, North Dakota, name them. Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania does a lot. People don’t realize that, a lot. It would throw Pennsylvania, Ohio, so many other places, you don’t realize how big it is, they want to have no fracking, no nothing.
President Trump: (25:39)
The policies required to implement this extreme agenda would mean the death of American prosperity and the end of the American middle class. It would mean I think even worse than that. It would destroy our country. I used to say we would become another Venezuela, same ideology, you would become another Venezuela. Venezuela used to be one of the richest in the world per capita and period one of the richest in the world, among the largest oil reserves. Now they don’t have water, they don’t have medicine, they don’t have food, you got a lot of oil, it doesn’t matter. Doesn’t seem to matter. They don’t have anything, and that can happen to us. All you have to do is look at Portland, look at the agitators, look at the anarchists in Portland and our people have done a great job in protecting our courthouse and I told my people a little while ago, if they don’t solve that problem locally very soon, we’re going to send in the National Guard and get it solved very quickly just like we did in Minneapolis and just like we will do in other places. They want to solve their problem, they’ve got a very short time to do it, but they’ll either solve their problem or we send in the National Guard.
President Trump: (26:57)
The U.S. energy industry would grind to a halt and every single energy producing state would be plunged into a depression. Two million jobs would vanish overnight in just the state of Texas alone, and I think the number’s probably Greg a lot higher than two million. Millions more would disappear in New Mexico and Ohio and Colorado and Pennsylvania. By imposing these punishing restrictions and beyond restrictions, the Washington radical left crazy Democrats would also send countless American jobs, factories, industries to China and to other foreign polluting states. They want us to take care of our air but China doesn’t take care of its air. In all fairness, India doesn’t take care of its air. Russia doesn’t take care of its air, but we do. Not on my watch it’s not going to happen I can tell you that. Because as long as I’m president, we will always put America first. It’s very simple, very simple. For years and years we put other countries first. We now put America first.
President Trump: (28:13)
As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it’s not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy, they want to destroy our country. These people are sick. They are sick and you better get used to hearing it because they have some real problems. They don’t love our country. In any way, shape or form, they don’t love our country. There’s no respect for the American way of life. There is no way of life ever in history that’s been like the great American way of life. There’s no respect but there is by you and there is by 95% of our people. Our people love our country and our people love our anthem and they love our flag. Remember that. The radical left wants to tear down everything in its way and in its place they want power for themselves, they want power. Hard to believe, power. They want to uproot and demolish every American value. They want to wipe away every trace of religion from national life. They want to indoctrinate our children, defund our police, abolish the suburbs, incite riots, and leave every city at the mercy of the radical left. That’s not going to happen. That’s not going to happen. By the way, I just ended the rule on suburbs. You know the suburbs, people fight all of their lives to get into the suburbs and have a beautiful home. There will be no more low income housing forced in to the suburbs. I abandoned and took away and just rescinded the rule. It’s been going on for years, I’ve seen conflict for years. It’s been hell for suburbia.
President Trump: (30:02)
It’s been hell for suburbia. We rescinded the rule three days ago, so enjoy your life, ladies and gentlemen. Enjoy your life. The proud people of Texas will never bow, kneel or surrender to the left-wing mob. You will always stand tall and strong for America.
President Trump: (30:23)
Everyone here today carries the legacy of some of the toughest, fiercest, and most determined people ever to walk the face of the earth, your ancestors. You know that. You know that generations of Texas oil workers before you gave every last bit of sweat and heart and grit that they had to build up this country. They loved our country. They loved our country so much they couldn’t breathe. Their pride and devotion help raise up America cities, power our factories, propel our industries, sustain our families, supply our military and fuel America’s rise into the strongest, wealthiest and greatest nation the world has ever known.
President Trump: (31:14)
We are now at the strongest point militarily, we’ve ever been due to… I’ll tell you, Ted? Where is Ted? He was a big leader in this. Stand up again, Ted. Ted Cruz, John Cornyn, and our Senate and our House approved $2.5 trillion to rebuild entirely the United States military. It’s now at a point that it’s the strongest it’s ever been. A lot of the equipment is still coming in, brand new planes and missiles and everything you can think of. And I want to thank you, Ted. You were one of the real leaders, and John too. The two of you, I appreciate it very much. You are well-represented. We have the greatest equipment on earth. We have equipment that I can’t even tell you about. You don’t want to know about it, frankly, and hopefully we’d never have to use it.
President Trump: (32:08)
Now it’s your turn to help lead our nation to even greater heights. Today we give thanks for each and every one of you. And we are telling the Washington politicians trying to abolish American energy, don’t mess with Texas. And I just want to finish by saying that I’ve had a great relationship with your leaders, with your politicians. With all the people in Texas, we’ve had great success. We had a great victory. They said, “Oh, I don’t know if he’ll win.” And we won. Not only did we win, we won quickly and easily. And now we’re leading what we had even four years ago.
President Trump: (32:53)
I will never let you down. I will never let Texas down. And your governor and lieutenant governor and your senators, they know that very well. Thank you. And thank you very much, Greg. Dan, thank you very much. Ted, thank you. Great job. God bless you, and the great state of Texas, God bless you. God bless you.
President Trump: (33:16)
On behalf of every American energy worker, I will now sign these very important permits that your governor and your senators have been after me for a long time to sign. And they’ve been after a lot of other presidents to sign them, but they never were able to get it done. But we got it done. And we got it done for a great state called Texas. Thank you very much everybody.
President Trump: (33:37)
Where’s Greg? Greg, you there?
President Trump: (33:37)
Where’s Cruz?
Speaker 1: (33:37)
He’s right behind you. He’s right here.
President Trump: (35:58)
Let’s give this to the governor, okay. You want to give that to the governor. Here you go."
"Jul 27, 2020",Uknown,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
In the thereafter. Not only his Operation Warp Speed, accelerating the development of a vaccine, we’re also directing a colossal industrial mobilization to ensure its rapid delivery. Nothing’s happened like this since the end of World War II. Instead of the usual sequence of vaccine development, testing and trials, followed by production, our strategy is to conduct these phases simultaneously, so everything goes at one time. We’re not waiting and waiting and waiting. It’s all going at one time. We have a system that has, I think it’s unparalleled, has never been done before, but we suspect it’s going to work and work very well. We’re mass-producing all of the most promising vaccine candidates in advance so that on the day one, that it’s approved, it will be available to the American people immediately and we’ll probably have a lot for a lot of other people throughout the world.
Donald Trump: (00:57)
The world is suffering from this China virus. Another dimension of Operation Warp Speed, is our focus on therapeutics to treat the virus over 100, including Remdesivir, which is having a tremendous impact. You see that with mortality rates and other things, statistically. Dexamethazone, convalescent plasma and antibody treatments, we have numerous treatments right now that are under study. I think over the next couple of weeks, we may actually have some very positive answers as to that. On July 7th, we announced a $450 million agreement with Regeneron to begin advanced manufacturing of its antibody treatment, which is currently in late stage clinical trials, late stage. Due to the medical advances we’ve already achieved and our increased knowledge in how to treat the virus, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 18 is 85% lower than it was in April.
Donald Trump: (01:59)
Think of that. 85%, and it’s 25% lower than Europe as a whole. In the middle of April, more than 22% of all deaths in the United States were attributable to the China virus. As the last week, that number has dropped down. As of last week, it’s dropped down to under 7%. To decrease the turnaround times for testing, the first two laboratories have been approved to provide pooled testing. Very important. In other words, samples from multiple patients are processed together. They are pooled. Now, pool testing will reduce turnaround times by more than substantially, more than 50%. Last week, our centers for Medicare and Medicaid services began distributing rapid point of care, diagnostic test instruments to all of the nursing homes in the United States, focusing on the areas of greatest need, which is our elderly and our nursing homes.
Donald Trump: (03:00)
What we’ve already sent, includes testing instruments to 635 nursing homes for 196,000 rapid point of care tests. It’s a tremendous amount. That’s, you’ll get your response and answer from five to 15 minutes. Over the next three weeks, 1,700 nursing homes will receive an additional 800,000 point of care tests. Think of that. The United States has conducted over 52 million tests. That’s more than all of Europe put together times two. Nobody’s even close, and as countries go, it is as an example, India is up to 11 million tests. We’re going to be very shortly at 55 million tests. India has 1.4 billion people. Through our relentless efforts, ` we’ve completely rebuilt our stockpile, which the previous administration depleted and did not refill. The cupboards were bare. I say it often. In total, we’ve now distributed nearly 100,000,095 masks, 35 million surgical masks, 15 million face yields, and much, much more.
Donald Trump: (04:13)
In addition to that, ventilators, the most difficult thing of all, we are now building thousands a month and we’ll distribute them. We have all we need in our country, but to other countries that are in desperate need, other countries are having a tremendously difficult time with the virus. Last week, FEMA sent additional personnel protective equipment to over 15,000 nursing homes, including 643,000 pairs of protective eyewear, 7 million masks, 34 million pairs of gloves and 6 million gowns. It’s a lot. Over the weekend, cases in Florida, Texas and Arizona held steady and are now heading down. In Arizona they’re heading very substantially down and rapidly. We’ve been constant and in constant communication with the states and are surging them resources, when requested. They largely had what they needed, but anything they need, we send them immediately. We are totally full. We have everything we need. We get it to the states immediately.
Donald Trump: (05:18)
We deal with the governors. The relationship with the governors has been very good. These states are not out of the woods, but rigorous compliance with guidelines should allow them to turn the corner, and very, very quickly. We are working with every governor and health commissioner, across the country to bring a complete, individualized analysis to each state, as well as tailored recommendation. States are different. My administration is also closely monitoring the surging caseload in Latin America, which is now the region in the world with the most active reported infections by far. Due to the relative scarcity of testing in Latin America however, the regions reported number of cases is also likely to be dramatically undercut or under-counted. I can say that’s probably true throughout the entire world. We report our cases. Most of the world doesn’t. They either don’t do testing, therefore they have very few cases, even though people are sick or they just don’t report.
Donald Trump: (06:20)
Given the reality of what we just said, we’re focusing aggressively on the Texas border and countries that we think have to be watched very, very carefully, because you have some very, very highly-infected countries outside of our borders. I’ve spoken with Governor Abbott, terrific gentlemen, and I can report that over 3,300 federal personnel are on the ground in Texas. We’ve given them a tremendous amount of extra help, including doctors, nurses, frontline people. We’ve supplied Texas with more than 2.5 million gloves, 800,000 goggles, 337,000 surgical gowns, 1.8 million surgical masks, 1.36 million N95 respirators and half a million KN90 masks. Beginning this week, Texas hospitals, will receive 500 cases of Remdesivir, which has proven very effective, enough to treat 3,200 patients. In addition to the cross border spread, the stage of the pandemic is being fueled by younger Americans who generally have little risk of being seriously harmed by the disease, but can spread the disease.
Donald Trump: (07:42)
We need all Americans to be conscious about their actions and to exercise extreme vigilance. I trust all Americans to do the right thing, but we strongly advise everyone to especially, especially focus on maintaining a social distance, maintaining rigorous hygiene, avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor bars and wear masks when appropriate. We also strongly urge citizens to take extra precautions, to shield those at highest risk, which are in most cases, in many cases, the elderly, especially the elderly with medical problems, such as heart or diabetes. But you want to shield them and you want to guard them and you want to protect them from the virus, especially, especially those that are really targeted, almost targeted, you could say, by this horrible, horrible plague, this horrible epidemic pandemic. America will develop a vaccine very soon and we will defeat the virus. We will have it delivered in record time as our visit here demonstrates.
Donald Trump: (08:50)
I want to thank all of the people and representatives from the great state of North Carolina. Is a great place. It’s a phenomenal place. We’ve had so many great meetings and such a great time. I want to drive into the drive and tenacity of your representatives and your politicians has been incredible. When they call, I’m there. When they call, most of them, many of them are sitting here right now. I will always answer their call. Thank you very much. I appreciate you being here with us and let’s get onto a few questions. Tremendous progress has been made and it’s been made rapidly and it’s been made in areas that nothing like that has taken place before. Please, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 3: (09:41)
There’s been a lot of despair when it comes to the virus. Is today’s event about giving Americans hope, a sense of optimism? Is that what you’re trying to do?
Donald Trump: (09:53)
Well, I think so. But there would be not that same kind of hope if we weren’t doing so well where, before, just before I left the White House in the Oval Office, we had a meeting with our doctors, scientists, some others, and they’re making tremendous progress with respect to therapeutics. I can tell you therapeutically, I think over the next couple of weeks, we’ll have some really very good things to say. We’re just having great answers. It is about that. It’s also the vaccine that we discussed today at even greater length, is just coming along really well. It’s not just one company. It’s many companies have had tremendous progress. That’ll be announced over the next very short period.
Speaker 5: (10:35)
When do you expect the vaccine to be ready for the Americans to-
Donald Trump: (10:35)
Well, I heard very positive things, but by the end of the year, we think we’re in very good shape to be doing that. By the end of this year, we’re going to, in terms of the vaccine, I think in terms of therapeutics, even sooner than that. Therapeutics, meaning you go and you give somebody, whether it’s transfusion or shots or whatever it may be, and they heal and they heal quickly. We’ve had tremendous progress. We already have, if you look at Remdesivir and you look at some of the other things, but we’ll have some announcements on that over the next two weeks. Yeah, it is hope, but it’s only hope because we’ve gotten such incredible results, scientifically.
Speaker 5: (11:15)
One final question.
Donald Trump: (11:17)
Yeah.
Speaker 5: (11:17)
You did talk with Russian President, Vladimir Putin. I wanted to ask, if you did bring up the reports of Russia, having [inaudible 00:11:24] on our soldiers, in Afghanistan.
Donald Trump: (11:25)
We don’t talk about what we discussed, but we had plenty of discussion and I think it was very productive. Please.
Speaker 7: (11:32)
Larry Kudlow, earlier today said that the V-shape recovery is showing signs of moderating. Do you think given what we’re seeing with the increase in cases that the recovery could be in jeopardy at all, the economic recovery?
Donald Trump: (11:43)
I don’t think so. I think the recovery has been very strong. We’ve set record job numbers. We’ve set record numbers, whether it’s a pure V or a little bit less than that, I think it’s going to be very good. If therapeutically, we come up with some answers very quickly, which I think we will, then you’re going to have a tremendous recovery, likewise, with the vaccines. If you do that by the end of the year, that’s ahead of schedule, substantially ahead of schedule and it’s ahead of anything that’s ever taken place in terms of vaccines before. I think if those things happen, if just one of those events happen, you’ll go right back into that V and I think you’re probably in the V anyway,. I really do believe a lot of the governors should be opening up states that they’re not opening. We’ll see what happens with them, but a lot will have to do with the fact that therapeutically, I think you’re going to have some great answers, vaccine-wise, likewise. Yeah. Please go ahead. In the back.
Zachary Eanes: (12:37)
Zachary Eanes, from the Raleigh News and Observer. Now that you’ve canceled the Jacksonville portion of the RNC, do you think Governor Cooper made the right choice to limiting attendance in Charlotte?
Donald Trump: (12:48)
Well, we’re actually coming to North Carolina as you know. We’re having a very major, I guess that would be the nomination night. That’s a Monday. That’ll be Monday. They’re going to be here and the rest we’ll do in a different form. We could have done it many different ways, but I think we did the right thing and I’m really happy that we’re going to be having a piece of it, at least in a very important piece in North Carolina. Yes, please go ahead.
Speaker 9: (13:14)
Mr. President, your poll numbers suffered in recent months because of your handling on this pandemic. You’re here now today. What’s your plan going forward to prove to Americans that you’re the right person?
Donald Trump: (13:24)
I think the poll numbers are very good. The poll numbers we have are very good. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in Arizona, our numbers. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading nicely in Florida. I think our poll numbers are very good. We’re leading substantially in Georgia. I mean, we get a lot of suppression polls. We get a lot of fake polls, just like we have fake news. I mean, it’s a terrible thing when you look at it. But I had the same thing four years ago. I was losing everywhere. I had poll numbers where I wasn’t going to win any state. I ended up winning every one of them. The swing States, I wasn’t going to win any of them and I want all of them. I have the same thing this year. This year, they have it even closer.
Donald Trump: (14:06)
They have it closer, but it’s the same suppression-type polls. We have polls that show me leading in almost every swing state and substantially in other states, by even more than I won in ’16. When you look at Florida as an example, you have thousands of boats out of the ocean, out on the Intercoastal. You look at other states, where likewise, you have thousands of boats and their all waving the Trump sign, Trump/Pence sign, and they’re so proud. Thousands and thousands. You have seen it where you have bikers for Trump with lines that are miles long on highways going along on weekends. I think there’s more spirit now than there’s ever been for my campaign. That includes 2016, where obviously, there was great enthusiasm, great spirit. We had great spirit. I think there’s more today because what we’ve done nobody’s ever done before.
Donald Trump: (15:01)
Nobody has ever rebuilt the military, cut taxes, the most in our history, created the greatest economy we’ve ever had, cut regulations at a level that nobody’s ever done. All of these different things, the VA, we got VA choice. We got VA, everything for the VA right now. They had a 91% approval rating. In a recent poll, I was just speaking to the secretary. 91% in the VA, that’s never happened before. I think when people see all that we’ve done, even Space Force, we created a force that actual, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, right? It’s pretty amazing. Coast guard. Now, Space Force. That hasn’t happened in 75 years. What we’ve done, working with some of those warriors over there, by the way, but what we’ve done has never been done. If you look at Alaska with ANWR, perhaps the biggest drilling site in the world. Even Ronald Reagan and Bush and Clinton, everybody wanted to get it done.
Donald Trump: (16:03)
I got it done. ANWR in Alaska, probably, or possibly the biggest drilling site in the world. Now, what we’ve done has been incredible. Recently, it looked like the energy business was going to be a catastrophe. We were number one in the world, and then we had the pandemic and nobody was using energy. Nobody was driving in automobiles, no gasoline. By the way, gasoline prices for everyone, a very, very low. In many cases, less than $2. That’s pretty incredible. I saved the energy business. I got Russia and I got Saudi Arabia on the phone and they cut way back and we’re now at $40 and plus a barrel. We’re saving tens of millions of jobs in energy. We’re the number one in energy in the world. With all that we’ve done, we made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history.
Donald Trump: (16:54)
We never had an economy like we had prior to the China plague or China virus coming in. We never had numbers like it. We are going to have them again, and everyone knows I’m going to rebuild it. I had to close it up. We saved millions of lives by closing it. If we didn’t close I,. You would have seen numbers that would have been 15 times what you have right now. One death is too much, but it would have been 10 to 15 times, maybe more than that, what you have. We closed this greatest economy ever, far bigger than China, better than China. China was having, by the way, the worst year they had in 67 years. Tariffs, they paid us tens of billions of dollars. The worst year they’ve had. Think of it. In 67 years. We were having the best year we’ve ever had. I had to close it and now we’re reopening it. Next year we’ll be stronger. It’ll be the strongest year so far. It’ll be better even than last year.
Donald Trump: (17:46)
Okay. Thank you very much. I’ll be heading back. I’ll see you back at the White House. Thank you very much. We’re going to take an additional tour of the facility with your great leaders. Thank you very much to the people of North Carolina. We love being here. Thank you."
"Jul 23, 2020",4:17 P.M. EDT,"President Donald J. Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. We’ve had a tremendous week uniting the country in our fight against the China virus. I’ve reminded people of the importance of masks when you can’t socially distance, in particular. A strong message has been sent out to young people to stop going to crowded bars and other crowded places. Yesterday, we made the amazing announcement for our plans to protect nursing home residents. We’re working very hard on that. We’re doing very well all over the country, and also about contracting with Pfizer. We made a big, big, beautiful contract with Pfizer. We think they’re very close, but we have a lot of companies that are very close to produce a vaccine. And I wanted to come out again today to share some additional news with you.
President Donald J. Trump: (11:01)
This afternoon, my political team came to me and laid out our plans for the convention in Jacksonville, Florida. It’s a place I love and I love that state. The drawings look absolutely beautiful. I never thought we could have something look so good so fast with everything going on. And everything was going well. A tremendous list of speakers, thousands of people wanting to be there, and I mean, in some cases desperately be there. They wanted to attend. People making travel arrangements all over the country. They wanted to be there. The pageantry, the signs, the excitement were really, really top of the line. But I looked at my team and I said, “The timing for this event is not right. It’s just not right with what’s happened recently, the flare up in Florida, to have a big convention. It’s not the right time.” It’s really something that, for me, I have to protect the American-
President Donald J. Trump: (12:03)
… really something that for me, I have to protect the American people. That’s what I’ve always done. That’s what I always will do. That’s what I’m about. They said, “Sir, we can make this work very easily. We have great enthusiasm, incredible enthusiasm.” Even the polls say about the most enthusiasm they’ve seen. We can do this safely and we can do it responsibly. I said, there’s nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether that’s from the China virus or the radical left mob that you see in Portland, where I want to thank Homeland Security and others in law enforcement for doing a fantastic job over the last few days they went in. People were out of control for 51 days, long time, and Homeland Security and other law enforcement with us went in and they’ve done a great job in protecting our property, federal courthouse and other property.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:01)
And most importantly, protecting our people. Or the senseless violence that you see in Chicago or New York or Detroit. A lot of other cities where so many people are shot and so many people are killed. People elected me to help and to protect. So I told my team it’s time to cancel the Jacksonville, Florida, component of the GOP Convention. We’ll be starting in North Carolina for the Monday as has always been planned. We were never taking that off. That’s remaining as it is. The delegates are going to get together. That’s where they do their nomination. So the delegates are going to North Carolina and they’ll be doing the nomination.
President Donald J. Trump: (13:47)
We’re going to do some other things with tele-rallies and online the week that we’re discussing, which will be really good. I think we’re going to do it well. I’ll still do a convention speech in a different form, but we won’t do a big crowded convention per se. It’s just not the right time for that. I care deeply about the people of Florida and everywhere else, frankly, in this country and even in the world who would be coming into the state, and I don’t want to do anything to upset it. They’ll be doing very well very shortly. We’re going to put some maps up of the country behind me. You’ll see that the area that we’re talking about is a hotspot. You’ll also see a lot of the country has no problem whatsoever, most of the country actually.
President Donald J. Trump: (14:38)
So I’m always going to take care of you so that that’s the way we’re going to do it. I’ve spoken to Governor DeSantis and informed other political leaders. I want to thank the Jacksonville community, and it’s great merries. Really great guy. They wanted it so badly, and all of the other political representatives in Jacksonville and in Florida. Just very special people, a very special group, and they were there for us 100%.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:12)
Today I want to provide an update on the actions we’re taking to support the safe reopening of America schools. Parents around the world who have had their children home for the last few months have a greater appreciation for the fact that teachers are essential workers, that they’re essential to our children’s future. Our goal is to protect our teachers and students from the China virus while ensuring that families with high risk factors can continue to participate from home. Very important. The American Academy of Pediatrics has released guidance recommending that schools reopen.
President Donald J. Trump: (15:51)
It said, “Lengthy time away from school and associated interruption of supportive services often results in a social isolation, making it difficult for schools to identify and address important learning deficits as well as child and adolescent physical and sexual abuse, substance abuse, depression, and suicidal ideation. This in turn places children and adolescents at considerable risk of morbidity and of some cases, mortality. Beyond the educational impact and social impact of school closures, there’s been a substantial impact on food security and physical activity for children and for families.” So that’s very important and there’s a… either way, it goes both ways.
President Donald J. Trump: (16:46)
The National Education Association recently stated despite the momentous efforts of educators during the pandemic, online learning has never been an effective replacement for in-person learning and support. Being at the school, being on the campus is very, very important. One study estimates that due to school closures last spring, the average student will begin the school year roughly 35% behind in reading compared to the typical year, and more than 50% behind in math. That’s a big statement. According to McKinsey & Company, learning loss will probably be greatest among low income Black and Hispanic students. They’re the ones that are hit the hardest. We don’t want that happening.
President Donald J. Trump: (17:35)
30 million American students rely on schools for free and reduced meals. Over 70% of the students who receive mental health services do so through their schools. According to HHS, one in five reports allegedly having to do with child abuse. They have neglect, and these neglected cases are submitted by education personnel. So, people in the education world on the premises will be the ones that report neglect and other problems. When they see the children, they know if they’ve been neglected. They know if they’ve been hurt or harmed in any way, whether it’s at home or someplace else, but they see this at school. You don’t get to see that if you’re not going to school. It’s a big thing.
President Donald J. Trump: (18:26)
Fortunately, the data shows that children are lower risk from the China virus. Very substantially. When children do contact the virus, they often have only very mild symptoms or none at all, and medical complications are exceedingly rare. Those that do face complications often have underlying medical conditions. 99% of all China virus hospitalizations are adults and 99.96% of all fatalities are adults. That means that children are a tiny percentage, less than 1%, and even a small percentage of 1%. In a typical year, the flu results in more deaths of those under 18 in the United States that have been lost thus far to the coronavirus. Many different names. Many, many different names. The life of every child is sacred and must be protected. Our sole focus is the health and wellbeing of America’s children.
President Donald J. Trump: (19:34)
I have a very, very special person who loves children who’s I think one of the greatest athletes of all time. A lot of people say the greatest pitcher of all time, known as the relief pitcher. Could have been whatever he wanted. To some people, he is the greatest reliever of all time by far, substantially more saves than anybody else. In fact, he got the Presidential Medal of Freedom recently, and he… I’m reading off these stats. I knew he was the best, I knew he was great, but I didn’t know it was almost double anybody else.
President Donald J. Trump: (20:07)
But he’s a man who loves children. Has children, loves children, works hard with children. We’re going to go outside and be with some little leaguers. Mariano Rivera. He’s the Sandman, right? My wife said, “Darling, why do they call him the Sandman?” I said, “They play the song. He just puts the batteries to sleep.” And that’s exactly what happen. So, having Mariano here is a great honor. Thank you very much. I was talking about children and schools, and there’s nobody that’s done more than you have. Thank you very much, Mariano. Fantastic man.
President Donald J. Trump: (20:42)
Given these considerations, we believe many school districts can now reopen safely provided they implement mitigation measures and health protocols to protect families, protect teachers and to protect students. So we do have to protect the teachers and the families also. We have to remember that all families should be empowered to make the decision that is right for their own circumstance. This is especially important if a child has underlying health conditions or lives with a parent or grandparent who is at higher risk.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:15)
In cities or states that are current hotspots, and you’ll see that in the map behind me, districts may need to delay reopening for a few weeks. That’s possible. That’ll be up to governors. The decision should be made based on the data and the facts on the grounds in each community. But every district should be actively making preparations to open. Again, the children obviously have a very strong immune system. Maybe even as strong as yours. They seem to be able to fight it off and not have a problem. So, it’s pretty amazing actually. Great, great credit.
President Donald J. Trump: (21:57)
Our strategy to safely reopen schools mirrors our approach nationwide. As we race toward the completion of a vaccine and therapeutics, the responsible path is to shelter those at highest risk while allowing those at lower risk, much lower the case of young children, to resume work at school as long as everyone practices vigilant hygiene and social distancing. We want that. A permanent shutdown was never the strategy, which would ultimately lead to greater mortality and irreversible harms. We don’t want to do that. At the same time, we have to get our economy going. We had tremendous numbers issued yesterday. Housing prices, pricing of housing up 21%, the highest in history. It’s the highest number in history. Real estate housing went up 21%.
President Donald J. Trump: (22:55)
Today, the CDC will provide additional guidance for how schools can reopen safely. I hope that local leaders put the full health and wellbeing of their students first and make the right decision for children, parents, teachers, and not make political decisions. This isn’t about politics. It’s about something very, very important. This is not about politics. I even think it’s bad politics if you do the wrong decision, very bad politics. We’re asking Congress to provide $105 billion to schools as part of the next Coronavirus Relief bill. This funding will support mitigation measures such as smaller class sizes, more teachers and teacher aids, repurposing spaces to practice social distancing and crucially, mask wearing. This money is an addition to the $30 billion we secured for schools and universities earlier this year. That money we have, some is distributed and some is not distributed. If schools do not reopen, the funding should go to parents to send their child to public…
President Donald J. Trump: (24:03)
The funding should go to parents to send their child to public, private, charter, religious, or homeschool of their choice. The key word being choice. If the school is closed, the money should follow the student so the parents and families are in control of their own decisions. So we’d like the money to go to the parents of the student, this way they can make the decision that’s best for them. We cannot indefinitely stop 50 million American children from going to school, harming their mental, physical, and emotional development. Reopening our schools is also critical to ensuring that parents can go to work and provide for their families. The Council of economic advisers estimates that 5.6 million parents will be unable to return to work if schools do not reopen this year. It’s a tremendous problem. It’s a tremendous problem. Schools have to open safely, but they have to open. More than a dozen European countries, as well as South Korea, Taiwan, and many others have already reopened schools and cases have not risen. We can achieve the same goal if we unite together, follow the best medical practices, and apply common sense.
President Donald J. Trump: (25:20)
We’ll continue to support states and cities and the current hot spots in the south, southwest and west. The governors, I know them all. They’re all very, very capable. They’re doing a very good job. They’re working so hard. You wouldn’t even believe it. We have nearly 30,000 federal personnel deployed in the states that need assistance. We’re helping with doctors and nurses, medical personnel of all kinds. As a PPE update, we’re in close communication with governors and states. We have supplies, everything they could possibly need. We’re very strong on supplies. You remember I used to say the cupboards were bare? Well, now the cupboards are the opposite. Due to our historic efforts to increase both the national stockpile and the state stockpiles, the vast majority of the states have 60 days worth of supplies on hand.
President Donald J. Trump: (26:13)
And most importantly, they have ventilators because the ventilators are very, very hard to come by, at least in the past. Now we’re making thousands of ventilators a month and supplying them in many cases to other countries. For states that are making requests, we’re rapidly delivering. In the last 24 hours, FEMA has the deployed more than 1.5 million masks upon request, 1.7 million gowns, and 600,000, well, let me change that. We’ve created about 600,000 different supplies. We have 600 ventilators to Arizona, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Idaho, and Washington. I think the number is 600. We’re going to check that and we’ll give it to you in a little while, but we’ve got a stockpile of thousands of ventilators. I think we’ve sent out about 600 just recently.
President Donald J. Trump: (27:12)
The United States has now conducted more than 51 million tests, which is more than any other country in the world by far. Roughly half of the tests, or either the rapid point of care tests, which frankly solves a lot of problem and delay, five to 15 minutes instead of waiting for service both ways in both directions and then at the lab. But roughly half of them now, which is a tremendous increase, are five to 15 minute tests or tests done in a hospital where you get the results back in less than a day, some cases immediately.
President Donald J. Trump: (27:50)
We’re continuing to surge testing to current hot spots such as Miami and Phoenix to detect those with the virus and take steps to stop from spreading it further. There’s a copy of the map and you have it right behind me. That’s really very much indicating where the problems are. You see from that it’s in great shape, lots of it. The northeast has become very clean. The country is in very good shape, other than if you look south and west, some problems. That’ll all work out. On therapies, we’ve worked with Florida to ensure that over 40,000 vials of Remdesivir are arriving this week. It’s a lot. That’s a lot. They’re working around the clock to make it a tremendous impact. We’ve also shipped thousands of vials to Arizona, California, and Texas over the past two weeks. Arizona is doing very well. It’s heading down. Numbers are heading down. I think very quickly. Governor’s done a great job. They’ve all done a great job. They’ve all done a great job. Working hard.
President Donald J. Trump: (29:03)
We’ll continue to monitor the areas rising and with respect to cases, and we ask all Americans to exercise vigilance, practice social distancing, wear a mask, do whatever is necessary so we get rid of this horrible situation, this horrible disease that was sent to us by China. It should not have been sent. They should have stopped it. They could’ve stopped it. They didn’t. And the entire world has gotten infected and a lot of countries are going through a lot right now. This morning, I spoke with President Putin of Russia, and they’re going through a very hard time with this in Moscow in particular. I spoke to the Crown Prince Saudi Arabia. They’re doing well, but they’re going through a lot. Everybody’s going through a lot. Yesterday I spoke to the heads of four different countries. All four are going through a lot, going through a hard time. This could have been stopped. It could have been stopped quickly and easily, but for some reason it wasn’t, and we’ll figure out what that reason was. So with that, if you have any questions, please.
Steve: (30:15)
On the convention, were you simply not convinced that you could keep people safe at the convention?
President Donald J. Trump: (30:17)
I just felt it was wrong, Steve, to have people going to what turned out to be a hot spot. You know, when we chose it, it was not at all hot. It was free. And all of a sudden it happened quickly. It happens quickly and it goes away and it goes away quickly. The key is we wanted to go away without a lot of death, without a lot of problems. And we’re learning so much about the disease. That’s why we’re very cognizant of nursing homes. We’re watching them very carefully, and people over a certain age, and especially people over a certain age with diabetes or heart disease in particular, but with a problem. So we didn’t want to take any chances. So we had a lot of people. The delegates want to be there.
President Donald J. Trump: (30:59)
We’re going to do a fairly reasonably quick meeting in North Carolina. The nomination will be produced. And then we’ll announce what we’re doing, how we’re doing it, whether it’s something that’s done online, I guess, you could call it online. So there could be nothing like our last convention, unfortunately. That was a great convention in a great place, as you know. We had a great time, great time in Cleveland, but it’s a different world, and it will be for a little while. We want to get the world back to what it was. And I think we’ll have that including great job numbers, including so many things that are happening so positive. I have to say the stock market is close to records. For NASDAQ, it is a record. That’s already exceeded its highest numbers, but we want to get our country back to what it was.
Steve: (31:58)
So will your acceptance speech be from the White House and are you worried that-
President Donald J. Trump: (31:58)
We haven’t set that yet, Steve. We’ll probably announce that over the next few days.
Steve: (32:05)
Are you worried this might dampen enthusiasm for you?
President Donald J. Trump: (32:05)
Look, we’ve done a great job. We built the greatest economy in the world. Nobody close, not China, not anybody. We had to close it. We saved millions of lives and we opened it. But we had the best numbers in history for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, every group you want to name, young people without a diploma, young people with a high school diploma, with a college diploma, anything you want to name, we had the best numbers. Women doing incredibly. Never been a time like that. And we had to turn it off because of what China did. We had to turn it off. And then all of a sudden, now we turn it back on and we’re doing very well, but it was very bad.
President Donald J. Trump: (32:50)
China, speaking about China, the trade deal means less to me now than it did when I made it. When I made it was a great deal, but they’re setting records. Yesterday was a record corn day. They purchased more corn than any order ever. And that went on for two or three days, and soybeans and all. But it just means much less to me. Can you understand that? It just means much less to me. Please. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: (33:19)
Thank you. What was the one thing, if there was one thing, that changed your mind about the convention and did Florida officials ask you to cancel it?
President Donald J. Trump: (33:23)
No, they didn’t. We’re dealing with them, but they didn’t. I would just say safety, just safety. I could see the media saying, “Oh, this is very unsafe.” I don’t want to be in that position. It’s safety. Not because of the media, but that’s what they would say, and we’ll have a very nice something. We’ll figure it out. It’ll be online in some form. Maybe it’ll be something even a little bit different. We have time. We’re talking about the end of August, but I think it’ll be something that will be exciting, but there can be nothing like having 25,000 people. We had a tremendous thing planned, a tremendous convention planned in North Carolina. And it would have been very good, but a much smaller version in Florida. But then we saw what was happening pretty quickly. We saw that the virus was coming up that coast. So.
Steve: (34:16)
Do you think it’s an ackowledgement of the severity of the situation in Florida?
President Donald J. Trump: (34:20)
No, I think it’s going to come and go. It will. I mean, you take a look at some of these locations were heavily infected, I mean, to a point where Deborah and I were talking that when you look at what happened in New York and what happened in New Jersey and other places, and now you’re looking and it’s gone. Hope it stays gone. I think it will. But we have to be vigilant. We have to be careful. And we also have to set an example. I think setting the example is very important. It’s hard for us to say we’re going to have a lot of people packed in a room and then other people shouldn’t do it.
President Donald J. Trump: (34:58)
Don’t forget, we’re talking about schools and we want them to be vigilant. And we’re saying open, and then we’re saying here, you have a big room, but I also, if you notice, I said, where bars are crowded, where other things are crowded. Well, there’s nothing more crowded than a convention. A convention, I mean, you’ve seen them. And even though you try and keep people away from each other, it’s just not that kind of a thing. They probably can’t do that. It just doesn’t work for them. So I think we’re setting an example by doing it. It’s very important. Yeah, John.
John: (35:27)
Mr. President, if I could come back to school openings. You talked about money that Congress is looking at to help schools who want to reopen. If school wants to reopen, but is concerned about testing, would you consider directing some of that money toward testing for either a school district or even individual schools if that’s what it took to open the school?
President Donald J. Trump: (35:47)
Yeah, I think so. I mean, a lot of people feel differently about testing. We talk about it a lot. When we have 50 million tests plus, and we broke the 50 million tests mark. Second in the world is India, which has 1.4-
President Donald J. Trump: (36:03)
… second in the world is India, which has 1.4 billion people, and they had 12 million tests. And other countries that are very big, had 2 million tests. And some countries, essentially only test if you’re sick and walk into a hospital, or walk into a doctor’s office, or you’re literally really sick, they essentially don’t do tests unless you’re sick. And I understand that too. So, if they feel that that’s what they want, it’s… That would be fine.
John: (36:29)
You would tell Congress… You would encourage Congress to pay for testing [crosstalk 00:00:32]?
President Donald J. Trump: (36:33)
I would, if they want. Again, we’ve done 50 million tests, there’s nobody even close in the whole world. You look at our mortality rate, you look at our death rate, you look at different statistics, we’re doing very well. But, one death is too many. This should never have happened, this should never have been allowed to happen from China.
John: (36:51)
Also, Mitch McConnell’s office just put out a statement a moment ago about the Phase 4 relief package, CARES 2, saying, “It’s tailored precisely for this phase of the crisis.” Yet it does not include your payroll tax cut. So, do you believe it’s perfectly balanced?
President Donald J. Trump: (37:06)
Yeah, I’d like to see a payroll tax cut, I think is great for the workers. The Democrats would never have gone for it. They don’t want it. They’re not big into the workers, I guess. And based on that, I told them last night, I told the Republicans who have been working very hard on this, I’ll tell you, and they want what’s right for the country. And hopefully, the Democrats ultimately will. But I said, “I think a payroll tax would be good.” But you’re not going to get it from the Democrats, we need their votes as you know. It’s not like… We have a majority, but it’s not enough that we… That’s why, I guess, we have an election coming up. So, you still need Democrat votes, and we’re not going to get the Democrat votes on that. So I’d like to see it, I think it would be very good for the workers. But, if we’re not going to get their votes, I guess we have to go onto the next thing. A payroll tax cut would have been very good. And maybe something happens. Yes, please.
Speaker 2: (37:53)
You talk about setting an example on Jacksonville, but I just wonder if some people are going to take away from this the lesson that you’re pushing too far, too fast. It seemed for a while the numbers were going up in Jacksonville and we were going to have a problem there. This comes up at a time you’re pushing for schools to reopen, we have the opening of the Major League Baseball season. Isn’t the example of Jacksonville that we’re pushing too fast?
President Donald J. Trump: (38:17)
Well, baseball, as an example, we were discussing a little while ago, you’re going to be at an empty stadium. I’ve agreed… Randy Levine is a great friend of mine from the Yankees, he asked me to throw out the first pitch. And I think I’m doing that on August 15th, at Yankee Stadium. And I say, “How’s the crowd going to be?” And it’s like you don’t have a crowd, there is no such thing. It’s going to be interesting, Mariano. He’s not used to that. I’ve been at many games, he walks in the place goes crazy. I think it’d be just as good without the crowd, you were just born with it, some people are born with it. I don’t know, this is only for the baseball players, but I’ve never seen a pitcher throw a ball where so many bats were broken as Mariano’s, he’s got the all- time record. I said, “How do you do that?” He said, “Great parents.” When you get right down to it, right? How do you do that? It’s called, parents. But-
Speaker 2: (39:08)
[crosstalk 00:03:07].
President Donald J. Trump: (39:09)
Yeah, just to finish. I think that we have to all set examples. I think Major League Baseball is setting an example by playing to empty stadiums and so are other sports, you see that. Now… Then they’ll allow a certain number in. I see golf is now… Soon will be allowing people to come in, in percentages. And all of a sudden, we want to get back to normal. The key is to get back to normal because nobody wants to see this. But, I think it’s really good that baseball is opening, it looks like football is opening, it looks like sports are opening. We have… it’s a tremendous thing, psychologically, for our country. And we’re all [inaudible 00:03:47]… We’re going to see, right now, some beautiful, young, Little Leaguers outside, with a great future ahead of them. They were already practicing on the front lawn of the White House. And we’re going to go out and say hello to them, and it’ll be really great. How about one more? Please, go ahead.
Speaker 3: (40:05)
President Trump, the Washington Post earlier today reported that one thing holding up the GOP coronavirus bill is the White House asking that it include language regarding the FBI building in downtown Washington, D.C., is that true?
President Donald J. Trump: (40:19)
I don’t know that they’re putting it in this bill. But, I know they want to have a new FBI building. This one is very old and it’s really… It was never built to a very high standard, as you probably have heard. And is got a lot of danger involved, and panels falling off the outside, and pieces of concrete falling off the building. And they want to build it at the site that they have it. They had options very far away from Washington. And I said to them, frankly, you have to be near the Justice Department. There’s nothing better than the site, the site they have now is better. But they were looking at sites in Maryland, and Virginia, and different places, but they would have been too far away. So, I have been encouraging them to build it. And if you’re going to… You have a choice. You can renovate the existing building, but it’s not a good building.
President Donald J. Trump: (41:03)
Or, you could take it down and build a great building for the FBI for a hundred years, and have it be incredible, even with tracks on top, they’re talking about. We have… Because, FBI people like to work out a lot. And you could have, literally, quarter mile tracks on top. It’s a very big site, very wide site. So, I think the idea… The best idea would be to build a new building and that way you have it for a long time. Renovation can never be as good as a new building, in that case. I know they’re talking about it, whether or not they put it in this bill or someplace else, but the FBI needs a new building and we’ll get it done. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much."
"Jul 16, 2020",Uknown,"Donald Trump: (00:17)
Hello everybody, thank you. Thank you very much everybody. Please. That’s a nice crowd on a nice cool day. It’s beautiful though. Might be hot but it’s beautiful. We’re here today to celebrate and expand our historic campaign to rescue American workers from job-killing regulations. Before I came into office, American workers were smothered by merciless avalanche of wasteful and expensive and intrusive federal regulation. These oppressive burdensome mandates were a stealth tax on our people, slashing take home pay, suppressing innovation, surging the cost of goods, and shipping millions of American jobs overseas. Millions and millions and millions, it never ended. Nearly four years ago, we ended this regulatory assault on the American worker and we launched the most dramatic regulatory relief campaign in American history by far. No other administration has done anywhere near. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:24)
At the heart of this effort was a revolutionary promise, for every one new regulation issued, we pledged that two federal regulations would be permanently removed. We not only met that ambitious goal which at the time people said was impossible, we vastly exceeded it. For every one new regulation added, nearly eight federal regulations have been terminated. Been an incredible achievement. As you can see behind me, we have removed the gigantic regulatory burden Americans have forced to carry for decades, freeing our citizens to reach their highest potential. Our historic regulatory relief is providing the average American household an extra $3,100.00 every single year and we’re going up from that number. We’re going up from that number. Think of that. $3,100.00 per household. Joining us today is Vice President Mike Pence. Thank you Mike. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Wilbur, thank you very much. Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, thank you, thank you [inaudible 00:02:43]. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Thank you Alex. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Thank you Elaine. We had a great day in Georgia yesterday, cutting regulations like nobody’s ever seen before. EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler, thank you Andrew, thank you very much. OMB acting director Russ Vought, thank you Russ, and Small Business administrator, I love her name, Jovita Carranza. Jovita, thank you, thank you, and CMS administrator Seema Verma, thank you Seema. Great people. Those are great people, they’re doing an incredible job. I also want to thank the many state and local, tribal leaders who join us in this great cause. Thank you very much and thank you for being here. We appreciate it. Thank you all very much. What we have achieved together is truly without precedent, never happened before. The previous administration added over 16,000 pages of heavy-handed regulations to the federal register. That’s why nothing got done. Under my administration, we have removed nearly 25,000 pages of job-destroying regulations, more than any other president by far in the history of our country, whether it was four years, eight years, or in one case, more than eight years. The prior administration piled up more than 600 major new regulations, a cruel and punishing regulatory burden that cost the average American an additional $2,300.00 per year. Think of that, the average American $ 2,300.00 regulation, hitting low-income Americans by far the hardest.
Donald Trump: (04:38)
These regulations also inflicted a steep economic toll on African-American communities. By contrast our reforms are putting more money into the pockets of hardworking Americans. In addition to saving every family more than $3,000.00 per year, my administration has just issued another reform that my council of economic advisors estimates will lower the price of new vehicles by more than $2,200.00 per vehicle and I think we’re going to get that up to $3,500.00 per vehicle. It’s very exciting, and by the way, the vehicles will be better, they’ll be stronger, and they’ll be safer. Our regulation cuts are also delivering massive savings on broadband internet services and some home energy bills will be really historically cut. It’s actually amazing, as well as historically low gasoline prices. Gasoline prices, you look today, I think it was $1.99. At the same time, we saved our oil companies. We are now the largest since we’ve been here, the largest energy source in the world. Nobody’s even close so it’s great but we saved them. They had a hard time a number of months ago and frankly for a long time but we’ve saved them. $1.99 they were telling me, in some cases lower than that.
Donald Trump: (06:06)
We’re bringing back consumer choice in home appliances so that you can buy washers and dryers, shower heads and faucets. So shower heads, you take a shower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer, you take a shower longer. Because my hair, I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect. Dishwashers, you didn’t have any water so the people that do the dishes, you press it and it goes again and you do it again and again. So you might as well give them the water because you’ll end up using less water. So we made it so dishwashers now have a lot more water and in many places, in most places of the country, water is not a problem. They don’t know what to do with it. It’s called rain. They don’t have a problem. And old-fashioned, incandescent light bulbs, I brought them back, I brought them back. They have two nice qualities, they’re cheaper and they’re better. They look better, they make you look so much better, that’s important to all of us, but they’re better and much cheaper and they were mandated out, legislated out, and we brought them back and they’re selling like hot cakes.
Donald Trump: (07:32)
We stopped the egregious abuse of the Clean Water Act which extreme activists have used to shut down construction projects all across our country. When I signed that legislation I had many farmers and construction people standing behind me. People that haven’t cried since they were babies, some of them never even when they were a baby and they were crying. Many people were crying. We gave them back their life. They took away their land, they took away their rights, they took away their life. By reigning in EPA overreach, my administration has returned the agency to its core mission of insuring clean air, clean water, and a truly pristine natural environment. Our air now and our water is as clean as it’s been in the last four decades. Yesterday our country achieved yet another groundbreaking milestone by completing a sweeping overhaul of America’s badly broken infrastructure approval process. It was totally out of control.
Donald Trump: (08:34)
Instead of taking up to 20 years to approve a major project, we’re cutting the federal permitting timeline, it’s already been done, to a maximum of two years or less, in some cases even less than one year. It’s possible that it won’t qualify, it’s possible that it won’t be good environmentally or safety-wise, in which case at least in a period of a year or two, we’ll raise the hand and you won’t make it, but most projects will make it but you won’t go for 10, 15, 18 or 20 years. There are many horror stories that we could relate.
Donald Trump: (09:11)
We’re reclaiming America’s proud heritage as a nation of builders. My administration has also eliminated massive regulatory barriers. In our battle against the China virus, these actions saved countless lives, speeding up the production of equipment. That means ventilators like nobody’s ever seen before. Probably the greatest source of manufacturing, the greatest achievement since World War II. We’re now making ventilators for countries all over the world.
Donald Trump: (09:44)
Medicine, accelerating the delivery of life-saving treatments and ensuring that we will have a vaccine in a record time. We’re doing fantastically well on that. That will be for another time, another meeting, but we are doing on therapeutics and vaccines incredibly well. No administration in history has removed more red tape more quickly to rescue the economy and to protect the health of our people. When you think of it, we are all set up, that as we get the vaccine or therapeutic, and we’re set up militarily, we’re going to be delivering it in record time. It’s all set to move. We put an investment upfront and we have logistical people, generals, great people. They’re going to be delivering this all over the country as soon as we have it and we’ve made tremendous progress, you’ve been reading about it.
Donald Trump: (10:36)
In total we’ve taken more than 740 actions to suspend regulations that would have slowed our response to the China virus. This includes lifting restrictions on manufacturers so that our great auto workers could produce more than 100,000 ventilators so we’ve done over 100,000 in 100 days. Think of that, and we didn’t have ventilators, we weren’t set up for ventilators. We became a country that’s making a lot of them. Helping so many others. Countries that are never going to be in a position to make them. They’re complex, they’re expensive, they’re big. Very, very, very tough to do and we’ve saved a lot of lives. There’s never been a person in our country, even though we started with almost nothing, I say the cupboard was bare when we took over, we started with nothing. There’s never been a person in our country, even though we had just absolutely … We were going on empty, never been one person that needed a ventilator that didn’t get it. Think of that. Not one person, as complex as they are, as big, as expensive. Take a long time to get them done. Not one person has ever needed a ventilator that didn’t get it. We made telemedicine, thank you. Great job. Great … Really a great job. The people here, they get no credit for it. I don’t want any credit, they should get
Donald Trump: (12:03)
People here, they get no credit for it, “I don’t want any credit.” They should get the credit, but they get no credit, but we’ve done a great job helping so many other countries now. We made telemedicine available to all American patients, and allowed doctors to work across state lines. I will tell you, the telemedicine is something that’s really gone up by thousands, and thousands of percentage points, of percent, because what happened is, people that wouldn’t even think of using telemedicine all of a sudden started using it, and it’s really turned out to be good. Really, really turned out to be good, and it solved a lot of problems, so that’s something that’s been great advancement.
Donald Trump: (12:40)
Furthermore, I’ve ordered federal agencies to look for ways to make these healthcare reforms totally permanent. Vice President Pence is also working closely with state, local, and tribal leaders to streamline occupational licensing. Over 30 states have taken steps to reduce these barriers to unemployment, and to employment, and including a state that I love very much. I have a little history in that state, the great state of Alaska. Thank you very much, governor, for being here, Mike Dunleavy. Mike, thank you very much
Donald Trump: (13:20)
In Idaho, governor Brad Little who is here today with us as well set a new record for regulatory relief. Good job, Brad. Good, good governor, great governor. Two great governors. The American people know best how to run their own lives. They don’t need Washington bureaucrats controlling their every move and micromanaging their every decision. With each regulation we cut, we’re not only returning the money, and the power to our citizens, we are draining the Washington swamp, and they’re not happy about it. I can tell you that. I think you know that.
Donald Trump: (14:04)
The swamp was deep. I just didn’t know how deep, deeper than I thought. Joining us today are a few of the countless Americans who are personally benefiting from our pro-worker reforms. Joe Cambria owns Cambria Truck Center in New Jersey, good state, New Jersey, and it’s been really something that he’s seen firsthand, how our regulation cuts have helped create thousands and thousands of jobs. Joe, please come up, and say a few words. Thank you, Joe.
Joe Cambria: (14:35)
Thank you Mr. President. Our company, Cambria Truck Center, [inaudible 00:14:48] since 1969, when my grandfather, uncle, and father started the business. In the past three and a half years, the Trump administration has kept its promise to right size regulations. I want to thank you for that, President Trump. Regulatory reform in the energy sector creates jobs, reduces costs for our communities, and puts trucks to work. Streamlined permitting, and creating an environment that allows for efficient construction, and infrastructure repair, and development has the same effect. As a result of these regulatory reforms, our industry has seen record sales of heavy duty trucks, which has been a boon to dealerships like ours, as well as the environment.
Joe Cambria: (15:37)
When new trucks replace older models, there is an environmental benefit. Current power trains have near zero emissions today, and we’re going to electric, as well as increased safety, like shorter stopping distances, and collision avoidance technology, safer on the road. It has also been nice to hear, “Made in the USA.” again. Bringing manufacturing back to our shores helps our industry, and our entire country. In short, when we cut red tape, we create an economy that is responsible and sensible. We as Americans all win. Thank you, President Trump.
Donald Trump: (16:16)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Good job, good job. That was easy. Wasn’t it? Thank you very much, great job. Dr. Amy Johnson is a nurse practitioner in rural Virginia. Amy, please come up and share with us how important expanded health care and telehealth has been for you, and your patients. Thank you. Thank you very much.
Dr. Amy Johnson: (16:43)
Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon. My name is Dr. Amy Johnson, and I’m from Bedford, Virginia. Telehealth deregulation has been of substantial benefit to my colleagues and I over recent months during the COVID-19 crisis. Prior to COVID restrictions, our small local hospital that had limited access to specialty services, used telehealth for neurological, mental health, and palliative care consults. However, telehealth was not something that was used within our primary care setting. Since the deregulation of telehealth restrictions, and expansion of guidelines through CMS, we’ve had the opportunity to integrate video and audio visits as part of our patient care experience.
Dr. Amy Johnson: (17:28)
During the COVID crisis, there were days when almost all of my visits were done via telehealth. This allowed me to continue to care for my patients, including those that were the most vulnerable without risking exposure to illness by bringing them into the office setting. Since we’ve gone back to a more traditional model, we’ve continued to offer telehealth visits, which are a valuable option for home, health, and hospice patients, patients with limited mobility, and patients that remain at high risk. As a farm safety specialist, I can see the use of telehealth expanding to offer more services to our farming population and rural Americans including much needed mental health services, which are unfortunately very sparse.
Dr. Amy Johnson: (18:12)
In addition, access to primary care, and to specialty services can be improved in medically underserved areas with deregulation, and the use of telehealth services by healthcare providers increasing the use of preventative healthcare modalities, allowing for more intensive management of patients with chronic diseases, and decreasing healthcare disparities. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (18:38)
Thank you very much, great job, thank you. So, that’s been a great help to you, telehealth, it’s been an incredible thing. Great job. Thank you very much. Jim Shelton is a rancher from Arizona who was crushed by the Obama, Biden administration’s ridiculous Waters of the United States rule. It’s been a catastrophic rule, but it’s gone now, which gave bureaucrats power to regulate every puddle on private land or a lake. Jim, please come up, and tell us of your experience, which I know wasn’t a good one, but it’s a good one now, please.
Jim Shelton: (19:20)
I appreciate the invitation President Trump to be here, and I appreciate the opportunity to thank you for the deregulation in every area, including the Waters of the United States, cutting the red tape, setting us free as private property owners. Thank you. Our ranch has approximately a hundred dry washes flowing across it. These are little washes with no water. The Corps of Engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency who wrote the Obama 2015 regulations ruled that any dry wash that had more than 12 inches of sand in the bottom became a water of the United States. Hence, we were subject to regulations and oversight from Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. It as outrageous.
Jim Shelton: (20:46)
I believe that the 2015 rules and regulations were overreaching, caused red tape, and threatened me, and other farmers, ranchers, businessmen, and land owners with the possibility of going to jail, and facing huge fines. Thank you Mr. President for the navigable water protection rule that you’ve promulgated. It has set us free. That heavy hand of government is no longer on our shoulders. Thank you Mr. President. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (21:31)
Thank you Jim. Thank you very much, thank you Jim.
Donald Trump: (21:39)
That was my honor Jim, and thank you very much. It’s terrible, that you had to suffer for so long, and they took your property away from you, and you want to take care of your property better than any government is going to tell you to take care of your property. You’ll take care of it better, so we don’t have to worry about that. Thank you very much, beautifully said, thank you. I want to just, as president say that I will always fight to defend your rights, and your freedoms. I Will fight very hard for your rights, and your freedoms. The [inaudible 00:22:12] wants to reverse these extraordinary gains and reimpose these disasters regulations. They want to take what we’ve taken off, Jim, and they want to put them back on, and I guess they can do that.
Donald Trump: (22:26)
You’ll fight him for a little while, but eventually, you’ll lose, and they want to bury our economy under suffocating, relentless landslides of Washington red tape, like we had before I got here. We must never return to the days of soul crushing regulation that ravaged our cities, devastated our workers, drained our vitality right out of our people, and thoroughly crippled our nation’s prized competitive edge. It’s what we have. We have great, great people. The greatest people in the world. Our entire economy, and our very way of life are threatened by Biden’s plans to transform our nation, and subjugate our communities through the blunt force instrument of federal regulation at a level that you haven’t even seen yet.
Donald Trump: (23:17)
Do you think that was bad? You haven’t even seen it yet. They want to go many times what they put you under in the past. Under the Unity platform, Joe Biden published with socialist Bernie Sanders, they are proposing, and this is all in writing. It’s done. They agreed. They are proposing to reenter the job killing unfair Paris Climate Accord, which will cost our country trillions of dollars, trillions and trillions of dollars, and put us in a very, very bad competitive position relative to the world. Not surprising to you, China will be greatly advanced under this ridiculous agreement, so will Russia, so will many other countries. They proposed to mandate…
Donald Trump: (24:03)
… other countries. They propose to mandate net zero emissions from all new homes and buildings, skyrocketing the cost of construction and putting the goal of home ownership out of reach for millions. Destroying the look of the home, the beauty of the home, I’m somebody that’s built many homes, many buildings. If you take a look at this, it doesn’t look good. You still have to sell, right? You still have to sell, but they’ve put it out of reach from a cost standpoint, totally out of reach. It’s not practical, it’s not good and it doesn’t work.
Donald Trump: (24:37)
They want to eliminate carbon from the US energy industry, which means abolishing all American oil, clean coal and natural gas. No coal, no gas, no oil, nothing to fire our massive plants. The result of this federally mandated shut down would be the wholesale destruction of the entire energy industry and many other industries, the economic evisceration of entire communities and the unfettered offshoring of millions of our best jobs to foreign countries and foreign polluters. Millions and millions of jobs would go, thousands and thousands of countries would be at a level that you’ve never seen. Companies would be disappearing, left, and right, just like they did with NAFTA, which we terminated for the USMCA, which is another beauty that we’ve done, not for now, but another great beauty.
Donald Trump: (25:40)
But thousands of companies, plants, factories would be closed. Under this dismal future energy would be unaffordable for the vast majority of Americans and the American dream would be sniffed out so quickly and replaced with a socialist disaster. The Democrats in DC have been in one, two at a much higher level abolish our beautiful and successful suburbs by placing far left Washington bureaucrats in charge of local zoning decisions. They’re absolutely determined to eliminate single family zoning, to destroy the value of houses and communities already built, just as they have in Minneapolis and other locations that you read about today. Your home will go down in value and crime rates will rapidly rise.
Donald Trump: (26:33)
Joe Biden and his bosses from the radical left, want to significantly multiply what they’re doing now. And what will be the end result is you will totally destroy the beautiful suburbs. Suburbia will be no longer as we know it. So they want to defund and abolish your police and law enforcement, while at same time destroying our great suburbs. The suburb destruction will end with us. Next week, I will be discussing the AFFH rule, AFFH rule, a disaster. And our plans to protect the suburbs from being obliterated by Washington Democrats, by people on the far left that want to see the suburbs destroyed that don’t care. People have worked all their lives to get into a community and now they’re going to watch it go to hell, not going to happen, not while I’m here.
Donald Trump: (27:44)
The Biden/Bernie plan would also use the weapon of federal regulation to tie the hands of our police departments by abolishing cash bail, think of that. Think of that bail, no problem, they killed somebody let them out. Take a look at what’s happening, crime in New York City up 368% from just a short while ago. They got rid of a lot of police and they’re in the process of doing it, a billion dollars. They probably want to abolish… it’s not even believable. When I first heard about it, when you first heard about it, you didn’t think it was real, you didn’t think it was believable. Just like the Green New Deal, how crazy is that? But they’re actually trying to put it into play, it’ll mean the end of this country.
Donald Trump: (28:34)
So by getting rid of bail, they are incentivizing jail and prison closures. They want to get rid of prisons, they don’t think anybody should go to prison. Setting loose violent criminals, appointing left-wing social justice prosecutors, like you have in Philadelphia, where people creating and doing the most criminal of acts are let go in many cases immediately and making our wonderful cops, our great, great police, cops, subordinate to distant bureaucrats who have never spent a day in their lives fighting crime.
Donald Trump: (29:18)
Unlike the socialists, we believe in the rule of the people, not the rule of the unelected bureaucrats that don’t know what they’re doing. We believe in the dignity of the individual, not the iron grip of the state. Our regulatory reforms are vital, not only to the success of our economy but the strength of our democracy and the survival of Liberty itself. My administration will continue pressing forward until we have made every last vestige of Washington fully, completely, and totally accountable to the citizens of the United States. We are putting our faith in the workers who power our country, the doctors who care for our country, the truckers who sustain our country and the farmers and ranchers who preserve our country in all of its majestic beauty. The American people are the ones who made our nation great and together we will make it greater by far than ever before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much for being with us. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (31:04)
We must have said something right, I guess we said it absolutely right. It’s about our country, it’s about our country. We want to be strong. We want to respect everybody, but we have to have strong law enforcement and that’s taking place in the areas that we’re responsible for. We want others to call us for help, there’s nothing wrong. Let Chicago call, let Seattle call, we where going into Seattle, all set to go and then they did it themselves. They heard we were coming in and the hands went up, they gave up. And it’s so terrible when you see what’s happening. Minneapolis, we said, “Get the Guard in there.” Three nights, “Get the Guard in, get the guard.” We got the Guard in. The National Guard, they’ve done a fantastic job.
Donald Trump: (31:53)
As soon as they showed up, it was like a knife cutting through butter. You saw that, right? After four days of horror, it wasn’t the police’s fault in any of these places, they were told to leave. The police are, generally speaking, they do a great job. They were told to leave, but you so what happened. Minneapolis, grab your gun and run. That’s not what they wanted to do. But the National Guard came in and we did a great job. No problem, after that, did you notice?
Donald Trump: (32:27)
We just passed a Statues and Monument executive order and they were going well, now you see that beautiful… Look at it right there it’s so beautiful, the Washington Monument. If they had their choice they’d take it down, and I guarantee you they’d rename it. They want to rename it, they want George Washington out. They won Thomas Jefferson out. They want Abraham Lincoln out. They want abolitionists out. They don’t know what they want, they just want to destroy our country. We’re not going to let it happen, we’re not letting it happen. So I’d now like to ask Vice President Mike Pence to say a few words. Thank you, Mike. Thank you.
Jim Shelton: (33:19)
Thank you Mr. President. It’s a privilege to be with you today. Thank you for bringing together all these great hardworking Americans, to be able to hear their stories, to be able to reflect on the fact that before the coronavirus hit our country. Thanks to your leadership, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world. In three short years, Mr. President, you kept your promise to the American people. We cut taxes across the board. You fought for free and fair trade. You unleashed American energy and you rolled back regulations to help all Americans. And after 40 years of over regulation, Mr. President, you delivered four years of regulatory freedom.
Jim Shelton: (34:14)
And in our first three years, the results were extraordinary, businesses large and small created 7 million new jobs, wages rose at their fastest pace. In more than 10 years, 2 million Americans were lifted out of poverty, 7 million Americans lifted off of food stamps and the highest median income in the history of our country.
Jim Shelton: (34:34)
And Mr. President, as you just reflected a centerpiece of that was lifting red tape off the American people and American free enterprise. I remember those days in the campaign four years ago when you promised that for every new regulation, we’d eliminate two rules off the federal register. But as you just said, Mr. President, for every new regulation put on the books, you actually repealed nearly eight regulations off of the American people and the American economy. And this president has already signed more bills rolling back federal red tape than any president in American history.
Jim Shelton: (35:15)
They tell us that we’ve saved $220 billion in our economy, and as you said, more than $3,100 for every American household. And beyond all of that, that regulatory form now has America as the largest supplier of oil and natural gas in the world and a net export of energy for the first time in 75 years, that’s what your deregulation agenda delivered.
Jim Shelton: (35:40)
And today, Mr. President, as we continue to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, at your direction we’re ensuring that our States and our hospitals and our extraordinary health care workers have not only the supplies they need, but the freedom and the flexibility to give every American the same level of care that each one of us would want a family member to have. And as we meet this moment…
Jim Shelton: (36:03)
…most would want a family member to have. And as we meet this moment, in this pandemic, we’re also opening up America again. It’s extraordinary to think Mr. President, at the height of this pandemic, our economy had lost 22 million jobs, but because of the strong foundation that you laid of less taxes and less regulation, in two short months, May and June saw record breaking job creation. We’ve already added 7 million jobs back to the American economy, and we’re just getting started.
Jim Shelton: (36:36)
This record job growth, Mr. President is attribute to the resilience of the American people, strength their character. It’s a resilience to your leadership, to the agenda that you advanced in our first three years. But as you said, Mr. President, it’s also a tribute to governors across the country we not only supported your agenda, but also, in more than 30 states, governors actually delivered on that same agenda of less taxes and less regulation. And while I’ve been leading the White House Coronavirus Task Force, it’s also been my honor, Mr. President, to lead the governor’s initiative on regulatory innovation and to work with these extraordinary governors. The truth is, because of your leadership and example of governors across the country have been reducing the burden of regulations at the state level. And that’s what’s contributed to the strong foundation on which we are standing and the American recovery has already begun.
Jim Shelton: (37:28)
Fortunately, as you mentioned, we have two of those great governors with us today. The first is a governor who in his very first year in office, cut or simplified more than 75% of his state’s regulations and cut the administrative code by 20%. Would you all join me in welcoming Idaho’s great governor, Brad Little to tell us Idaho’s story of deregulation.
Governor Brad Little: (37:55)
Thank you, Mr. Vice president. Mr. President, it’s a great honor to be here. As the Vice President alluded to, our route to rebound is dependent upon the red truck, not the blue truck. What we did in Idaho, where we had the third lowest unemployment, the third fastest income growth of any of the states, particularly for those at the lower end of the income was to match up with your regulatory reform and make more opportunities available, whether it be the spouse of a military veteran that came there, that wanted to have their license in their home state transferred, which today I can proudly say takes us one half day to get that done, so that those people can be there. Whether it’s a small business that wants to break through and remove the regulatory friction that existed there before.
Governor Brad Little: (38:50)
But as this economy changed as a result of what’s taken place, you have to free up all Americans to have that freedom to create a new opportunity. One of the things that we did that we heard about from the good doctor was tele-health. Between CMS, the department and what we did in Idaho, we increased tele-health availability in Idaho by 4000%. Idaho is a rural state. Idaho is a state where accessibility and the cost of healthcare is always an issue. It’s the combination and the teamwork of your administration and what we’ve done that made that available to where we will rebound in Idaho. And thank you very much, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (39:32)
Thank you very much, Brad. Thank you. Thank you, Brad.
Jim Shelton: (39:38)
Thank you, Governor Little. And finally, Mr. President allow me to introduce the governor who told us in December, when you kicked off the governor’s initiative on regulatory innovation, that in his first year in office, his administration modified or rolled back 239 different regulations in over 100 professions. He is making sure that Alaska is open for business and prospering with less taxes and less regulation. Join me in welcoming Alaska’s great governor, Mike Dunleavy.
Joe Cambria: (40:15)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President. And thank you Mr. President for having us here today. What you’ve done here for us, for governors and the people of this great country and Alaska, we are part of the great country by the way, Mr. President, you know that.
Donald Trump: (40:28)
You are.
Joe Cambria: (40:29)
The president has been up in our state, we’ve met at least eight times. And when he stops over in Anchorage, Alaska on his trips, he always wants to meet. And the first thing he says is, “Can we meet the troops? And what do you need in the state of Alaska?” This is a small state population-wise, way up North, but this President sees the importance of that state and its people. This is really about hope, Mr. President, restoring hope and opportunity. And this is what you’ve done. This is really about the art of the possibility. As the previous Governor Little said, what you’ve done is historic, and it’s going to continue to be historic.
Joe Cambria: (41:06)
In Alaska, for example, we have communities that are 500, 600 miles off the road system. The tele-health regulations that have been put in place now are not only going to be good for medicine, but they’re going to save lives as a result of the work that you and your team have done. We look at our resource development, we look at businesses, small and big, and you’ve restored. You’ve renewed hope that it is possible to achieve the American dream. These regulations over the past 40 years have really, in many respects, killed the American dream. As you said, strangled the American dream. And in the end, really what this comes down to is how does it impact the individual American, the individual Alaska, in my case.
Joe Cambria: (41:53)
I want to tell you, what you’ve done is, when the landowner goes and decides that they want to do a little landscaping on their property, do they have to look over their shoulder and wonder if big government is watching them? Can they do what they need to do on their private property? You’ve restored the hope that they can, that they can realize the American dream. And this goes for our corporations. This goes for our entities, our nonprofit entities, this goes for our native corporations in Alaska. What you’ve done is restored hope and opportunity. And we’re looking forward to a more years of this opportunity, Mr. President so thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (42:26)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mike. Thank you. We have many exciting things that we’ll be announcing over the next eight weeks I would say. Things that nobody has even contemplated, thought about, thought possible and things that we’re going to get done and we have gotten done. We’ve started in most cases, but it’s going to be a very exciting eight weeks. A eight weeks, I think Mike, we can honestly say nobody’s ever going to see eight weeks like we’re going to have, because we really have. We’re taking on immigration, taking on education, we’re taking on so many aspects of things that people were hopelessly tied up in knots in Congress. They’ve been working on some of these things for 25, 30 years, wasn’t happening.
Donald Trump: (43:24)
But you’ll see levels of detail and you’ll see levels of thought that a lot of people believed very strongly we didn’t have in this country. We’re going to get things done. We’re going to get things done that they’ve wanted to see done for a long, long time. I think we’ll start sometime on Tuesday. We’ll be discussing our one plan on suburbia, but that’s one of many, many different plans. Then we’re going into the immigration, the world of immigration. The world of education. We’re going into the world of healthcare, very complete healthcare. And we have a lot of very exciting things to discuss, but cutting of regulation has been really something that I felt we could do and we could do fairly easily. Nothing’s easy in this country.
Donald Trump: (44:18)
We had statutory requirements where we’d do phase one and then we’d have to wait 90 days, we’d do phase two and we’d have to wait 60 days. We do phase three and we said, let’s do phase four, “Sir, I’m sorry, you have to wait one year.” But we were able to do things that nobody has ever been able to do or even close on deregulation. And these trucks, this really is a great, a great little example. I don’t know who thought of this idea, but it’s actually quite simple and quite good. Is that Brooke? Quite simple and quite good. I don’t love having that big sucker hanging over my head. I want to get out of here as fast as possible, but I do want to thank you all incredible people. You’ve done an incredible job. And to the speakers, please. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Brad."

Well thank you very much please. Great honor to be with you in the beautiful Rose Garden on a sweltering day but I do want to thank you all for being here as we proudly launch the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative. Very exciting. Very exciting.
Crowd: (00:47)
Four more years. Four more years.
Donald Trump: (00:47)
Thank you. With this very exciting new effort, we will deliver a future of greater promise, opportunity and freedom for our nation’s really it’s a treasure. You are a treasure. The Hispanic-Americans and the Hispanic-American community is a treasure. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:06)
We’re thrilled to be joined today by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. Thank you Betsy, thank you. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, thank you Wilbur. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, thank you Ben. Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza. Thank you. Jovita. Very popular, Jovita, and Representative Mike Garcia. Good, thank you. Thank you. Congratulations Mike. That was a big win. Biggest in 22 years they say. First time in 22 years.
Donald Trump: (01:46)
That’s a good one. Well you got something special going, right? Thank you Mike. Great job. Yesterday I was delighted to host my friend President Lopez Obrador of Mexico here in the White House in a firm but close and continued friendship between the United States and Mexico. It’s never been better. The executive order that I will sign in a few moments will expand our efforts across all the federal government to deliver educational and economic opportunity for Hispanic-Americans.
Donald Trump: (02:20)
At the heart of our strategy to create a prosperous future for every Hispanic-American as well as all Americans is a great family of education. We are going to have a tremendous program and we have and you know we’re a believer in choice, choice. The other folks don’t believe in choice and choice is a great civil rights issue and maybe the great one of our times.
Donald Trump: (02:46)
I’m going to fight to ensure that every Hispanic-American parent has the freedom and the right to send your child to the public, private, charter, faith-based, magnet, home, or independent school of your choice and school choice is an incredible issue in many ways. It’s a political issue, I agree. Most people agree with us. The smart ones definitely agree with us but it’s also a moral issue and it really is a fundamental issue of civil rights. No American student should ever be trapped in a failing government school which has happened so often for so many years. It’s one of the problems you see when you see these cities going up in flame.
Donald Trump: (03:33)
One of the most successful educational models is the charter school which has been under unceasing attack from the radical left. Charter schools, charter schools have been incredible, but they’re under attack and you know why they’re under attack. More than one million Hispanic-American children currently attend charter schools and nearly one in three charter school students is Hispanic-American. I’m proud that under my administration, we’ve delivered over $1.5 billion for public charter schools. That’s a record.
Donald Trump: (04:12)
As long as I’m president I will never let your charter schools be taken away from you, be taken down. I will never let you down. I will never let Hispanic-American or any American down. That I can tell you.
Donald Trump: (04:27)
Under our leadership, the Hispanic-American high school graduation rate has reached an all-time high in the history of our country and the dropout rate has reached an all-time low in the history of our country. We have also delivered a $1 billion grant for minority-serving institutions including Hispanic-serving institutions of higher learning. Our new Hispanic Prosperity Initiative will also expand access to trade school, something that’s been really badly missing, trade schools. So important. Work-based learning and vocational education, so important. Vocational. When I was young, growing up, I used to see vocational school, Edison Vocational School. That meant people with a great talent but a talent different than history and math and other things but they had the same talent or far greater than many of the A students that studied other things. Vocational school. Great people, great talent, and they do very well, they do very well.
Donald Trump: (05:37)
Through our pledge to the American worker, we have already made available 16 million apprenticeships and training opportunities to the jobs of tomorrow. To bring jobs and prosperity to our most distressed communities, we created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones. That’s been a great success, a tremendous. Tim Scott of South Carolina has helped us so much. Which have already brought nearly $100 billion in investment to neighborhoods where millions of Hispanic-Americans live and you see it, so many of you already today, in speaking with you, you said what a difference that made. Before the plague from China came in, you know what that is, it’s the China virus. Before it came in and hit us, we achieved the lowest Hispanic-American unemployment rate and the lowest poverty rate ever recorded. History of our country ever recorded and we’re getting back to it very quickly. We achieved the highest ever incomes for Hispanic-Americans and many other American groups and communities. We built the greatest economy in history, not only for our country but for the world. We were number one by far. China had the worst year in 67 years. They weren’t happy with what was going. They were going in the wrong direction, and then the plague came in.
Donald Trump: (07:00)
Together, we will do it again and we will do it very quickly and we’re already doing it. We will achieve a swift, full and complete recovery for Hispanic-Americans and the Hispanic-American community and we’re doing it very, very rapidly. Our strategy focuses on sheltering the most vulnerable, including older Americans and nursing home residents while allowing those at lower risk such as young and healthy children in many cases, the immune system is so powerful, so strong, but the young and the healthy to safely return to work and to school. We have to open our schools. Open our schools. Stop this nonsense. We open our schools. Germany, Norway, so many countries right now. They’re opened, the schools are open and they’re doing just fine and they’re opening in the fall. So we have to get our schools open. Denmark, Sweden. We have to get our schools open and stop this political nonsense and it’s only political nonsense. It’s politics. They don’t want to open because they think it will help them on November 3. I think it’s going to hurt them on November 3. Open your schools.
Donald Trump: (08:20)
At the same time, we’re unleashing the scientific brilliance of our people. We have multiple effective therapies in use already with more being developed and you have to see some of them. The results are looking incredible and we were on track to produce a vaccine in record time and very, very soon. It’s going to be announced I believe very, very soon. So we have therapies and we have vaccines. Utilizing these advances an the skill of our doctors and nurses, we have dramatically reduced mortality rates. We have among the lowest mortality rate anywhere in the world. Done a great job, whether it’s ventilators or anything you want to look at, testing. We test so many people that we have more cases. Everybody says we have so many cases. That’s because we test so many people. We’re up to approximately 40 million tests going up to 45 very quickly. So we have tests, other countries don’t do tests like we do, so we show cases. Other countries don’t show cases, but what we do have is we have perhaps the lowest but among the lowest but perhaps the lowest mortality rate, death rate anywhere in the world. That’s a tremendous sign as to what we’re doing and what our doctors have learned and the kinds of things that we’re using. It’s an incredible number, statistically an incredible number.
Donald Trump: (09:42)
A policy of never-ending lockdowns, month after month would ultimately do more harm than good to public health and so bad for our children. As a result, it really is more loss of life. We can’t do that. We have to get back now. We did it right. We saved millions of lives by what we did. We shut it down, we saved millions of lives. I put a ban on China. Heavily infected. I put a ban on Europe very early, both of them very early. We saved millions of lives, now it’s time to get back to work. A lot of people were against those bans and now they admit, most of those same people admit that ban was the greatest thing. It saved so many lives.
Donald Trump: (10:27)
Crucially we realized that the health of a nation’s economy is fundamental to the health of its people. In the last two months we have begun the fastest economic comeback in history, including an increase in Hispanic-American employment, of more than 2.1 million jobs. That’s a record. The Hispanic Prosperity Initiative will help build on this program. I will be naming a leader of incredible vision, former Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico, John Sanchez and I know he’s here. John, I’d love to have you come up and say a few words please. Thank you very much.
John Sanchez: (11:09)
Well thank you Mr. President. What an honor it is to be here with you and everybody else here in our nation’s capital. Let me say from a young boy who grew up in absolute poverty, the youngest of eight kids with a single mother, I understand what it is for the challenges facing all families but especially Hispanic families in this country, but because of her leadership through personal responsibility, stay in school, get a good education, we have lived the American dream. As a young boy I used to go and search for cardboard boxes out of the trash cans of grocery stores because we didn’t have the soles, Mr. President, on our shoes. We would hope and pray that it wouldn’t rain so the cardboard wouldn’t melt on our way to school. Here now almost 50 years later I stand next to the most powerful man in the world and the most powerful city in the world at the White House with all of you fine folks. Today, I have lived the American dream. I look at my brand new black shoes. That’s the American dream.
Donald Trump: (12:05)
Nice shoes.
John Sanchez: (12:05)
Mr. President, your leadership when it comes to job creation, education reform, choice when it comes to education, will allow this country to fulfill its American dream. I’m honored to be here with you Mr. President. Your great leadership making America great. We stand with you, we’ll keep America great under your leadership. God bless you. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (12:24)
Thank you John. Great job John. Thank you very much. Great honor. I will also be appointing the CEO and president of Goya Foods, Bob Unanue, please. Please, Bob. Thank you very much Bob.
Bob Unanue: (12:43)
Good afternoon Mr. President. Good afternoon everyone. It’s such an honor and such a blessing to be here in the greatest country in the world, the most prosperous country in the world, and we continue to grow and that’s what we’re here to do today. Our company was founded in 1936 by my grandfather, who left Spain at only 18 years old, did not know where he was heading, but he was heading and looking for opportunity and prosperity and he found it in this great country.
Bob Unanue: (13:19)
Today our company is a multi-billion dollar company, with thousands of employees and with facilities all around the globe. We have a tremendous group of what we call la gran familia Goya, the great Goya family, and these are people, I told the president earlier, we haven’t gone back to work, we never stopped working because when I asked our group, our family, “This is going to be a tough thing.” They said, “Look Bob, if we don’t do it, nobody will,” and they stood up and they worked and we continue to work, day and night, to provide much-needed food and nutrition to this country.
Bob Unanue: (14:07)
Today, it gives me great honor and by the way, we’re all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump who is a builder and that’s what my grandfather did. He came to this country to build, to grow, to prosper and so we have an incredible builder and we pray, we pray for our leadership, our president, and we pray for our country, that we will continue to prosper and to grow.
Bob Unanue: (14:40)
Today, I have an announcement to make that the grand familia Goya wanted to share with all of you. There’s a great need today in food banks around the country. Food is being depleted. Hopefully as the summer ends we have new crops coming forward but right now there is a shortage. So our employees and some partners we have in the industry wanted to donate one million cans of Goya chickpeas and a million pounds of food. These are all products made in the United States, steel, from United States steel, sealed in containers, [inaudible 00:15:22] in Arkansas donating food, our farmers and again all of our products, a lot of our products are grown here in the United States made in America, and we’re very proud to give back to this nation to the food banks which we’re going to be needing some of that important food. Something that we do all year but in particular at this special time, we wanted to make that gift. So God bless you all, we hope that we continue to prosper and grow in this great country and give thanks to God. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (15:58)
Thank you Bob. Thank you. Thank you Bob. That’s very nice. We’re also grateful to be joined by future commission members standing behind me, Mario Rodriguez, Steve Cortes, Lourdes Aguirre, Jose Fuentes, Cassandra Garcia, [inaudible 00:16:22] Chris Garcia, Jesus Marquez, David [Olivencia 00:16:29], Alfredo Ortiz. Thank you all very much for being here. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (16:36)
Great. Great group of people. We just had a fantastic meeting. Hispanic-Americans are cherished members of our national family. They have been an integral part of building this country throughout all of American history. Over generations, Hispanic-Americans have started countless small businesses, inspired our communities and served our country in every way imaginable. As police officers, service members, motor patrol agents, pastors, teachers and business leaders, they’re incredible.
Donald Trump: (17:08)
Now Hispanic-Americans are watching as the cities they helped build, the communities they help police, the businesses they created, and the dreams they pursued are being threatened by an extreme movement that wants to tear everything down. At the center of this movement is an aggressive effort to defund the police, if you can even believe that. Defund the police, think about that. It’s a sad, sad thing. These people are crazy. They are crazy. Which would inflict great harm on our hardworking Latino communities. Great great harm. Many immigrants came to the United States in order to leave countries where the rule of law had been eroded and they don’t want those same conditions to be replicated here. They don’t want them back. They know what it is firsthand. They know what happens when the police cannot protect the innocent. When the rule of law is destroyed, when justice becomes an instrument of vengeance. Hispanic-Americans, they know. They’re hardworking patriots who support our police, protect our communities and believe strongly in the rule of law. I will stand arm and arm with the Hispanic community to ensure that every child in America can grow up in safety, security, dignity and in peace.
Donald Trump: (18:36)
We believe that the timeless principles of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution are all shared and they have to be shared in a big, beautiful heritage of all Americans. Whether you’re a first generation American or a fifth generation American, this is your home. American history is your history. It’s about you, it’s about your family, it’s about our country and the American dream belongs equally to you. American heroes inspire us all and their legacy falls to all of us to cherish and to protect and to revere. Every American, no matter your background, is entitled to a government that puts your needs and your families first. Americans of all walks of life are united by the same noble ideas and the same fundamental designs for good schools, strong families, safe communities, and abundant opportunity and I will not rest until we have delivered this future for every community, not only the Hispanic community which is doing so well, but every community in our land. Together we will write the next great chapter of the American adventure and we will defend the greatness of America for your children, for your children’s children, and for generations to come.
Donald Trump: (20:05)
Before signing this executive order which is such an important executive order, I’d like to invite Secretary DeVos to come up and say a few words followed by Administrator Carranza. Please come up, Betsy. Thank you.
Betsy DeVos: (20:26)
Thank you so much Mr. President for your leadership on this initiative. As you have noted education opens the door to prosperity and opportunity and Hispanic students like all students need to have the freedom and choice to find their education fit. Mr. President, you have led in advancing opportunity for Hispanic students by supporting Hispanics serving higher ed institutions by expanding the opportunities for charter schools by expanding the D.C. opportunity scholarship program right here in the district and there’s still more to do. Because all Hispanic students across our country need to have the opportunity to choose their right education fit. They need to have school choice. We know this is broadly supported by Hispanic families. 80% of them support this notion of insuring their children and their grandchildren have that opportunity. So thank you Mr. President for your leadership in ensuring that all Hispanic students hae that chance at the American dream.
Donald Trump: (21:31)
Thank you.
Betsy DeVos: (21:31)
Thanks Mr. President.
Jovita Carranza: (21:45)
I can’t believe I blinked at you, President. Thank you Mr. President. It’s a tremendous honor to be part of an administration so dedicated to helping Latino entrepreneurs during this extraordinary time in our country. As the daughter of first generation Mexican-Americans, I know firsthand how important opportunity is toward promoting upward mobility and enabling the American dream. Creating opportunities is the central goal behind the president’s new executive order, establishing the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative, designed to help Hispanic Americans reach their dreams through innovative education and career pathways. Under your leadership, Mr. President, Latinos have been the fastest growing group of entrepreneurs in the country and we want to see that continue. [Spanish 00:22:40].
Donald Trump: (23:53)
Hey Mike, maybe you’d come up just and say a real quick word because it’s about setting records out here but come on out. This man is such a big star now. California, you won in California. You got to be good, a Republican. Going to have a lot of Republicans winning in California, Mike I think, please.
Mike Garcia: (24:21)
I hope so. I think it’s the beginning of something great in California personally Mr. President. Thank you for the honor of being here today. It’s a huge honor to be here with my Hispanic brothers and sisters, leaders in your communities, leaders in your respective businesses. I am the American dream. I am a first generation American. My dad immigrated here from Mexico when he was nine years old. I had the opportunity to serve my country in the U.S. Navy, flying the most powerful strike fighter jets in the world, the F-18 [inaudible 00:24:51] aircraft carriers and combat operations, and now I’m sitting here as a member of Congress on the lawn of the White House.
Mike Garcia: (25:01)
I’d like to just echo the president’s comments that now is the time where we need to unite as an Americans and really realize what this fight is all about. It’s about freedom, it’s about liberties, it’s about fighting like it’s 1776 all over again. That’s how real this fight is. So I’m proud to be here. I’m proud to be serving my country again at this most critical time in our nation’s history, and Mr. President, thank you for your leadership. Brothers and sisters, thank you for being here today.
Donald Trump: (25:27)
Thank you very much.
Mike Garcia: (25:27)
Huge honor. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (25:32)
Ben Carson, please come up just for a minute. Say a few words. Ben, you’ve done such a great job. Thank you very much.
Ben Carson: (25:42)
Thank you Mr. President and thank you all for being here today. You know it’s so important, the emphasis that you have placed on opportunity and you ask the White House Council on Opportunity & Revitalization to look at those communities that were particularly affected in the COVID-19 and we look to that and not just the fact that there was more hypertension and diabetes, obesity, asthma, but to look another layer underneath that and to deal with that and that’s what we’re doing under your leadership.
Ben Carson: (26:24)
Every single person in our society is worth saving. We only have 330 million people. Sounds like a lot but it’s a quarter of what China has, a quarter of what India has and we’re going to have to compete with them in the future so we need to develop all of our people and your emphasis on education and educational choice will be the thing that really distinguishes and liberates our people so thank you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (26:56)
So now I’m going to go and sign a very important document, one that we’ve been working on for a long time and I just want to congratulate the Hispanic-American community. Incredible people, thank you very much and God bless you all, God bless America. Thank you very much.
Speaker 10: (27:09)
Mr. President, will you take some questions from us?"
"Jul 4, 2020",4:07 P.M. CDT,"Donald Trump: (00:24)
Wow. You having a good time? Members of Congress, members of my cabinet, and my fellow Americans, the First Lady and I are delighted to welcome you to the second annual Salute to America. On this wonderful day, we celebrate our history, our heroes, our heritage, our great American flag, and our freedom. Happy 4th of July to everyone.
Donald Trump: (01:09)
I want to thank the US Army Golden Knights for that truly awe-inspiring display, tremendous talent. The Golden Knights and every member of the Armed Forces here this evening, we just want to say that you have earned the eternal gratitude of our entire nation. 244 years ago in Philadelphia, the 56 signers of our Declaration of Independence pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to boldly proclaim this eternal truth that we are all made equal by God.
Donald Trump: (01:57)
Thanks to the courage of those patriots on July 4th, 1776, the American Republic stands today as the greatest, most exceptional, and most virtuous nation in the history of the world. Our workers, our factories have revolutionized industries and lifted millions into prosperity. Our artists, architects, and engineers have inspired the globe with transcendent works of beauty. American heroes defeated the Nazis, dethroned the fascists, toppled the communists, saved American values, upheld American principles, and chased down the terrorists to the very ends of the earth.
Donald Trump: (02:58)
We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who, in many instances, have absolutely no clue what they are doing.
Donald Trump: (03:21)
Our inventors, scientists, doctors, and researchers have improved the lives of billions and billions of people all around the world. Our brave astronauts planted the American flag on the moon, and America will be the first nation to land on Mars.
Donald Trump: (03:48)
All Americans living today are the heirs of this magnificent legacy. We are the descendants of the most daring and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the Earth. We inherit their towering confidence, unwavering enthusiasm, their unbridled ambition, and their unrelenting optimism. This is the untamed spirit that built this glorious nation, and this is the spirit that burns brightly within the soul of every American patriot.
Donald Trump: (04:34)
That is why we pay tribute to generations of American heroes whose names have etched on our monuments and memorials and in the pages of history and in the hearts of a very grateful people. We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children, or trample on our freedoms. We will safeguard our values, traditions, customs, and beliefs. We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so that they can build its future. Together we will fight for the American dream, and we will defend, protect, and preserve American way of life, which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America.
Donald Trump: (05:46)
Jobs and companies are coming back to our country like never before. The power of tariffs being imposed on foreign lands that took advantage of the United States for decades and decades have enabled us to make great trade deals where there were none. Tens of billions of dollars are now paid to the United States Treasury by these same countries.
Donald Trump: (06:17)
But there and then, we got hit by the virus that came from China. We’ve made a lot of progress. Our strategy is moving along well. It goes out in one area and rears back its ugly face in another area. But we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned how to put out the flame. We’ve made ventilators where there were none by the tens of thousands, to the point that we have far more than we need, and we are now distributing them to many foreign countries as a gesture of good will. Likewise, testing. There were no test for a new virus, but now we have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless, results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have, not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality. Now, just like everything else, we have become the manufacturer on record for ventilators. We have the most and finest testing anywhere in the world, and we are producing gowns and masks and surgical equipment in our country; where heretofore, it was almost exclusively made in foreign lands and-
Donald Trump: (08:03)
It was almost exclusively made in foreign lands, in particular, China where, ironically, this virus and others came from. China’s secrecy, deceptions, and cover-up allowed it to spread all over the world, 189 countries, and China must be held fully accountable. With respect to remedies, we are now doing unbelievably well and are in deep testing on vaccines, treatments, and therapeutics.
Donald Trump: (08:46)
I want to send our thanks to the scientists and researchers around the country and even around the world who are at the forefront of our historic effort to rapidly develop and deliver lifesaving treatments and ultimately, a vaccine. We are unleashing our nation’s scientific brilliance and will likely have a therapeutic and/or vaccine solution long before the end of the year. We’re very grateful to be joined this evening by Americans battling on the front lines to kill the virus. I just want to say that America thanks you. Please, stand. Please. Thank you very much. Great, brilliant people. These are great and brilliant people. Thank you. And brave people.
Donald Trump: (09:54)
Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential. Never forget, we are one family and one nation. This rich heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old, first generation American. We want to go from first generation to 10th generation. It matters not. We are American. We are from the USA. This great heritage belongs to citizens of every background and of every walk of life. No matter our race, color, religion, or creed, we are one America, and we put America first.
Donald Trump: (10:53)
We will not allow anyone to divide our citizens by race or background. We will not allow them to foment hate, discord, and distrust. We will hold fast and true to the sacred loyalties that link us all as neighbors, as Americans, and as patriots. In every age, there have always been those who seek to lie about the past in order to gain power in the present. Those that are lying about our history, those who want us to be ashamed of who we are are not interested in justice or in healing. Their goal is demolition. Our goal is not to destroy the greatest structure on earth, what we have built, the United States of America, to build a future where every family is safe, where every child is surrounded by love, where every community has equal opportunity and every citizen enjoys great and everlasting dignity.
Donald Trump: (12:13)
Our past is not a burden to be cast away. It is not a miraculous foundation that will lift us to the next great summit of human endeavor. This incredible story of American progress is the story of each generation, picking up where the last finished, linked by time, by fate and the eternal bonds of our national affection. Those who would sever those bonds would cut us off from the wisdom, the courage, the love, and the devotion that gave us everything we are today and everything we strive for tomorrow. We cannot let that happen. We will not throw away our heroes. We will honor them, and we will prove worthy of their sacrifice. These are great heroes.
Donald Trump: (13:24)
Let me also say a word to those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity. That’s what our people are doing. We want a clear and faithful defense of American history, and we want unity. When you level these false charges, you not only slander me, you not only slander the American people, but you slander generations of heroes who gave their lives for America. You slander people much braver and more principle than you. You’re slandering the young men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima and those who perished fighting for freedom in the Civil War. You slander them. You are dishonoring their great legacy and their memory by insisting that they fought for racism and they fought for oppression.
Donald Trump: (14:54)
They didn’t fight for those things. They fought for the exact opposite. We will not let the legacy of these heroes be tarnished by you. The more you lie, the more you slander, the more you try to demean and divide, the more we will work hard to tell the truth, and we will win. The more you lie and demean and collude, the more credibility you lose. We want to bring the country together, and a free and open media will make this task a very easy one. Our country will be united after all. What do we all want? We want a strong military, great education, housing.
Donald Trump: (16:03)
Low taxes.
Crowd: (16:03)
Yes!
Donald Trump: (16:03)
Law and order?
Crowd: (16:03)
Yeah!
Donald Trump: (16:03)
We want safety.
Crowd: (16:04)
Yeah!
Donald Trump: (16:06)
We want equal justice.
Donald Trump: (16:09)
We want religious liberty.
Crowd: (16:11)
Yeah!
Donald Trump: (16:12)
We want faith, and family, and living in great communities, and happy communities and safe communities, and we want great jobs, and we want to be respected by the rest of the world, not taken advantage of by the rest of the world, which has gone on for decade after decade.
Crowd: (16:30)
Yes!
Donald Trump: (16:31)
We should all want the same thing. How can it be any different than those things? The more bitter you become, the more we will appeal to love and patriotism, and the more we will rise above your hate to build a better future for every child in our great country.
Donald Trump: (16:51)
To celebrate America’s majestic inheritance, yesterday I signed an executive order to create a brand new monument to our most beloved icons, the national Garden of American Heroes will be a vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of the greatest Americans who have ever lived. We will honor extraordinary citizens from every community, and from every place and from every part of our nation. Great men and great women, people that we can look up to forever. Families will be able to walk among the statues of titans, and we have already selected the first 30 legacies and 30 legends, and why don’t we start with a man who’s been very unfairly treated, who twos years ago, three years ago, especially five or six years ago people would have said “It’s impossible to even attempt to try and disturb his incredible legacy and success?”
Donald Trump: (18:18)
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Betsy Ross, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, James Madison, Dolley Madison, the great Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln, Harriet Tubman, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Clara Barton, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Henry Clay, Susan B. Anthony, Booker T Washington, Orville and Wilbur Wright, who are looking down, and you’re going to see some planes like you have never seen before, because we build them better than anybody in the world. The greatest air force, the greatest fighters, the greatest everything. You’re going to be seeing something. I just wonder what Orville and Wilbur would have been thinking if they ever got to see that, but they’re looking, they’re checking it out right now along with us. Amelia Earhart. A great, great athlete, no matter where he went he was the best athlete, Jackie Robinson. George S. Patton. General Patton, he didn’t know how to lose. He didn’t know how to lose. General Douglas MacArthur, Audie Murphy, the great Billy Graham. An incredible man, respected by everybody, Martin Luther King. President Ronald Reagan, Christa McAuliffe, and Antonin Scalia.
Donald Trump: (20:47)
So those are just a few of the people we’ll be naming, and things are subject to change, but once we make that decision, those great names are going to be up there and they’re never coming down. They have just been an incredible group, and we are going to do this in a very democratic way, frankly. We’re going to take names and suggestions, we’re going to have committees, and we’re going to pick the greatest people that this country has ever known, the most respected people, the people that helped us the most and the people that we can look up to and that our children and grandchildren and great grandchildren can look up to into the future and they can say “Isn’t America just a tremendous place?” So, thank you. That’ll be very exciting.
Donald Trump: (21:42)
The Patriots who built our country were not villains, they were heroes whose courageous deeds improved the earth beyond measure. The beauty and the glory of our constitutional system is that it gives us the tools to fight injustice, to heal division and to continue the work of our founding fathers by expanding and growing the blessings of America. If you believe in justice, if you believe in freedom, if you believe in peace, then you must cherish the principles of our founding and the text of our constitution. It’s our founding and our constitution. It is a firm foundation upon which all progress is achieved. That’s why our country is so strong, even despite terrible things that happen over the generations.
Donald Trump: (22:41)
Here this evening are a number of heroes who risked their own lives to uphold these values and to keep our communities and our country safe. We are joined by the outstanding law enforcement officers who have been able to fight on the front lines protecting our cities, many of them facing down violent assaults from very bad people. We are especially moved to be joined by the family of a great man, fallen officer David Dorn, a 38 year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department who was killed last month in the city he devoted his life to defending. And to David’s great family, I want to thank you very much. The American people will always support the courageous men and women of law enforcement, and nobody, nobody embodies that better than David. Thank you very much. Please.
Donald Trump: (24:00)
Please. And David is looking down right now, and he is so proud of you, and he loves you so much, and thank you for being here. He’s a great man. He’s a great man.
Donald Trump: (24:43)
Finally, tonight, we will salute the greatness and loyalty and valor of the men and women who have defended our independence for 244 years. We will honor the amazing men and women of the United States military. Never in history has a nation used so much power to advance so much good. Battlefields across the world and here at home are marked with the gravestones of young patriots who spent their final valiant moments on this earth to secure liberty and peace. Every child should be taught the military heroes who fought and died to make us free. These are great, great people. These are great, great heroes, indeed.
Donald Trump: (25:39)
And our greatest leaders and heroes should be recognized and even immortalized for coming generations to see. You know that. This will make our country even stronger, long into the future. In a few moments, we will bear witness to awesome aircraft representing every major military conflict over the last 75 years. These planes once launched off massive aircraft carriers in the fiercest battles of World War II. They raced through the skies of Korea’s MiG alley. They carried American warriors into the dense fields and jungles of Vietnam. They delivered a swift and swip…you know that, sweeping … It was swift and it was sweeping like nobody’s ever seen anything happen. A victory in Operation Desert Storm. A lot of you were involved in that. A lot of you were involved. That was a quick one. And they’ve gone on to dangerous missions all around the world to take out enemy terrorists and bring our soldiers home safely.
Donald Trump: (27:02)
As you know, we’ve killed, this last year, the two leading terrorists of the last 10 years, al-Baghdadi and Soleimani. Killed, gone, over. We’ve worked to fully rebuild the armed forces of the United States. No enemy on earth stands a chance. $2.5 trillion we’ve invested, all made in the USA. We’ve never had anything near the power and the equipment that we have right now. We did that over the last three years. Everywhere these aircraft have flown, they’ve rained down American thunder, delivered American justice, and they have fiercely defended every square inch of American sovereignty. In their steel frames, broad wings, and roaring engines, we see the story of America’s daring defiance, its soaring spirit, and undying resolve. Throughout our history, our country has been tested and tried, but we have always fought to victory. Whenever our way of life has been threatened, our ancestors have responded with the same resounding answer as those first patriots who fought for independence.
Donald Trump: (28:25)
We are Americans, and we never back down. We never give in, and we never give up, and we will never yield defense of our nation. We love our nation. We will only fight to win.
Donald Trump: (28:40)
Today, we thank God for the gift of life and for the blessing of liberty. We honor the legends of our history, the glories of our founding fathers, and the giants of the past, and the heroes of today who keep us safe, who keep us strong and proud, and who keep us free. Once again, happy July 4th to all. Our country is in great shape. Our military has never been stronger, and many, many good things are going to happen. Next year will be one of the greatest years we’ve ever had. I want to thank our men and women, they are so good, of the National Park Service, air traffic control, and the United States military. God bless you. God bless our heroes. God bless America.
Donald Trump: (29:37)
And now, let the flyovers begin. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Jun 25, 2020",2:21 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you, Lee Greenwood. Thank you very much. Hey, it’s a good song, isn’t it? Lee Greenwood. And thank you very much. I’m thrilled to be here with you on this incredible summer day in Wisconsin on the edge of the beautiful Lake Michigan. That is beautiful too. I know it well with the legendary workers of Marinette Marine, and you now have a lot of contracts because of the United States government. You’re going to be so busy. You’re going to be so busy. I know you went through a little bit of a hard time, not anymore, not anymore. Got you covered for years.
Donald Trump: (01:13)
For more than 75 years, the workers of this shipyard have built some 1,500 of the finest and most fearsome vessels ever to sail. You’ve kept our sailors safe and our Navy strong. Every single day, you prove that American workers are the best in the world, and now you’re going to do things like you’ve never done before. Moments ago, I walked the length of the Majestic Freedom class combat ship that many of you have been pouring your hearts and souls out for over a year. Soon, that ship will be commissioned into the most powerful fleet in human history.
Donald Trump: (01:50)
We’re building up the Navy. We’ll have 350 ships. It was actually down to a level which was World War I. That’s a long time ago, isn’t it, World War I. We’re building it up very rapidly. It’s the United States Navy. It will be bigger and stronger than it ever was before. Everywhere it goes, our allies and enemies alike will know the strength and pride that symbolizes that name, USS, and there it is. Marinette, proud of it. It’s great.
Donald Trump: (02:25)
I want to thank the leadership team of Fincantieri Marinette Marine for welcoming us to this incredible place. It’s truly an incredible place, and now the world is watching because you’re here, not because I’m here, because you’re here. But the world is watching you, including I want to thank Jan Almond, Dario [Desde 00:02:46], and Vice-admiral Rick Hunt. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Thanks also to Lockheed Martin executive Vice-president Stephanie Hill. Thank you, Stephanie. Great job. We’re pleased to be joined as well by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross, a legend on Wall Street, and he’s putting his magic to work. Our economy is coming back at a level that nobody ever imagined possible. We’re doing great. We’re doing good. And remember, as I say all the time because we want to say this in front of the media. There they are. Look at all those people, the fake news. We have the greatest testing program in the world. We’ve developed it over a period of time, and we’re up to almost 30 million tests. That means we’re going to have more cases. If we didn’t want to test or if we didn’t test, we wouldn’t have cases. But we have cases because we test. Deaths are down. We have one of the lowest mortality rates. We’ve done an incredible historic job, and I want the people working on it and not me, but I want all of those people on the task force that have done such a great job on the testing, on the ventilators. We’re now making thousands of ventilators a week. When we started, we weren’t making ventilators. We didn’t have them, and other people didn’t have it. We had very few. Now we’re helping other countries with the ventilator problem, a little bit like ships. They’re complicated to make. They’re big, they’re expensive, and we’re making now thousands a week, and we’re helping many other countries. They call, and they need help because this horrible virus has hit 188 countries, if you can believe it. It came from China, and it hit 188 countries. Not good, not good.
Donald Trump: (04:40)
I want to thank Wisconsin state representatives John Nygren and Mary Felzkowski. Mary, thank you very much. John, thank you very much. Thank you both. And Marinette mayor, Steve Genisot, thank you, Steve, wherever you may be. Thank you very much. Thank you. We’re here today to celebrate the resounding victory for all of you, for Wisconsin, for the United States military and for an entire nation. Our nation is very proud of Wisconsin. Not long ago, the future of this historic shipyard was looking… Can I use the word bleak? Yes, I think we can. It was looking bleak. You were down to 44 people that was getting ready to close up. Then a lot of good things came along.
Donald Trump: (05:25)
Despite your extraordinary service to our country over the generations, this beloved facility, the mainstay of your community by far, you were going to levels of poverty. They actually had levels of poverty that nobody would have believed with all the talent because I see that I understand manufacturing. Remember? Manufacturing was never going to come back. Well, it did come back, and it came back big. But I understand. I have an aptitude for manufacturing. And I said, “It’s got to come back, and it will come back.”
Donald Trump: (05:57)
And we were doing great, and we’ll do now even better. We’re going to have a better year next year, I think, than almost any year in our history. And we were going through the single greatest year that we’ve ever had from an employment standpoint, from a stock market standpoint. And your 401ks right now, people have 401ks. They’re very happy with President Trump right now because they’re almost at the level that they were when the virus came over, but this is a mainstay of your community. And it was facing proposed and the prospect of a final layoff and a total downsize production, downsize to almost nothing. But this past April, Marinette’s fortunes turned around, and they turned around quickly. As part of my administration’s colossal rebuilding of the United States military, we’ve totally rebuilt the military, $2.5 trillion. And some people would say, “Well, that’s out of the budget.” I said, “Let me tell you something. There is no budget when it comes to our military because we don’t want the wrong people running up the front lawn of the White House, right?”
Donald Trump: (07:05)
If they were, I don’t want to say, “Well, maybe I did a lousy job with the military, but I did a great job on the budget.” No, thank you. No, thank you. Now we have an incredible… And you know what’s the greatest part about it? The greatest missiles in the world, greatest rockets. You saw the other day one of the rockets go off so successfully. The greatest ships, the greatest ships. These are the greatest of their kind anywhere in the world, the fastest, the most powerful, the greatest of everything. And you know the beautiful thing about it, it’s all made in the USA. It’s made by you and your counterparts. It’s made in the USA, the Army tanks from Ohio.
Donald Trump: (07:46)
As part of my administration’s rebuilding of the United States military, you were awarded a contract to build the next generation of guided missile frigate for the United States Navy, the FFG(X). FX, is that good? FX.
Donald Trump: (08:02)
FX. Is that good? FX. So you got the FFGX. Yeah, that’s right. That’s pretty good. What does that stand for please? Would you please tell me? Does anybody know? FFGX? I think nobody knows, but that’s okay. It sounds good to me, but it’s going to be built right here in the American heartland and it’s going to be built by you. And it’s going to go on for a long time because it’s up to 20 ships and it might be extended, and they’re working on an extension right now and we’ll see, but just go. You’re going to be building your hearts away, so good luck on the program. The massive deal is worth up to $5.5 billion. We’ll put the shipyard to work constructing some of the fastest, most advanced and most maneuverable combat ships anywhere in the ocean. I heard that maneuverability is one of the big factors that you were chosen for the contract. The other is your location in Wisconsin, if you want to know the truth.
Donald Trump: (09:03)
This contract will support your 1,500 full time employees, and it will also enable you to hire another 1,000 people all across the shipyards in Wisconsin. It’s one of the biggest contracts you’ve ever seen in the state. An estimated 15,000 additional new jobs will be created through the Wisconsin supply chain. You notice that’s not a supply chain going through China and going through other countries. It’s called the Wisconsin. Isn’t that nice? The Wisconsin supply chain.
Donald Trump: (09:37)
That’s been bugging me for about 25 years. I think that’s why I became president, you want to know the truth. What we’ve done with your great deal, the USMCA and Canada no longer takes advantage of us like they did. People don’t realize. Oh Canada, beautiful national anthem, right? Oh Canada, but they were brutal on trade. And now they have to treat us fairly. USMCA. We got rid of the worst trade deal ever made in the history of mankind, humankind. They like me to say nowadays humankind, right? Humankind. See the ladies. I think they like it the other way just as much. Humankind. But I just want to say that we have an incredible deal and it’s going to lead to a lot of very positive things.
Donald Trump: (10:21)
With the Wisconsin supply chain, 9,000 more jobs are going to be generated because of the chain itself and it’s a truly phenomenal achievement, and I congratulate you all. It’s going to be an incredible thing. It’s all going to be made right here in Wisconsin. Under this administration, you know that American workers like you are a national treasure. You are indeed victory at sea. Victory at sea, that’s what you lead us to. Your patriotism cannot be outsourced. Your eight decades of industrial heritage could not be replicated anywhere in the world.
Donald Trump: (10:58)
That’s why we’re protecting our defense and our defensive industrial base, which we’re building up stronger and stronger and stronger. And we have other places all over the country just like this. Well, let’s say this is better okay? But that’s okay. Just don’t tell anybody I said it, but we have places, great places, incredible people, tremendously, tremendously successful people, people with tremendous talent and we’re doing other things in other locations like the missiles, like the rockets, like the tanks, like all of the things that we’re building. It’s incredible when you see it. It’s incredible. People don’t realize the talent that we have.
Donald Trump: (11:41)
We started getting away from it. We started not building in the Navy. We haven’t built enough ships. The ships that they were building, they look terrible. I changed designs. I looked at it. I said, “That’s a terrible looking ship. Let’s make it beautiful. It’ll cost you the same and maybe less.” Sometimes you can make it look great for less money. I said, “This is not a good-looking ship. Let’s change the design of it.” And I got people in and we looked at different designs, and as long as we’re going to do it … And look at what you’re doing, how beautiful it is. They gave me a beautiful model that’s absolutely … It’s like a yacht with missiles on it okay? It’s beautiful. But you know, it’s true. You can build beautifully and it costs you sometimes less money, sometimes less money.
Donald Trump: (12:26)
So that’s why we’re protecting our defensive industrial base and restoring this fundamental principle, and that’s economic security is national security. That’s what it is because you know what you were going through in this area of Wisconsin just a short period of time ago. And it wasn’t right and it wasn’t fair. As long as I’m your president, America will never lose that ship building talent or capability. It won’t lose that excellence or the expertise of the men and the women of Marinette Marine. We’ll never lose that. Never lose it. And we’ll always live by two simple rules; buy American and hire American. Buy American and hire American.
Donald Trump: (13:18)
The first in class, FFGX will not just be a win for Wisconsin workers. It will also be a major victory for our Navy. And our Navy is just incredible, what we’re doing with our Navy. The stunning ships will deliver the overwhelming force, lethality and power we need to engage America’s enemies, anywhere and at any time. And with that, we don’t want to engage, but you know how you don’t have to engage? When you build a product like you’re building right there. When you build product like that, you don’t have to. When you don’t build product like that, and we go bare … We rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. When I became your president, we had planes that were 50 years old. We had a military that was tired. It was very tired from years of fighting, endless wars, wars that never stopped, and you see what’s happening at that front.
Donald Trump: (14:14)
We have the strongest military in the world by far and before we had an old, we had a very tired military. What we had were great people in the military, but they weren’t given the right equipment so now they are; two and a half trillion dollars. Each [inaudible 00:14:30] will boast a 32-cell vertical missile launcher to take American justice to any foe if necessary on air, land or sea. You know about it very well. You live with it. The ship will fuel the most advanced air research and air search radar capability in Naval history. There’s never been anything so advanced as what you’re building. Amazing. The ship is 30 times more powerful than the previous generation. That was one that got me. 30 times, think of that. 30 times more powerful than the previous generation, and it will carry an MH60 Seahawk helicopter and an unmanned MQHC Fire Scout drone.
Donald Trump: (15:22)
Through your sweat skill and devotion, the workers of this shipyard will forge the future of the United States Navy. You’re going to be a very big part of the United States Navy and there are other things coming. As you get set up with this, this is a lot to handle, but as you get set up, they’re going to be spending a lot of money on the renovation of the yard and the expansion of the yard. We have other things coming. And you’ll fashion the ultimate symbol of American power and American prestige. Wherever the FFGX cuts across the horizon, it will go as a 7,500 ton message to the world that American might is second to none.
Donald Trump: (16:01)
… Is second to none. That’s right. I’d like to take a moment to recognize just a few of the hardworking patriots who are helping to bring these monumental ships to life. And that’s what they are. Gary Iad is the third generation of his family to serve at this shipyard. He has worked here for 17 years and is now a production manager. Gary, please come up and say a few words, Gary. Thank you.
Gary Iad: (16:30)
Thank you, Mr. President. It is an honor to be here. My name is Gary. I’m a production manager here at Fincantieri Marinette Marine. I work in building 10, the one you just toured, the erection facility. I have been fortunate enough to be employed here for over 17 years. I started in the trades and through hard work and dedication I transitioned into management. These employees in front of you are here to build the best ships possible. The sense of pride felt when a ship gets launched or goes out on trials is like nothing else. These men and women breathe life into steel. Through hard work, long hours and dedication these individuals give the American war fighter, the ship he or she needs and deserves. Mr. President, Wisconsin, thanks you. The city of Marinette thanks you and Fincantieri Marinette Marine thanks you.
Donald Trump: (17:34)
Thank you very much, Gary.
Donald Trump: (17:40)
He looks like he’s 21 years old. He said he worked here a long time. Gary, whatever you’re doing it’s working. You look good. We’re also joined by Tyler Cahill. Tyler served for nine years in the US Navy, then returned here to his hometown to become a quality technical coordinator. Tyler also helps recruit young, talented people. Usually, I guess, from Wisconsin. I think probably, I don’t know if he accepts anybody from anywhere else. You’ll have to talk about that, I think. But I want to just ask Tyler, please come up and say a few words. Take you Tyler.
Tyler Cahill: (18:23)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (18:24)
Thank you.
Tyler Cahill: (18:25)
Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Tyler Cahill. I’m a native to the Marinette area, a former second class petty officer in the United States Navy Seabees, an Afghanistan War vet, a hockey coach and a quality coordinator here at Marinette Marine. When I first moved back to Marinette and started here as a welder in 2012, I would have never imagined how far my career and community would grow. The shipyard is a lifeline to the community and a driving force behind its economic growth. In major part due to the LCS program and the newly awarded frigate contract, I’ve seen young families move to the area, friends open new local businesses and a beautiful new sports facility opened to be utilized by the local hockey kids that I get to coach. None of this would have been possible without these contracts. So, once again, Mr. President, I’d like to say thank you in allowing us to continue supporting our nation’s Navy. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (19:23)
Thank you, Tyler.
Donald Trump: (19:27)
He looks like a tough hockey player. I wouldn’t want to be checking him, right? Tyler is a pretty tough looking guy. The dedication of the men and women here today will also help our military accomplish one of my top national security priorities, rebuilding a 355 ship Navy. As I told you, it went way down. Very sad. After years of painful budget cuts, we ended the last administration’s disastrous defense sequester. We ended the sequester. You know what that means, I think most of you? Let’s put it that way or this way, it was a very good thing that we did, otherwise you wouldn’t be building these ships right now. We ended what was a true disaster.
Donald Trump: (20:15)
We’ve invested the $2.5 trillion in all of the greatest equipment in the world and it’s all made here right in the USA and a lot of it is going to be made in Wisconsin, outside of this facility also. And I signed a new law creating, very importantly, this was something very important to me, the sixth branch of the US military, the space force. That’s a big deal. That’s a big deal. We’re revitalizing our partnerships around the world and insisting that other nations pay their fair share in NATO. They weren’t paying up and now many of them are. Some of them still don’t pay like they should, they’re delinquent. You know that word? They’re delinquent.
Donald Trump: (20:57)
No other president pressed them to pay. I press them to pay and the people at NATO are very happy with me, I will tell you. The secretary general said, “There’s never been anything like it. We took in $140 billion more money from other people, not from us, from other people paying their bills.” Because for many years they didn’t pay their bills. We were guarding nations and they weren’t paying for it. And somehow I said, “That doesn’t work too well.” Not for me and not for you either because you’re smart. This is great news for American workers and taxpayers as part of Saudi Arabia’s effort to fulfill its own defense obligations. Last year, the kingdom placed a $1.3 billion order for four new vessels made by your great company. So, you know the vessels that are getting built right now and we felt very strongly that this is where it should be and we gave them a strong recommendation and they followed it. That’s very good.
Donald Trump: (21:55)
Since 1942, when your company was founded to build five wooden barges for World War II, this small town in Wisconsin has raised up one of the premier ship building enterprises anywhere on earth and if you come back here in five years, you’ll see one of the top places anywhere in the world. You should take immense pride in what you’ve done and those before you, in many cases, your fathers and your grandfathers, in many cases, your fathers are alive and very proud of the job you’re doing. I met three people whose fathers worked here and it looked like it was ending and now they work here and they’re going to be here for a long time. And I said, “Get your son ready or get your daughter ready.” Your tradition of excellence has given America two classes of combat ships, the coast guard cutters that patrol our maritime borders, a state-of-the-art icebreaker, which is incredible, which we had not an easy time getting approved, I will tell you that. Democrats don’t like approving money for the military for whatever reason, some day you’ll explain that to me, they don’t like spending money on our military, and several of the Staten Island ferries, and so much more doing a lot of work.
Donald Trump: (23:10)
The workers of the shipyard and the people of this state have always prospered and persevered by holding fast to our shared American values. In this country we honor work, we celebrate great craftsmanship. I understand craftsmanship. I understand this world so well, you wouldn’t believe it. You wouldn’t believe it how well I understand it and how well I appreciate it. I appreciate talent and that’s real talent, craftsmanship. And we salute the dignity and nobility of the American worker. We look out for one that you wouldn’t believe. We look out for everybody. We’ll look out for one another. We’re loyal to one another and we love our families. We want our families taken care of. We want our families to prosper. We want our community to prosper. This community was not prospering with all that talent they-
Donald Trump: (24:03)
But this community was not prospering. With all that talent, they weren’t prospering, and now you’re all working and doing something that you love. I know most of you, you can’t wait to get to work. That’s the way I feel, and your job is much more pleasant than mine. That I can guarantee. That I can guarantee. You don’t know what I have to go through with these people. They said to me, “Sir,” a friend of mine, very smart, very successful person. Used to call me Donald, now he calls me sir. He says, “Mr. President.” I said, “Call me Donald.” “Yes, but I can’t, Mr. President.” Which is okay. He said, “So, which is the toughest nation to deal with? Is it China? Is it possibly Russia? Or is it maybe North Korea?” I said, “No. The toughest nation to deal with are the Democrats in the USA.”
Donald Trump: (24:58)
The Democrats in the USA are much tougher to deal with than any of these people that we deal with. They’re far more unreasonable, and actually, they’re a little crazy. We take care of our communities, and when the time comes, when history calls, when our flag is threatened, we defend our country like nobody else has ever defended our country or our flag. We defend our flag. We stand tall, we stand strong, and we always stand proud of the United States of America. With the help of everyone here today, this shipyard will continue to prosper, this state will continue to thrive, and this nation that we love will climb to new heights of glory and to greatness, and that’s what’s happening right now. We’re going to have a great third quarter and we’re going to have a phenomenal next year, you’ll see.
Donald Trump: (25:56)
Next year will be one of the greatest years. You see it happening already. It’s happening and it’s happening quickly. So, I want to thank everybody at this amazing yard. I want to thank the grandparents and the parents who put you here. They’re very proud of you. Some are looking down on you right now. They’re looking down from heaven, and they’re very proud of you. They’re very, very proud, and I’m also very proud of you. So, congratulations to you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (26:30)

"Jun 24, 2020",12:16 P.M. EDT,"President Donald Trump: (00:00)
Duda of Poland, who has done an incredible job. And I do believe he has an election coming up, and I do believe he’ll be very successful. So thank you very much. And all of your representatives, thank you very much for being here. This is the third time that we’ve hosted President Duda. The First Lady and I also cherish our remarkable visit to Poland three years ago. That was an amazing event. We had an event, because it was a speech, and a lot of people watched that speech. But it was a very historic moment, and an important moment for our two countries.
President Donald Trump: (00:34)
The American and Polish people enjoy one of the world’s oldest, strongest, and most enduring friendships. Polish patriots battled by our side to secure American independence. American and Polish warriors fought and died together to defeat the Nazis in World War II. The United States stood shoulder to shoulder with Poland in its courageous struggle against communist oppression.
President Donald Trump: (00:59)
Our bond has been forged in battle, sealed in blood, and strengthened by our shared cultural values. The United States and Poland are united by our firm conviction. That Western civilization has advanced, really and very much advanced I think I have to add, the cause of human progress beyond measure. And that it must be strongly defended, and will at all times be strongly defended. And we will defend it together.
President Donald Trump: (01:29)
In our meeting today, President Duda and I reaffirmed the vital alliance between our nations. Last year, we signed two joint declarations to increase our security collaboration. And we look forward to signing a defense cooperation agreement. Poland recently purchased 32 brand new, state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets. The best in the world. And Poland is one of only eight NATO members… The others, some of them haven’t done so well in terms of what they’re supposed to be paying to NATO. I tell them all the time. And we’ve gotten them up a lot, but not enough. But Poland is one of only eight that is current with the money that they are supposed to be paying. That’s the two percent. Two percent is very low number. But we have a large number of countries that haven’t paid. They’re delinquent. Let’s put it that way. They’re delinquent with respect to their dues, the money they’re supposed to be paying for defense. So the United States is defending a lot of countries. They’re delinquent on what they’re supposed to be paying. And I never feel too good about that.
President Donald Trump: (02:38)
But I will say, I spoke with the Secretary General. And he said we’ve done a great job. But I said we haven’t done good enough. We haven’t done a good enough job. We have secured though, over $400 billion in new pledged defense spending from NATO members, which is something that no other administration has come even close to. I would say they were off by many hundreds of billions of dollars, something the newspaper doesn’t like writing about, that the media doesn’t like talking about. But we will be only satisfied when all members are paying their fair share. Again, only eight members, plus the United States is paying what is considered a fair share.
President Donald Trump: (03:21)
I also applaud Poland and the Polish people for its devotion to safeguarding their country’s borders, very strong borders. And I just left our border, by the way. The wall is moving along rapidly. And our border is about as strong as it’s ever been, our southern border. Last year, we were able to add Poland to the visa waiver program. And they wanted that very badly. And we gave it to them because they really deserve it. It’s a testament to Poland’s vigilant efforts to uphold the rule of law.
President Donald Trump: (03:52)
The United States and Poland have recently signed several longterm contracts for US liquefied natural gas, they’re a big purchaser of our energy, to enhance Poland’s energy security. And we’re working to conclude an agreement that would facilitate Poland’s development of nuclear energy plants. Throughout the purchase they are going to be purchasing with one of our very big, very good companies, technology to do civilian nuclear energy.
President Donald Trump: (04:26)
I want to congratulate Poland for its leadership in the Three Seas Initiative, a crucial energy partnership that will provide a reliable source of energy for Eastern Europe. And it will be free from the threat of foreign extortion. Poland understands foreign extortion very well. The Three Seas Initiative relies on fairness, transparency, and mutual benefit. Our nations have also collaborated on protecting our critical infrastructure and technology. That’s why we’ve signed a 5G joint declaration. And Poland is leading the way in Europe by using trusted providers, and provider equipment, and supply chains for its 5G network. And we’re working along with them, and they using our companies.
President Donald Trump: (05:14)
The United States and Poland cooperate across the truly wide range of fronts that we’re both very much involved in. Here today, is the head of a Polish medical team, very advanced team, very brilliant team fighting the coronavirus alongside of American doctors, Captain Siewiera. Captain. Thank you very much for being here, captain. And we’re making great progress. I hear we’re making great progress, and we’re working together. But we are making great progress on therapeutics and vaccines. Thank you very much. Appreciate you being here.
President Donald Trump: (05:51)
The American and Polish people have been true friends and trusted partners for almost 250 years. We’re forever united by our shared belief in family, faith, law, liberty, democracy, and justice. As the old Polish motto goes, we will stand together in the name of God for our freedom and for yours.
President Donald Trump: (06:13)
President Duda, let me express once again, our gratitude for your visit and friendship. We have had a very special relationship. Our alliance is powerful, and a very powerful testament to what free people can achieve together. And I believe that the greatness of our relationship lies ahead. Thank you very much. President, please. Thank you.
President Duda: (06:38)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. [foreign language 00:06:39].
President Duda (Interpreter): (06:41)
Ladies and gentlemen, first and foremost, I’d like to thank very warmly to President Donald Trump, to the President of the United States of America. Thank you very much for inviting me here to Washington, to the White House, to take part in this very important meeting to us. This meeting is important for many reasons. To me, as President of the Republic of Poland, this meetings is important because Poland is the first country after the coronavirus pandemic, which has been invited to the meeting in the White House to discuss the most important matters concerning the future, concerning how the relations will look between the United States and Poland in terms of economy, what those relations will be like in the military sphere, and what those relations will be like in the sphere of health protection. All those elements which are of key importance today.
President Duda (Interpreter): (07:35)
A very big part of our discussions today with Mr. President and our collaborators, were dedicated to the coronavirus, to what the situation looks like in Europe, and on the global stage as concerns the fight against the coronavirus, also in the United States. But first and foremost, we’re also thinking about what measures to take in the future. But first and foremost, thank you so much Mr. President for your declaration that we are going to cooperate, that also our scientists are going to cooperate and collaborate on conducting research concerning the vaccine, and therapy drug against coronavirus. Everything that will be conducive to fighting the coronavirus.
President Duda (Interpreter): (08:16)
So I do believe thanks to this collaboration, those therapeutical medicines will be available also for Poles, for my compatriots as soon as possible. Thank you so much President for that. Because all of us know very well, how high level of medical research is in the United States. And this declaration and the will of cooperation on part of the United States, on part of the President of the United States is of crucial importance to us. So thank you very much for that.
President Duda (Interpreter): (08:40)
But ladies and gentlemen, we also discussed the cooperation in the sphere of economy and military. And let me first mention our economic operation. As the president has just mentioned, we are developing it both in the sphere of energy in building energy security. Today we can say that the United States is cooperating in the sphere of creating energy security. Not only the energy security of Poland, but also the energy security of Central Europe.
President Duda (Interpreter): (09:06)
The president has just mentioned the Three Seas Initiative. Yes, all the investments that are being carried out in Poland today. The extension of the capacity of LNG terminal Świnoujście. We’re increasing its capacity by 2.5 billion cubic meters. We also plan to construct another LNG terminal in the port of Gdansk. All of that is conducive to being able to receive LNG gas, and provide its deliveries not only across Poland, but also for the countries of Central Europe. The vast majority of those countries of Central Europe are still dependent on Russia. And creating a true alternative. In other words, diversification of supplies is of key importance for their security.
President Duda (Interpreter): (09:45)
Thank you, Mr. President, for this cooperation. I do believe that we’re going to further develop it. Today we have got those supplies guaranteed until 2023, by the end of 2023. But I know that we are also going to enter into further contracts in that respect. Even more so that for sure, our demand is going to in
President Duda (Interpreter): (10:03)
Even more so that for sure our demand is going to increase. But, ladies and gentlemen, we also discussed conventional energy and nuclear energy cooperation. In the nearest future, an agreement will be signed between the governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Poland. Thanks to this agreement, we’ll be able to start designing the large design of introducing conventional nuclear energy for the production of electricity in Poland. The entities which will participate in this project have already been selected, and the agreements are very advanced on the Polish side. We have got Minister Piotr Naimski, who is in charge of those negotiations right now, and the appropriate intergovernmental agreement is about to be concluded and finalized. We can expect that to happen in the near future. But ladies and gentlemen, I also want to mention the contribution of the United States into the 3Cs initiative. And first and foremost, the financial contribution to fund of the 3Cs initiative.
President Duda (Interpreter): (11:01)
Mr. President got interested in that fund sometime ago. This is an element, an vehicle which enables the development of this corporation. Thank you, Mr. President for your activity. And thank you for appreciating this cooperation, which takes place in central Europe within the framework of the European Union. And the goal of this collaboration is to develop, to extend the infrastructure. Thank you for noticing the possibility of developing cooperation in the transatlantic zone between the countries of the European Union and the United States. And of course from my point of view, this cooperation with Poland is extremely important to me, but also in the economic sphere where it’s speaking about increasing military cooperation between Poland and the United States, it is also of primary importance. I have no doubts whatsoever that this cooperation will lead to the strengthening of security of the European Union strengthening the security of the Eastern flank of NATO, but also, and perhaps first and foremost, from my perspective, it will strengthen the security of Poland, and it will also land additional financial credibility to Poland, investment credibility on part of American investors.
President Duda (Interpreter): (12:05)
One month ago, a global company, Microsoft announced that they’re going to invest $1 billion in Poland to establish a state of the art data center. And today officially, Google company published the information that is also going to invest in the center of modern technologies in Poland, including IT technologies. This is going to be an even greater investment than investment of Microsoft. So Mr. President, I have no doubts whatsoever that these American investments and this additional investment impulse that the American companies are making right now, results from a very efficient policy that we are conducting together and which increases the sense of safety of our citizens in Poland. And it also increases that sense of safe investments in our country. Thank you so much for that, because that means the creation of new jobs in the state of the art branch of industry IT technologies.
President Duda (Interpreter): (12:58)
And I’m really pleased because in Poland, we have got a large number of excellent, young IT experts also young IT engineers. And for sure we’re able to come to terms with these very serious challenges. Also, as far as intellectual capital is concerned, I’m sure that these investments are going to be beneficial for the United States, for the US companies and also for Poland through creating jobs, through requiring new experiences by young people in a first place by young engineers. I’m also glad Mr. President, because as we said before, the agreements that we entered into concerning increased US military persons in Poland, the agreements we signed last year, according to the first one, the US force is going to be increased by 1000 troops in our country and another, a contract and other agreements stipulated concrete locations in which US soldiers will be stationed in Poland on the rotational basis.
President Duda (Interpreter): (13:55)
But also it’s going to be a heel to toe rotation. Today, we are entering another stage. Namely there is a possibility of further increase in American troops in our country. In recent days, I also talked to secretary general of NATO. I talked to Mr. Ian Stoltenberg, and we agreed on one point, especially as Europeans, we have no doubts whatsoever that if any part of the US armed forces, which is the biggest armed forces in the world was withdrawn from Europe, that would be very detrimental to European security. So we believe it is deeply justified to ensure that the US troops are left in Europe. So Mr. President, thank you so much for listening today. Thank you so much for accepting Poland during this meeting at the white house, we are the first country which has been received after this long break in international diplomacy.
President Duda (Interpreter): (14:53)
Thank you for your words about our pride and heroes of Poles over history today, Polish soldiers stand arm-in-arm with US soldiers. We are tested allies together with appealed obliged in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we stand ready, always ready to implement our allied obligations and commitment. And thank you that the United States, thanks to your policy, Mr. President is demonstrating itself as an absolutely loyal ally to us. And thank you that we can count on the United States. Also I’d like to say that I’m grateful Mr. President, that you have been stressing historical truths in such a decisive way. This is extremely important to us, Poles finding disinformation, defending historical truth. Also about the second world war about who started the war, about the course of the war is incredibly important to us. And thank you, Mr. President, that you are adopting this stance and contributing so much to putting the record straight.
President Duda (Interpreter): (15:56)
It’s important also to us, from the point of view of our dignity, the second world war was a period of great drama and trauma in the history of our nation, we lost 5 million citizens, and that was a tragedy to us. So because of that, it is important to spread this truth to present it as it really was. But it’s also important to speak about the heroism of Poles, wherever they were fighting, wherever they were spilling their blood arm-in-arm with their allies at Monte Casino at Tobruk and at other places all over the world. Both on the eastern front and on the western front, all of that saying that is extremely important. So I’m happy that today we can [inaudible 00:16:37] our security in the United States. I’m glad that we have got this excellent economic corporation. So Mr. President, I have no doubt whatsoever that the coronavirus pandemic will pass and we will be going together towards the development of our countries, towards the development of our societies, towards the building of a better, more prosperous future, both for the United States, for Poland and for Europe. Thank you so much.
President Donald Trump: (17:02)
Ask one to me and one to the President, and that would be great. Steve Holland, go ahead.
Steve Holland: (17:15)
Poland, would you send them from Germany and what sort of signal would that send to Russia? And for President Duda, how do you feel about this? Taking some troops out of Germany to go to Poland? And what signal does that send to Russia? Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (17:32)
Well, just to start, as you know, Poland as I’ve said, many times, Poland is one of the few countries that are fulfilling their obligations under NATO, the particular, their monetary obligations. And they asked us if we would send some additional troops, they’re going to pay for that. There’ll be paying for the sending of additional troops and we’ll probably be moving them from Germany to Poland. We’re going to be reducing Germany very substantially down to about 25,000 troops. We actually had 52,000, but we’ll be moving it down to about 25,000.
President Donald Trump: (18:07)
Germany’s paying a very small fraction of what they’re supposed to be paying. They should be paying 2% and they’re paying a little bit more than 1%, depending on how you calculate. You could also calculate that they’re paying less than 1%, but if you assume that paying 1%, that’s a tremendous delinquency. Let’s use that word, delinquency. So we’re going to be reducing our forces in Germany. Some will be coming home and some will be going to other places, but Poland would be one of those other places, other places in Europe.
Steve Holland: (18:41)
Send to Russia by doing this?
President Donald Trump: (18:43)
I think it sends a very strong signal to Russia, but I think a stronger signal sent to Russia is the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars to purchase energy from Russia and through the pipeline. And I’m saying, “What’s that all about? You’re spending billions of dollars to Russia then we’re supposed to defend you from Russia?” So I think it’s a very bad, I think the people of Germany are very unhappy about it. I have many friends from Germany and the people in Germany are very unhappy about it. They don’t like it, but that’s what they chose to do. So they’re spending billions of dollars to buy Russian energy and then we’re supposed to defend them from Russia.
President Donald Trump: (19:18)
So that doesn’t work too well. But Poland has been very, very terrific. In fact, I don’t believe Poland is actually accepting any of the energy from the pipeline from Russia. So that sends a signal right there. With all of that being said, we expect to get along with Russia. We expect to get along with everybody, but Germany, they really owe a lot of money in NATO. And this has been going on for many years. When you add it all up, you’re probably getting close to a trillion dollars and that’s not treating NATO fairly, but it really isn’t treating the United States fairly. You know, the United States is a very, is the major participant in NATO. We pay more than anybody else by far, have for many, many years. So we defend Europe.
President Donald Trump: (20:03)
Anybody else by far have for many, many years. So we defend Europe, but Europe also takes tremendous advantage of the United States on trade. Advantage like you wouldn’t believe. So we’re trying to work that out. And I would imagine they’d like to wait until after the election so that maybe they could deal with somebody other than President Trump. But after the election, they’ll just have to pay more. But that’s the way it is. Okay? Thank you very much. Please.
Speaker 1: (20:27)
[inaudible 00:00:28].
President Duda (Interpreter): (20:28)
Sir, first of all, I do respect very much both Mr. President Donald Trump and the United States of America. A wonderful, great state, which today is the largest military and economic superpower in the world. And I wouldn’t dare say to the President of the United States of America where he should send his soldiers, because this is the decision which is always taken by the United States. This is a very responsible decision. However, I do not deny that I requested Mr. President that he would not withdraw US forces from Europe because the security of Europe is very important to me. From Europe as such, I’m talking about the United Europe, for which the American persons, since the end of the second world war is a huge security guarantee. However, if I’m asked by anybody if I am ready, that Poland receives more US troops in our country, of course I am ready. In 2014, Russia attacked Ukraine, it annexed Crimea, it occupies Luhansk and Donetsk. Before that, it had attacked Georgia. 2014 was a year of huge fears, huge fears, the Baltic States, and very big ones, very considerable ones among the Polish society.
President Duda (Interpreter): (21:48)
Today, the presence of native troops and first and foremost of US troops in Poland demonstrates that Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty is treated seriously. And it shows that if anyone wanted to attack Poland, it won’t be a soft landing for that entity. That won’t pay off for such an aggressor because the strongest army of the world is present and they would help Polish soldiers to defend our borders if such a case arises. 100 years ago, we repelled Russians from Warsaw. In a great battle in 1920, we defeated the [inaudible 00:22:23] army Bolsheviks and we drove them back to the east. That was a great victory, but we managed to stop them only very near to war. So at the outskirts of our capital city, we would never want to see that situation repeated again. That is why the [inaudible 00:22:38] presence is crucially important to us today and it is a very important security guarantee to us.
President Duda (Interpreter): (22:43)
So I’m very pleased that both within NATO, as well as in the United States and today, that President of the United States understands the history of Europe and he understands the realities in Europe, and that he also understands the situation as it is developing in Europe. So today, this generates peace to my country, it brings security. And thanks to that, Russia, unfortunately, the very strong Imperial ambitions, which have been revived over the last tens of years, I can say, because Georgia was attacked in 2008, thanks to this, those ambitions have been stopped for the time being, at least in this part of the world. And I have no doubt whatsoever that this is also a huge merit of the policy of the United States. I’m grateful for that just like all my compatriots are.
President Donald Trump: (23:30)
I want to add 2014, which the President was talking about, that was a year where Russia had a good time with the United States. To the best of my knowledge, President Obama and sleepy Joe Biden, they were in power. They were the ones that were doing it. This was before us. Hasn’t happened with us. And it won’t happen with us either. Please go ahead.
Speaker 1: (23:56)
[foreign language 00:24:02]
President Duda (Interpreter): (24:00)
[foreign language 00:00:24:04].
Speaker 2: (24:01)
President, you had to cancel your last trip, your last visit to Poland because of the hurricane. Are you planning a new visit to Poland in the near future? And the second question is on COVID. Is there a chance for Poland to participate in the development and early access, both to the vaccine and to the therapeutics? [foreign language 00:04:21].
President Duda (Interpreter): (24:21)
Mr. President, is there a chance that during this cooperation with the United States we’ll get an fast access, both to the vaccine as well as to concrete drugs against coronavirus?
President Donald Trump: (24:36)
And we’d like to do it again, as soon as we can. We have an election happening in this country, as you probably have heard. And so I probably won’t be able to do it until after the election. But assuming things go well, the answer is a very definite yes, actually. As far as the joining with us on the vaccines and therapeutics, by the way, because the therapeutics to me, if you gave me a choice right now, probably therapeutically, maybe I’d like that even better, but we’re working very well on both. I think we’re coming up with some great answers. I think you’re going to have a big surprise, a beautiful surprise, sooner than anybody would think. But the answer is yes, we will be getting Poland involved, both in terms of helping, but also in terms of taking care of the Polish people once we have the vaccine. But I think we’re going to have it very soon. Okay? Thank you.
Speaker 1: (25:25)
[foreign language 00:25:27].
President Duda (Interpreter): (25:28)
Sir, we got involved as a state in the cooperation and also in supporting allies, be it in a symbolic dimension, of the United States in the fight against coronavirus. That is why we have here with us today a Captain medical doctor from Poland. I want to say yes, of course. I’m working on this obvious assumption that by taking part in the research and also by being, in a certain sense, co-creators of the vaccines and therapeutics, Poles will be able to count on these vaccines and therapeutics to be available for it at Poles as soon as possible. So speaking openly, this is also the intention I have in my cooperation with the United States of America, to make sure that these vaccines are available to Poles and to other nations, wherever they will be applied as soon as possible.
President Donald Trump: (26:22)
Okay. Thank you very much. John, please.
John: (26:25)
Thank you, Mr. President. This afternoon, the bill on reform in the Senate failed to move forward. It may still see the light of day at some point, but at the moment, it’s stalled in the Senate. As well, you have an executive order that is coming out later on this week regarding monuments and what to do about people who deface or damage these monuments. Could you tell us what you’re planning to do in the executive order and your reaction to what happened in the Senate?
President Donald Trump: (26:55)
Well, the Senate Republicans want very much to pass a bill on police reform. We have total cooperation with many different communities, including the police community. They want it very much to happen themselves because there are things that they agree to, that they would like to agree to, and they would love to have it agreed to formally. The Democrats don’t want to do it because they want to weaken our police, they want to take away immunity, they want to do other things that you know about as well as anybody in this beautiful field that we set. They want to take away a lot of the strength from our police and from law enforcement generally. And we can’t live with that. We can’t live with it. This is a great bill, strongly endorsed by, as you know, Tim Scott, who’s terrific, who is a terrific man, great Senator, South Carolina. And Mitch wants it to happen, I would like to see it happen. But we won’t sacrifice, we won’t do that. We won’t do anything that’s going to hurt our police.
President Donald Trump: (28:01)
The police, we have a record this year on crime, a record positive rating on crime this year, the best. And you hear about certain places like Chicago, and you hear about what’s going on in Detroit and other cities, all Democrat run. Every one of them is Democrat run. 20 out of 20. The 20 worst, the 20 most dangerous are Democrat run. We have one city or two cities in particular, worse than Honduras, worse than Afghanistan, worse than Afghanistan. And these are cities within the United States. Democrat run, radical left run. You see what’s going on in Seattle, you see what’s going on in other places. Seattle, of all places, who would even think that’s possible? 20 out of 20. The Democrats want to weaken very substantially our law enforcement and our police. And frankly, they want to defund largely, at least largely. There are some that want to defund and abolish our police, if you can believe that. And we’re not letting that happen. So if nothing happens with it, it’s one of those things. We have different philosophies. They want open borders, they want sanctuary cities, we don’t.
President Donald Trump: (29:13)
As far as your number, your second question, I think that we’re going to have a very strong executive order, but we already have very strong. We have the monuments act already, which means 10 years in jail. But I think we’re going to consolidate various things. We’re going to come out with a very strong executive order. And I should have that by the end of the week, which is fast approaching. We’re going to have a very, very, very powerful statement. We’ve arrested numerous people, as you know, for what took place outside of Washington. In addition, the FBI is investigating hundreds of people throughout the country for what they’ve done to monument statues and even buildings. So we have very strong laws already on the books and we have a law that’s 10 years. It’s 10 years. That’s a long time. To have fun one-
President Donald Trump: (30:03)
…years. It’s 10 years, that’s a long time, to have fun one night. I think many of the people that are knocking down these statues don’t even have any idea what the statue is, what it means, who it is. When they knocked down Grant, when they want to knock down Grant, but when they look at certain… Now they’re looking at Jesus Christ, they’re looking at George Washington, they’re looking at Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson: not going to happen, not going to happen. Not as long as I’m here.
President Donald Trump: (30:31)
As far as Democrats are concerned, I think they could care less whether or not it happens. And I think the American people get it. So we’re going to have a very strong executive order and it’ll happen very quickly before the end of the week.
John: (30:48)
We have an election coming up in November. You have an election coming up on Sunday. Some of your critics who are politicians here in the United States have criticized this visit to the White House saying it is tantamount to election interference because it shows a very close relationship between the United States and Poland at a time when you really need it. What do you say to those critics? And Mr. President, feel free to weigh in if you want to.
President Duda: (31:13)
[foreign language 00:31:14].
President Duda (Interpreter): (31:16)
So first of all, let me also followup on the question that you asked to President Donald Trump. I’d like to thank you, Mr. President, because among others not a long time ago the monument to General Kosciuszko was devastated. That was the national hero of Poland but also the national hero of the United States who was fighting for the independence of the United States. He had great merits and he was also the commander of a Polish uprising where he was fighting for the independence of Poland. He suffered heavy wounds in Poland, fighting for the independence of our country and for completely incomprehensible reasons to us, that monument was devastated recently. And thank you so much that it has been renewed so fast and that made it possible for me to lay flowers at that monument and pay tribute to a great soldier and a great commander.
President Duda (Interpreter): (32:13)
Thank you for that. That was outrageous for a big number of Polish people back in Poland, all of them probably, and for many, many Polish people living here also in the United States. Polish organizations here in the United States asked me and told me that they would renew that monument. I know that it has already been renewed by the United States, no assistance was needed. So I’m very grateful for that, that here, the monumental of Kosciuszko tends near the White House and who looks as he should look, which he has deserved for the merits he laid for the United States and for Poland. So thank you very much for that, Mr. President.
President Duda (Interpreter): (32:48)
And answering to your question, two months ago, at the very beginning of the pandemic of coronavirus, we had a lengthy conversation with President Donald Trump. The pandemic disrupted the plans of our corporation, which we had. And back then we made an arrangement with Mr. President that we would meet as soon as it would be possible. And this has been implemented. And the fact that this arrangement has been put into force is demonstrated by the visit today. I’m very grateful to Mr. President for inviting me here today and together with Mr. President, we are implementing our presidential duties.
President Duda (Interpreter): (33:23)
The president is always in charge of his national interests and this is the task of the president. When the president is acting in the international sphere, this is my sense and I also know that also it is a very strong belief of President Donald Trump, the president is supposed to realize the interest of their country. So Mr. President Trump is realizing the interest of his own country and I’m realizing the interest of Poland. So we are looking for a win, win situation where both parties are the winners, where both parties are able to implement their interests as part of the cooperation which we are implementing. This is the way we act. And in this very moment, we are acting on a national level and the state level. We are just fulfilling our obligations and duties as presidents of our countries, as those who are representing our nations and who want our societies to have as good lives as possible. Thank you very much.
President Donald Trump: (34:10)
He’s doing very well in Poland, he’s doing a terrific job. The people of Poland think the world of him. And, by the way, Mrs. Duda, Who is a terrific woman, terrific woman who we’ve gotten to know also through our various travels and meetings. But they think the world of him and I don’t think he needs my help. I’m honored that this is a day that’s, I guess, just before your election, I’m honored but he will do very well with or without us. He’s going to have a great success and Poland is going to continue on. They’re doing incredibly well as a country. Okay, please. Thank you.
President Duda (Interpreter): (34:47)
Thank you very much Mr. President. Best regards to your wife. [foreign language 00:04:56]
President Duda: (34:56)
Polish television.
President Duda (Interpreter): (34:57)
Good morning [foreign language 00:00:35:00] Polish television.
Speaker 3: (35:01)
I want to ask about timing of that visit. President Andrzej Duda is the first president, the first international guest in the White House since the lockdown. And today there was a big military parade in Moscow. Can we combine those two facts? Is it proved that Poland is an important partner for America? Can we treat it that we can rely on America and Poland? Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (35:28)
Well, I think you can and we also are working with Russia right now on an arms treaty which is a very big thing, nuclear arms specifically, but we’re working very much and I think I can say, Mike, we’re doing very well on that. We’re two countries that want to see it happen and we’re working on other things with Russia. We have a very good relationship, we have our ambassador over there right now who will be attending certain festivities and that’s a good thing. And I think that’s frankly a good thing for Poland also.
President Donald Trump: (35:58)
Likewise, we’re going to be having very important dignitaries at your parade. You’re going to be having a very big event soon and we’re going to be in August and we’re going to have people representing the United States at a very high level. And that’s very important to us also. Okay. Please.
President Duda: (36:18)
[foreign language 00:36:17].
President Duda (Interpreter): (36:20)
Sir, I have this feeling and sense that I’m conducting negotiations in Polish matters here in very experienced and very tough politician, tough player I can say that is President Donald Trump, who is standing strongly and looking to the interest of his country and he’s citizens. What I’m doing here is I’m representing public industry here and I’m not parading in Moscow. That is all. Thank you very much.
President Donald Trump: (36:47)
Thank you all very much. We will see you soon. Thank you. Thank you very much. [crosstalk 00:36:52]"
"Jun 18, 2020",4:10 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Governor Pete Ricketts of Nebraska. Pete, thank you very much. And a man that I’m going to see a little bit over the weekend, and this was really by coincidence that you happen to be here today because it was for a different reason. It has to do with small business, Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma. We’re going to be in Oklahoma and it’s a crowd like I guess nobody’s seen before. We have a tremendous, tremendous request for tickets. I think probably has never happened politically before. One of the reasons we chose your state as you know, Kevin was that you’ve done so, so well with the COVID. You’ve handled it incredibly well. We appreciate… You both have actually. You both have, so congratulations. Along with several extraordinary small business owners from their state. Also with us, our Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin and small business administrator Jovita.
Donald Trump: (00:57)
Thank you Jovita. Very good. Small business is no longer small businesses, it’s big business. It’s one of the biggest businesses. As a result of the virus 22% of small businesses were forced to close earlier this year, including 41% of black owned businesses. But under my administration strategy to vanquish the virus and restart our economy, small businesses across the nation are now safely reopening. All over the nation they’re reopening at levels like nobody’s seen before. We’re sheltering individuals at the highest risk. If you look at really high risk individuals, we are really watching them and we’re taking care of them and we know what the high risk means, but largely it means older people, especially older people, senior citizens that have a tremendous… They have a problem. If they have a heart problem, if they have diabetes, if they have any kind of a problem, they’re much more susceptible. We’re all watching that very closely. We’ve learned a lot over the last number of months. In the past four months, we’ve conducted over 25 million coronavirus tests and distributed over 1.5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment. America’s better supplied and more prepared to reenter then I would say just about any other place. You look at what we’ve done with ventilators. We’re now making thousands a week of ventilators, very big, expensive, complex equipment, and we’re sending them to other countries and we’re all stocked up. Our country is totally stocked up. Everybody has their ventilators at maximum they can use, but we are sending them to other countries. The nice part, and I say it a lot because I think it’s pretty amazing, when we came here you had very few ventilators in this country. By the time we started not one person that needed a ventilator, didn’t get it. Everybody that needed a ventilator got a ventilator. There wasn’t one instance anywhere in our country. We stocked up those shelves. The cupboard was empty and we filled up the cupboards.
Donald Trump: (03:08)
In the past four months tremendous things have happened, but I think probably the biggest thing of all is the knowledge that we’ve gained of this disease, of this plague, of this virus. Call it what you want. To help small businesses survive the shutdown I approved over $670 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program. And Steve that’s been a tremendous success. And we’re talking with Democrats about doing something further now, but the numbers, the way they’re coming in, it’s been really incredible. So we’re able to spot it, but we’re here to help businesses and to help people. To date we’ve processed over 4.6 million small business loans saving and supporting an estimated 50 million American jobs.
Donald Trump: (03:56)
Jovita, that’s incredible. The small business owners that we have with us this afternoon all received the PPP loans and now their businesses are under the road to recovery and they’re doing really well. We have a lot of businesses that are doing really well. We’re talking about a V-shape, we’re almost like an eye shape, I is straight up and down, but I talked about V-shape and a lot of people disagreed with me, not everybody, but a lot of very smart Wall Streeters were disagreeing. Now they’re pretty much coming on board saying it looks like it could be a V. So, a V is the thing we were shooting for and it looks like that’s what we’ve got.
Donald Trump: (04:31)
I want to thank our people and my representatives for their decisive actions. Last month we added a record 2.5 million jobs. It’s the highest in the history of our country in one month. That’s the highest number of jobs. 2.5 million, the Dow rose above 26,000 points. We saw the largest surge in retail sales ever recorded. Next year is shaping up to be one of the greatest years in the history of our country from an economic standpoint. I truly believe that. I think we’re going to have a great third quarter. We’re going to have a great fourth quarter. And next year is going to be a phenomenal year. I believe that NASDAQ actually set the record during a pandemic. NASDAQ just said they broke their record. Larry, is that a correct statement? So it was higher than even before. it’s an amazing achievement.
Donald Trump: (05:24)
After I was elected president our country added more than seven million jobs, 12,000 factories and trillions of dollars of wealth. We created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones and African American, Asian American and Hispanic American unemployment, and poverty reached all time lows. We had the greatest employment numbers we’ve ever had. Then we had to turn it off. We saved millions of people by doing it. We did the right thing and now we’re turning it back on and the numbers are going up much, much faster than anybody would have thought. It’s a great honor to see it. And these two governors, by the way have done a fantastic job. Two very extraordinary men, Nebraska and Oklahoma.
Donald Trump: (06:09)
We built the strongest economy the world has ever seen before the virus and together we’re doing it again. So we did it before the virus. We had to turn it off and now we’re doing it again and that’s what’s happening. So now I’d like to maybe we’ll start off with Governor Ricketts and then we’ll get to my friend over here. I’ll be seeing so much of you in the next couple of days. I’ll take you a second. Thank you very much, please.
Pete Ricketts: (06:34)
Well, thank you very much, Mr. President, and to all of your team here. We really appreciate your effort, your leadership, and that of your teams’ to be able to help us through this pandemic and really give us the tools to be able to manage it. The PPE program you mentioned has been tremendously successful in Nebraska. Because of the great relationships our community bankers have with our small businesses, we were able to take advantage of that and really cover over 80% of our payroll. It really was a fantastic way to be able to keep people working. We had the third lowest unemployment rate in April, and we want to keep people in their jobs. We really appreciate all the work you’re doing. You may recall, we were one of the few states that didn’t issue a stay at home order or shelter in place order.
Pete Ricketts: (07:17)
What we did is try to take common sense steps, and ask people to take responsibility, to be able to follow the directives that you all were putting out with regard to avoiding large groups, washing their hands, that sort of thing and making sure they keep six feet and distance in public, that sort of thing. And by doing that and targeting specific higher risk businesses that we asked to shut down for a shorter period of time, we were able to be able to stem the tide of the virus. We’ve actually got the lowest hospitalizations in our state right now we had since the end of April. It’s got a nice bell shaped curve. It went up and now it’s coming back down. Our cases are steady and flat, and now we’re just really in the mode of managing this. You put the 25 person rule in-
Pete Ricketts: (08:03)
… managing this. You put the 25 person rule in place in mid-March and that bought us the time to be able to strengthen our contact tracing-
Donal Trump: (08:08)
Right.
Pete Ricketts: (08:08)
… our testing, our PPE, our quarantine space, put plans in place to help at risk populations and put our rules in place. And that’s what gave us the opportunity to be able to manage it. So we really appreciate all that you’ve done Mr. President. Thank you.
Donal Trump: (08:22)
Well, you’ve done great. And thank you very much. And how did you do with your floods? Because you had tremendous floods.
Pete Ricketts: (08:27)
We’re still actually recovering from the floods from last year, so we’ve got the double whammy. Agriculture in particular has really taken a heavy hit between what happened then, last year with the flooding and then to the pandemic this year. But again, your administration has been helpful. The phase one China deal for example-
Donal Trump: (08:42)
Right.
Pete Ricketts: (08:42)
… gives a great mark to be able to sell things. So we really appreciate all that you’re doing to help us recover through these terrible tragedies.
Donal Trump: (08:47)
And they are buying a lot aren’t they?
Pete Ricketts: (08:49)
They are, they are and that helps. That makes such a difference. Mr. President, I can’t tell you. When people aren’t driving, they’re not using ethanol. Right? Because that gets blended into our fuel supply. When our food processing facilities are impacted by coronavirus and they’re slowing down, our ranchers don’t have a place to take their animals. So there’s a lot of impact to agriculture and your administration has been great and working with us to be able to help them through it.
Donal Trump: (09:13)
That’s great. Thank you very much.
Pete Ricketts: (09:13)
Thanks.
Donal Trump: (09:15)
Appreciate it, Governor.
Kevin Stitt: (09:17)
Well, thank you so much for having us, Mr. President. And on behalf of Oklahoma, we’re so excited to have you. And like you said, I don’t know if people caught that, but over a million people have requested tickets to come to this event. So it’s just going to be an amazing, Oklahoma’s ready for your visit. It’s going to be safe and we’re really, really excited.
Kevin Stitt: (09:37)
But during this whole a COVID crisis, as we’ve been fighting it, your administration has been having calls twice a week. The Vice President have been so helpful to myself and all the other governors, listening to what our needs were and providing everything we need. So it’s just been going great.
Kevin Stitt: (09:54)
And so we’re one of the first states that has safely and measurably reopened. We we went to phase three on June 1st. So we’re 56 days into our reopening plan. And currently we have under 200 people in the hospital across the state of Oklahoma. And we had an uptick in the number of cases and so the media tries to talk about that. But we knew we were going to have an increased a little bit because we’re 56 days into reopening.
Kevin Stitt: (10:25)
But what’s interesting it’s the 18 to 35 group that we’ve seen a slight increase, but they’re the asymptomatic. And we’re testing so many more people right now than we were initially and the positive cases are still 3.8%. So we’ve seen this steady decline in the hospitalizations and we have to learn. I tell Oklahomans that COVID is in the US, it’s in Oklahoma, we have to learn how to be safe and how to have to move on.
Kevin Stitt: (10:51)
And so we were able to build capacity because the whole reason I issued 25 executive orders in Oklahoma was to build capacity in our hospitals and also the PPE. And we were able to do that and really flatten that curve, and that was our objective. And I told Oklahoma and stuff the better they do in that period of time, the quicker we can start reopening.
Donal Trump: (11:15)
Right.
Kevin Stitt: (11:15)
And that’s exactly what we’ve done. And Oklahomans are being safe and we can see it in our numbers, but we’re ready to get things back to normal and get life back to normal. So again, we can’t wait to have you in Oklahoma on Saturday.
Donal Trump: (11:25)
Great job, Kevin. Thank you. Thank you very much. Jovita, please.
Jovita Carranza: (11:33)
Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity to be [inaudible 00:11:33]. And also to be, Oh, thank you. And also to be able to visit many businesses throughout the states. I traveled to North Carolina as well as Dallas and visit with the face base and the lending community, as well as some small businesses. To feel and see, and as evidence of how PPP is actually working. Not only in the faith based, not only in the small businesses, but also the lending community. What more can we do to facilitate more capital for the small businesses?
Jovita Carranza: (12:05)
The underserved communities are also being sought after. We’ve asked the lenders, the very diverse lenders that we’ve signed up over 5,400 of them, to provide outreach, very aggressive outreach to our inner cities and underserved communities. I’ve spoken with some of the governors, I’ve spoken with the mayors as well, that we need to do more. There’s over a $100,000,000,000 dollars available remaining in the PPP program, a very successful program.
Jovita Carranza: (12:32)
You’ve shared, Lori how you’ve been able to transition your business from a very high end to a takeout and still maintain the customer base. And we’re realizing this, Mr. President, throughout the States and every state that we visit.
Jovita Carranza: (12:48)
Now, the fact that SBA has been able to have a touch point of over 10 million small businesses. We have 50 million that you indicated of employees in one portfolio-
Donal Trump: (12:59)
Right.
Jovita Carranza: (13:00)
… and another about 9 million in the other portfolio. So at some point we will be providing technical assistance, providing some coaching and counseling to be able to solidify those relationships that the new businesses have developed with the lending community. So I thank you President for your support.
Donal Trump: (13:20)
And thank you very much. And you know they’ve done more business in four days than they did in four years. It’s become a big business. Small business is now big business. So thank you.
Jovita Carranza: (13:30)
Thank you.
Donal Trump: (13:30)
Doing a great job. Thank you very much. Steve, please.
Steve Minuchin: (13:34)
Mr. President, thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here and it’s great to see your economic programs working, especially for small businesses. The PPP has been a tremendous success, we’ve seen that in the employment numbers. We still have more work to do. We want to make sure that every single person who lost their job because of COVID gets back to work, and we won’t be done until that happens. And I’m also pleased that this week working with the Federal Reserve, we’ve opened the Main Street Funding Facility. Again, that will be accessible to small businesses down to $250,000 loans. So again, a massive amount of liquidity that’s been pumped into the system for small businesses.
Donal Trump: (14:15)
Thank you. Larry, how are we doing today?
Larry Kudlow: (14:19)
Well, weekly unemployment claims fell for the 11th straight week. It’s a good sign, what kind of job numbers in June and I think will be very strong. I agree with Steven, I think the rescue plan worked. I think the PPE was superhuman, probably saved 55 million jobs. And we saw that with a 3 million job increase in the main numbers.
Larry Kudlow: (14:43)
I compile my list of green shoots sir. We’ve got Apple mobility for traveling almost back to it’s pre- pandemic high. Home builder demand. And competence is very, very strong. Automobiles, car sales are moving from 8.6 million to 12.2 million as the factories reopen. As you noted, the retail sales number was a spectacular 18%. Michigan consumer expectations, very strong today and FIB optimism index expect economy to improve a record a jump. Expect economy to improve a record jump. And manufacturing, the Philly Fed and the New York Fed Future Activity indexes off the charts.
Larry Kudlow: (15:33)
If I play reference to the congressional budget office, if we get a 20% increase in Q3, which I think is quite possible, a 20% increase in Q4 and a 5% increase in Q one 2021, we will be back to where we were in 2019. We will have made up for the lost ground.
Donal Trump: (15:56)
Amazing.
Larry Kudlow: (15:57)
It’s not going to take five years.
Donal Trump: (15:59)
That’s amazing
Larry Kudlow: (15:59)
We will have made it up with some decent numbers by the first quarter of 2021.
Larry Kudlow: (16:03)
It up with some decent numbers by the first quarter of 2021.
Donald Trump: (16:04)
That’s called the Super V, right?
Larry Kudlow: (16:06)
Super V. I like the I scenario.
Donald Trump: (16:09)
It’s called the V plus. Well, that’s where we’re headed. But we were headed to great things and then we got hit by the Chinese plague. So that happens too. And things happen that you don’t expect sometimes. But we built it once, we’re now building it again and it’s going to be even more successful in my opinion. Kayleigh, please.
Kayleigh: (16:32)
Yes Mr. President. I would just note that the V is indeed an I and you’ve described this economy like a rocket ship previously. And I think the numbers you laid out are worth reemphasizing because it’s exactly that 2.5 million jobs added blowing past expectations. You had the experts off by about 10 million jobs. That’s quite an extraordinary number to be off by. Also the DAO, above 26,000 points. You mentioned the NASDAQ setting the record. Seven million jobs, 9,000 opportunity zones. You’re the jobs’ president. You did this once. You brought seven million jobs and quite clearly what the markets are saying is they have faith that you are the jobs’ president that will do this again.
Donald Trump: (17:13)
So most people have never built a positive economy. We’re going to do it twice and the second time it’s going to be better than the first. I think Steve, we have a shot at it, right? Okay, please go ahead.
Anthony Gomez: (17:27)
Yes, I’m Anthony Gomez and I’m honored to be here Mr. President representing the State of Nebraska. We were really focused on three things in terms of making sure that our economy stayed on track and first it was stabilization. So the PPP, the [inaudible 00:17:40] loan gave us the liquidity injection that we needed to help us out. Debt servicing our community banks work very closely with the small businesses to defer payments, and then we move into recovery. And when we talk about recovery, the $1.08 billion that we’ve received from the Treasury has been a huge help. We’ve broken it down into four programs, small business stabilization, rural broadband, we’ve given a million dollars for Gallup and then we also looking at taking workers that are in industries that are shrinking and retraining them in high demand industries so we can put Nebraskans back to work in the right areas.
Donald Trump: (18:19)
When you mention rural broadband, and we’re doing that very big for the Middle West and for our farmers and that’s a very big factor and as you know, we’ve started the process already.
Anthony Gomez: (18:29)
Yes.
Donald Trump: (18:30)
And I think you’re going to be very happy with it.
Anthony Gomez: (18:32)
Absolutely.
Donald Trump: (18:32)
Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
Melissa Hegarty: (18:38)
Good afternoon Mr. President, governors, secretaries, directors, and honored guests. My name is Melissa Hegarty and I am proud and honored to be the invited guest of Governor Ricketts from the great state of Nebraska. I am a wife and mother to two young daughters ages nine and 11, as well as the co-owner of four bakeries in Nebraska and Iowa. We’ve been in business for 10 years and have approximately 92 employees. Early on in COVID-19, we decided not to lay off any employees rather ask the ones that live at home with their parents to scale back on some of their hours if they can. By doing that, it would give the other employees that needed their shifts to be able to cover their rent and other expenses and opportunity to keep their hours. Most of our employees are in their early twenties with no families to fall back on so it was critical for us to take care of them any way we could.
Melissa Hegarty: (19:31)
It was an important decision for the federal government to allow each state’s governor to decide how to formulate their own plan of how to close and in turn reopen their state. Fortunately, my businesses in both Nebraska and Iowa were able to continue to serve our guests inside the bakery while practicing social distancing, sanitizing between guests, all while everyone wears a mask. We had several terrible weeks of sales leading into Easter. It was easily the scariest time of my life as a business owner, not knowing what would happen next. We did apply for and receive Paycheck Protection Program funds through our small locally-owned bank, who we’ve had a strong relationship with since we started back in 2010. That program has been helpful for us to continue to meet our fiduciary obligations, in terms of promises to our staff as well as paying our monthly bills.
Melissa Hegarty: (20:22)
As the virus continued past Easter, we were able to increase our delivery business while adding a new service for our guests, curbside pickup. But with curbside pickup, it did come with some challenges. So increased labor would be probably the biggest effect on our bottom-line. Additional employees have been added to answer the phones and runners are needed to take orders out to the guests waiting in their car. By mid May, sales were picking up and we did have our best Mother’s Day ever seeing double digit growth over last year’s weekly sales. So my Nebraska bakeries have now entered phase three starting this upcoming Monday of Governor Rickett’s directed health measures. We anticipate our guests desire to celebrate all of the life’s events they missed over the past three months. New babies, birthdays, anniversaries, retirements with our ultimate hope that it will transfer into a much busier summer than we normally would have. I want to thank you for inviting me to be a part of this important discussion. I’m honored.
Donald Trump: (21:22)
Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Please.
Woman: (21:34)
Thank you Mr. President. I’m honored to be here representing small independent restaurant industry and the great state of Oklahoma. Thank you for inviting me. I am a small independent restaurant owner. I own and operate Stella Modern Italian Cuisine in Oklahoma City. My restaurant celebrated 10 years in business in April. Prior to COVID-19, I employed 30 people in the restaurant. When restaurants were closed for inside dining, I was forced to furlough some very dedicated and loyal employees for the first time ever. Since I did receive the PPP financial assistance, I was able to offer all of our staff their jobs back and all but three returned. I want to thank you and Governor Stitt for working so hard for our economy and helping us reopen in a responsible and systematic way. Our industry have worked very closely with Governor Stitt and the Health Department of Oklahoma on guidelines to reopen with a phased approach.
Woman: (22:41)
It has been good to get back to work and to be able to serve our guests. Under the guidelines that we adopted in Oklahoma, we are using data-driven points to ensure we are reopening our restaurants and economy in a safe and in an efficient manner. In reopening our number one goal has been to keep our customers safe as well as our employees. We know there’s work to be done, to create a sense of confidence in our diners as well as our employees, and help people feel good about dining out again. We are diligently following all the guidelines on using PPP, I’m sorry, PPE for our employees, doubling our sanitation practice, and encouraging our customers to follow the suggested guidelines for social distancing. Restaurants have always had outstanding protocol in place for safely preparing food and serving our customers in a safe manner. As you’re aware, the restaurant industry has suffered greatly during this and unprecedented time. Our job loss and lost sales has been overwhelming. So I want to thank you for working so hard for our economy and signing into-
Woman: (24:03)
… so hard for our economy and signing into a law the CARES Act, which provides PPP forgivable loans to help our industry and our economy at large get back to work. There is more that needs to be done and we appreciate the opportunity we have to work closely with you, your administration, and our congressional leaders for next steps to get our economy and our industry back to work and fully open. President Trump, America’s restaurant industry is grateful for your leadership in guiding us through this pandemic. Thank you again for inviting me to meet with you and thank you for Governor Stitt, for your leadership in getting Oklahomans back to work.
Donald Trump: (24:48)
That’s very nice and we’re going to try and get deductions back for your restaurant industry and you can look at that man right over there. He’ll be carrying the message, but we’re looking for the deductions for entertainment restaurants and you’ll get it right back, bigger than before. Okay?
Woman: (25:02)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (25:02)
Working very hard on that, please.
Pete Patel: (25:05)
Thank you, Mr. President. Honored to represent the lodging industry before America’s first hotelier President, grateful to Governor Stitt for his leadership and for the invitation to join today. My name is Pete Patel, first generation American. My family and I immigrated to the United States in 1979 in search of the American dream. We found that American dream in Tulsa, Oklahoma as small business and hoteliers. Our company owns and operates 12 hotels in Eastern Oklahoma. The current crisis, lodging was the first to suffer because of shelter in place and we will be the last to recover. It may take up to two years. Before COVID, our industry had record occupancies, profitability and new development hotels, thanks to the exceptional strong economy under your leadership, Mr. President. Because of COVID, occupancy dropped to 20% nationally, revenues fell by 50% and 70% of all hotel employees were either laid off are furloughed. For the first time in my career, we were forced to lay off employees and that was the most gut wrenching experience that we’ve had.
Pete Patel: (26:21)
The Payroll Protection Program was a lifeline to our industry to help America’s small businesses and our employees. The best thing for our business is that our economy opens. Grateful to Oklahoma Governor for his systematic, data-driven approach to leading our state back to opening. Currently our occupancies have picked up a bit, but we still have a long ways to go as an industry as well as our market. The hospitality industry as a whole, as stated, are reopening hotels in a safe and healthy manner. The industry has implemented what’s called Safe Stay Standard, sanitization, PPE use, social distancing, things like limiting buffets and using grab and go pre-packaged items. Swimming pools and gyms are limited with appointments for use. Guests and employees are only safe as how we make the properties and the hotel industry has done a great job in adapting ways to make sure all of our employees and guests are safe.
Pete Patel: (27:41)
Mr. President, I would like to mention a couple of things. We need more states to reopen, consumers to feel safe to travel. Industry will need additional resources to help pay our bills. Increase cap on the [inaudible 00:27:58] program would be very helpful to us and we need pressure relief from our local banks who may be stressed in these times coming up, that have hospitality loans. We will need help from the Federal Reserve and FDIC on those two things. In conclusion, Mr. President, America’s hoteliers are grateful for your leadership. We appreciate, and you know what it’s like to own and operate hotels. We are looking forward to working with you towards a swift and strong recovery. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (28:35)
I’m impressed by your 20% number. If that was your low point, you’re better than any hotel company that I’ve seen. We had Hilton and they were at 1%, right? And we had all of the big ones and they were from one to four or 5%. So if you’re at 20%, congratulations, that’s pretty good.
Pete Patel: (28:53)
That was the average, Mr. President. There was a few of them that weren’t that.
Donald Trump: (28:58)
That’s great. Great job, thank you.
Brooke Rollins: (29:00)
Mr. President, thank you. As your Domestic Policy Chief, what an honor it is to have all of these small business owners here at the White House. I’m reminded that just yesterday, Mr. President, we had veterans in, the day before we were doing policing reform in the Rose Garden, the day before that we were talking about seniors and taking care of our elderly and fraud. Everything you do, every day, every minute, is how to do the most for all Americans and the small business, this is the backbone of our country. I’m from a town of 1,200 people, Glen Rose, Texas, an hour south of Dallas, raised by a single mom who had a flower shop on the main street of Glen Rose.
Brooke Rollins: (29:37)
Small business truly is the American dream at its very, very best. And the work that Secretary Mnuchin, that Administrator Carranza are doing for this country is extraordinary, but it’s executing your vision. And so bringing today, these small business owners to the White House, talking about how we’re going to not just get this country back where we were just a couple months ago before the pandemic from China hit, but to even greater heights than ever before. It’s just an honor to be here and I want to welcome and thank everyone for coming to the White House and thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership.
Donald Trump: (30:09)
Thank you for doing a great job.
Brooke Rollins: (30:10)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (30:11)
Thank you, very much. Okay, thank you all very much."
"Jun 16, 2020",Uknown,"Donald Trump: (00:27)
Thank you very much, please. And thank you all for being here as we take historic action to deliver a future of safety and security for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. We’re joined today by law enforcement professionals and community leaders. Though we may all come from different places and different backgrounds, we’re united by our desire to ensure peace and dignity and equality for all Americans. I’ve just concluded a meeting with incredible families, just incredible families that have been through so much. The families of Ahmaud Arbery, Botham Jean, Antwon Rose, Jemel Roberson, Atatiana Jefferson, Michael Dean, Darius Tarver, Cameron Lamb and Everett Palmer.
Donald Trump: (01:37)
These are incredible people, incredible people, and it’s so sad. Many of these families lost their loved ones in deadly interactions with police. To all of the hurting families I want you to know that all Americans mourn by your side, your loved ones will not have died in vain. We are one nation, we grieve together and we heal together. I can never imagine your pain or the depth of your anguish, but I can promise to fight for justice for all of our people. And I gave a commitment to all of those families today with Senator Tim Scott and Attorney General Bill Barr, we are going to pursue what we said. We will be pursuing it and we will be pursuing it strongly, Tim, right? Okay.
Donald Trump: (02:41)
I want to recognize the Attorney General Bill Barr who has spent much time on this and other matters like this. Bill, thank you very much for being here along with… great job you’re doing. Along with Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell and Tim Scott, and they’re going to be working on a Senate bill also that could go hand in hand with this. And also representatives Kelly Armstrong, Louie Gohmert, Jim Jordan, Guy Reschenthaler and Pete Stauber. And thanks also to Florida Attorney General, Ashley Moody. The President of the Fraternal Order of Police, Pat Yoes. President of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Steven Casstevens, and many other law enforcement leaders who are going to be joining me at the signing.
Donald Trump: (03:39)
Today is about pursuing common sense and fighting, fighting for a cause like we seldom get the chance to fight for, we have to find common ground. But I strongly oppose the radical and dangerous efforts to defend, dismantle and dissolve our police departments, especially now when we’ve achieved the lowest recorded crime rates in recent history. Americans know the truth, without police there is chaos, without law there is anarchy and without safety there is catastrophe. We need leaders at every level of government who have the moral clarity to state these obvious facts.
Donald Trump: (04:24)
Americans believe we must support the brave men and women in blue who police our streets and keep us safe. Americans also believe we must improve accountability, increase transparency and invest more resources in police training, recruiting and community engagement. Reducing crime and raising standards are not opposite goals, they are not mutually exclusive, they work together, they all work together. That is why today I’m signing an executive order encouraging police departments nationwide to adopt the highest professional standards to serve their communities. These standards will be as high and as strong as there is on earth.
Donald Trump: (05:14)
The vast majority of police officers are selfless and courageous public servants. They are great men and women. When others run away from danger police run straight into harm’s way often putting their lives at stake to protect someone who they don’t know or never even met. Great danger. Police officers run straight toward this incredible harm. Take the World Trade Center, they ran straight into the Twin Towers of 9/11. Many of them never returned, never returned. Vast numbers of New York’s finest never returned.
Donald Trump: (06:08)
Last year, I presented the Medal of Valor to six heroic police officers who ended a murderer’s rampage so professionally in Dayton, Ohio. Hundreds of people would have been killed surely without them. We ask our police to put on the uniform and risk their lives for us every day. The least we deserve and the least we can do because they deserve it so much, they have to get our gratitude and we have to give them great respect for what they do for their job is one of the most dangerous jobs on earth, one of the most difficult jobs on earth.
Donald Trump: (06:54)
Last year alone 89 law enforcement offices were killed in the line of duty. In recent days two members of law enforcement were killed amid riots and looting and hundreds of police offices were injured just recently. One officer was shot in the head and is now laying in a hospital almost totally paralyzed. Despite our very good record on crime, law and order must be further restored nationwide and your Federal Government is ready, willing, and able to help. As we did in Minneapolis after it got out of control for four days, we sent in representatives commonly known as the National Guard, and it was all put down very quickly. We’re willing to help, we’re willing to help in Seattle, we’re willing to help anywhere you want and we’ll be there very quickly it won’t take long.
Donald Trump: (07:58)
There will be no more looting or arson and the penalty will be very grave for those who get caught. Violence and destruction will not be tolerated, we cannot do that. The looters have no cause that they’re fighting for, it’s just trouble. Every day police officers make great sacrifices to keep our community secure and safe. In 2018 our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder, 25,000 people for rape and nearly 1.5 million for assault, very dangerous criminals. In many cases local law enforcement is underfunded, understaffed and undersupported.
Donald Trump: (08:52)
47% of all murders in Chicago and 68% of all murders in Baltimore went without arrests last year. Americans want law and order, they demand law and order. They may not say it, they may not be talking about it but that’s what they want. Some of them don’t even know that’s what they want but that’s what they want, and they understand that when you remove the police, you hurt those who have the least, the most. Nobody needs a strong, trustworthy police force more than those who live in distressed areas. And nobody is more opposed to the small number of bad police officers, and you have them. They’re very tiny, I use the word tiny. It’s a very small percentage, but you have them. But nobody wants to get rid of them more than the overwhelming number of really good and great police officers. Some of them are standing with me and with me in the audience today and I appreciate you being here. Thank you, thank you. Great job.
Donald Trump: (10:09)
What’s needed now is not more stoking of fear and division, we need to bring law enforcement and communities closer together, not to drive them apart. Under the executive order I’m signing today we will prioritize federal grants from the Department of Justice to police departments that seek independent credentialing, certifying that they meet high standards and in fact in certain cases, the highest standard. That’s where they do it the best on the use of force and deescalation training.
Donald Trump: (10:45)
For example, many believe that proper training might have prevented the tragic deaths of Antwan Rose and Botham Jean. As part of this new credentialing process chokeholds will be banned except if an officer’s life is at risk. And I will say we’ve dealt with all of the various departments and everybody said, “It’s time, we have to do it.” Additionally, we’re looking at new advanced and powerful less lethal weapons to help prevent deadly interactions. New devices are being developed all the time and we’re looking at the best of them and cost is no object, no object.
Donald Trump: (11:32)
Under this executive order departments will also need a share of information about credible abuses so that offers with significant issues do not simply move from one police department to the next, that’s a problem. And the heads of our police department said, “Whatever you can do about that please let us know.” We’re letting you know, we’re doing a lot about it. In addition, my order will direct federal funding to support officers in dealing with homeless individuals and those who have mental illness and substance abuse problems. We will provide more resources for co-responders, such as social workers who can help officers manage these complex encounters. And this is what they’ve studied and worked on all their lives, they understand how to do it. We’re going to get the best of them put in our police departments and working with our police.
Donald Trump: (12:33)
We will have reform without undermining our many great and extremely talented law enforcement officers. President Obama and Vice President Biden never even tried to fix this during their eight-year period. The reason they didn’t try is because they had no idea how to do it, and it is a complex situation. Beyond the steps we’re taking today I am committed to working with Congress on additional measures. Congress has started already and there’ll be having bills coming out of the Senate and possibly out of the House, and hopefully they’ll all get together and they’ll come up with a solution that goes even beyond what we’re signing today. But this is a big, big step that hasn’t been taken before.
Donald Trump: (13:28)
But in order to make real progress on public safety, we have to break old patterns of failure. Many of the same politicians now presenting themselves as the solution are the same ones who have failed for decades on schools, jobs, justice, and crime, they are all often. Unfortunately the same politicians running the cities and states where help is most needed. It’s an attitude and it’s not working. Today’s action is a big part of the solution to restoring, renewing and rebuilding our communities. For the last three and a half years my administration has been focused on creating opportunity, fighting for equal justice and truly delivering results. Nobody has ever delivered results like we’ve delivered, nobody’s come close.
Donald Trump: (14:35)
And we work with some great people, we work with fantastic people to get it done. We enacted landmark criminal justice reform, something that nobody else could get done. They tried and they couldn’t even come close and we got it done and we got it done powerfully and people appreciated it. But it’s something that with all the work and all the talk for so many years, criminal justice reform, nobody else could get done. We secured permanent and record funding for HBCUs, that’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Numbers that they never thought were possible and long-term financing.
Donald Trump: (15:21)
Because they would come back to the White House after my third year, I said, “Why are you here again?” Great people, about 42 people, the heads of black colleges and universities, great people. They do such an incredible job and I’d see them after the third year. I say, “Why are you doing this?” “We need money again.” I said, “Don’t we set it so you have a 10-year program, a five-year program?” “You know, sir, for years and years we’ve had to come back every single year.” I said, “Well, the only bad thing about what I’m going to do is I’m going to give you long-term financing and I’m going to up the amount, but I won’t get to see you anymore, so that’s the bad part. But you can focus on education now instead of worrying about dealing with us in Washington.” So we did that for the historically black colleges and universities. I’m very proud of it, they’re incredible people. Got to know a lot of the heads of those colleges, they do an unbelievable job and don’t get the kind of notoriety that they should have.
Donald Trump: (16:31)
We expanded affordable options for better healthcare. We created Opportunity Zones with Senator Tim Scott, brought it to me. We didn’t know if we could get it passed, Tim, right? But we got it passed and I think it’s probably one of the great things that we’ve done in this administration. Tens of thousands of jobs, billions and billions of dollars being brought into areas and neighborhoods that would never, ever, ever be taken care of monetarily, areas that didn’t have 25 cents put in them for years and decades. And now people are investing thriving and the jobs, they’ve come back.
Donald Trump: (17:12)
We achieved the lowest black, Hispanic, and Asian unemployment rates in American history and we will do it again, we’ll do it again. We’re fighting for school choice, which really is the civil rights of all time in this country. Frankly school choice is the civil rights statement of the year, of the decade and probably beyond because all children have to have access to quality education. A child’s zip code in America should never determine their future and that’s what was happening. We’re very, very strong on school choice and I hope everybody remembers that. And it’s happening, it’s already happened, but it’s happening. We have tremendous opposition from people that know they shouldn’t be opposing it, school choice. All children deserve equal opportunity because we are all made equal by God, so true.
Donald Trump: (18:11)
A great jobs market and thriving economy is probably the best thing that we can do to help the black, Hispanic, Asian communities. We saw that just recently prior to the virus that came in from China just a few months ago, what a horrible thing it was all over the world, 188 countries now. And I just want to say we’ve done incredibly well, we’re doing well. Things are happening that nobody can even believe. Our country is opening up and it’s opening up rapidly. We had the best unemployment and employment numbers, think of that. In the history of our country we’re up to almost 160 million people working, there was never anything even close. And that’s for almost every group, including black, Hispanic, Asian, women, young people, old people, young people without a high school diploma, every group.
Donald Trump: (19:24)
Everybody was thrilled, everybody had just about high paying jobs. Our country was never in a better position and we were planning on massive growth, it was happening, it was already there. Including big salary increases which were already taking place for the last two and a half years. Big, big increases, record increases, nobody’s seen anything like it. And then we got hit by the virus along with the rest of the world and now I’m building it up again. Here we go again, but I’m building it up again and it’s moving fast and it will be even better than before because we also learned. It will be better than before.
Donald Trump: (20:10)
Jobs are rapidly coming back and retail sales that were just announced two hours ago, just a little while ago, they’re up a staggering 17.7%. Amazing. The projection was anywhere from six to 8%, we’re up 17.7%. And what does that mean? The stock market went through the roof. These good numbers they drove it up to a level that we’re almost at the same level, hard to believe, we’re getting very close to the level we were before the pandemic and before all of the things that you’ve seen happen, happen. That’s a great thing because ultimately it’s about jobs, it’s about, the government can never do anything like a great job for a person where they look forward to getting up in the morning and going to work and getting a much bigger check than they could ever get otherwise.
Donald Trump: (21:13)
Today and over the last 60 days we’ve had one of the biggest stock market increases in the history of the stock markets. And two weeks ago, the 50-day increase was the single biggest. Unless my formula is tampered with we will soon be in a stronger position than we were before the plague came in from China. When the numbers reached the point that I know they will, there will again be a great unity and a great spirit in our country. People will have that job back that they might’ve lost.
Donald Trump: (21:54)
There’ll be making even more money than they did before. We have some brilliant people working with me and we put it together. We did it once and we’re very easily doing it again, we’re way ahead of schedule, you’ll see that. You’ll see the third quarter numbers will be very good. You’ll see fourth quarter will be really good and you’ll see next year will be one of the best economic years this country has ever had. And it’s all happening very quickly way ahead of schedule and I think you’ll see that people can’t even believe what they’re looking at.
Donald Trump: (22:31)
But on top of all of that before the end of the year I predict we will have a very successful vaccine, therapeutic and cure. We’re making tremendous progress. I deal with these credible scientists, doctors very, very closely. I have great respect for their minds and they have come up with things and they’ve come up with many other cures and therapeutics over the years. These are the people, the best, the smartest, the most brilliant anywhere. And they’ve come up with the AIDS vaccine, they’ve come up with… or the AIDS and as you know there’s various things and now various companies are involved….but the therapeutic for AIDS, AIDS was a death sentence and now people live a life with a pill, it’s an incredible thing.
Donald Trump: (23:28)
The Ebola vaccine and others, these are the people that have done it, or these are the people that have been around it and they’re all competing, it’s an incredible thing. All of these brilliant firms, labs, companies are competing and I will tell you we’re very far advanced. We’ve already started tests and trials, so I think we’re going to have a very, very good answer to that very, very soon. I always say even without it, it goes away. But if we had the vaccine and we will, if we had therapeutic or cure, one thing, sort of blends into the other, it will be a fantastic day. And I think that’s going to happen and it’s going to happen very soon.
Donald Trump: (24:16)
Americans can achieve anything when we work together as one national family. To go forward we must seek cooperation not confrontation. We must build upon our heritage, not tear it down. And we must cherish the principles of America’s founding as we strive to deliver safe, beautiful, elegant justice and liberty for all. I’d like now to invite our great friends, because they are a great friends from law enforcement. The officers representing their groups to come up as I sign a very important executive order. And we’re asking Mitch and Tim and all of the people that are here from Congress to go back and see if they can get something done.
Donald Trump: (25:12)
I see Louie and Jim Jordan. We’re all here, a lot of our representatives in Congress and the Senate. If they can go back and add to what we’re signing today it’ll be a big moment, it will be a big moment. But this is a tremendous step. This is a step that could have been taken years ago but people chose not to do that and that was, in my opinion a big mistake. It could have solved a lot of the problems that we have now. If I could, law enforcement if you could come forward. We’ve had the… please come up.
Donald Trump: (25:46)
We’ve had the endorsement of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, International Association of Chiefs of Police, International Union of Police Associations. Major County Sheriffs of America Association, National Association of Police Organizations, National District Attorneys Association, National Sheriffs Association, Sergeants Benevolent Association, and many others. They’ve worked on this with me and my team and it’s been fantastic. I want to thank my team, what a team it is. And we’ve taken very much into mind what they are saying because these are the people that keep us safe and they’ve done an incredible job. Thank you all very much, Thank you.
Donald Trump: (27:54)
Thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much, thank you."
"Jun 15, 2020","29, 2020
4:54 P.M. EDT","Donald Trump: (00:00)
… Alex Azar, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Ben Carson, who by the way, was fantastic over the weekend in various interviews you did Ben. Really good job. I appreciate it. Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Robert Wilkie, Administrator, Seema Verma, Chief Postal Inspector of the United States Postal Inspection Service, Gary Barksdale. Gary’s done a great job, especially with spotting drugs coming into our country. He’s done a fantastic job. My administration is working tirelessly to stop the depraved criminals who seek to defraud American seniors of which there are many, but we are doing a very strong number on a lot of them and nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. Three months ago, we launched the National Elder Fraud Hotline, which has already received over 1,800 calls. In three years, we’ve charged nearly 1,000 defendants involving over $2.2 billion in fraud against our seniors. This afternoon, the DOJ is announcing a $2 million grant to help new law enforcement identify victims and bring lawbreakers to justice.
Donald Trump: (01:12)
These actions are just one part of our unwavering devotion to our senior citizens. Last month, I announced a deal to slash out-of-pocket costs. You have the out-of-pocket costs of insulin and insulin’s such a big deal and such a big factor of importance for our senior citizens. And we slashed costs for hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries. Impacted seniors will pay just $35 a month, an average saving of 66 to 100%. It was the biggest slashing of insulin. Nobody’s ever done it before. And we think we can even go further. We’re working on one. Call it a trap because you have a lot of different traps that get put in your way so that you can’t do these things, but we did it. And we think we’re even going to be able to go further. So we have $35 a month.
Donald Trump: (02:03)
We vastly expanded Medicare telehealth services. That’s gone up probably more than any other thing. That’s the only thing, it’s probably the only thing you can say about COVID. Because of COVID, telehealth has been used at levels that nobody ever thought even possible. And it’s been fantastic. And I think a lot of people are going to continue to use it. Average basic Part D premiums have dropped 13.5% and average Medicare Advantage premiums have dropped 27%. And as you know, last year was the first year where drug prices in 52 years where drug prices have actually gone down, the cost of prescription drugs. We’re strongly defending Medicare and Social Security, and we always will. We’ll always protect our senior citizens and everybody against preexisting conditions. My administration is also taking vital action to protect seniors in nursing homes. We delivered $81 million for increased inspections and provided every Medicare certified nursing home with shipments of personal protective equipment.
Donald Trump: (03:11)
We are working very, very hard with the governors of the states on their nursing homes, because obviously that was a very sad situation what happened to some of the states where they didn’t do a good job with respect to nursing homes. They were caught unaware. They were caught unaware, unfortunately. So we’re working very hard with the governors and with everybody having to do with nursing homes because it’s a vulnerability. It’s a real soft spot in terms of the COVID or any one of the 15 names you want to call it. There are plenty of them out there. Well, we know it came from China. That’s all we know. We now require nursing homes to report the coronavirus cases directly to CDC, residents, and family members, all family members. We’re working with extreme vigilance to protect nursing home residents from the virus. And as I said, that’s been a very important thing for us to be doing, everybody working with the governors on that.
Donald Trump: (04:13)
My administration will never waiver in our relentless commitment to keep America’s seniors safe. We have to keep all of our seniors safe, and this is a very perilous time. And I think we’re going to be finishing up. I think we’re going to, Mike has some very good numbers to tell you about having to do with the cases. Again, our testing is so far advanced. It’s so much bigger and better than any other country that we’re going to have more cases. We’re always going to have more cases. And as I said this morning, that’s probably the downside of having good testing is you find a lot of cases that other countries who don’t even test don’t have. If you don’t test, you don’t have any cases. If we stop testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any. But we do. We’re at a level that Mike is going to talk about that’s so high, but we will show more cases when other countries have far more cases than we do. They just don’t talk about it.
Donald Trump: (05:10)
But the testing on the other hand is very good because we find out where it’s going, how it’s going, who it’s going to, and we take care of it. So with that, I’ll just say that we are fighting for American seniors. Like no administration has ever fought. We’re doing a great job in bringing down costs. We have other things like transparency that are going to be coming online in January, February, which will be an incredible thing. Nobody thought we could even get that approved, but we think we will see numbers there that will be incredible in terms of cost reduction for our seniors. So that’s very good. And Mike Pence, if you would please.
Mike Pence: (05:48)
Thank you Mr. President. And it’s a privilege to sit with you and be able to reflect on this day on the efforts this administration has made over the last three and a half years to protect our seniors, make sure they’re financially secure, and also see to the health and wellbeing of our senior citizens. From the time you tapped me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we knew that seniors with serious underlying health conditions represented the most vulnerable to serious outcomes from the coronavirus. It was the reason why early on, at your direction Mr. President, we raised the infectious disease standards at every nursing home in America, and we deployed all 8,000 of our inspectors across the country to focus exclusively on infectious diseases. And in addition to all the measures that you just reflected on, delivering personal protective equipment to the more than 15,000 nursing homes, dramatically expanding telehealth, we’ve continued to work closely with governors to focus on longterm care in nursing homes and our seniors. People across the country have looked after family members who are senior citizens with vulnerable conditions. And we urge them to continue to do that even as we have made steady progress each and every day toward putting the coronavirus farther and farther in the past. Mr. President, there’s been much reported in the news as you reflected about increased cases in some states. Our team has been working with governors over the past week. We’re carefully analyzing those new cases and we really believe that the vast majority of new cases is a reflection, as you said, of a dramatic increase in testing. Governor Newsom in California told me that on Saturday alone, California performed 78,000 tests all across the state. And yet in the state of California, their hospitalization numbers remain flat. Their positivity numbers remain flat. And in those areas where, just a few states where we’re seeing positive rates go up, we’ll be talking to governors today in states like Georgia and Arizona and Texas about deploying additional CDC personnel to help them identify where those outbreaks are occurring and how we can mitigate those efforts.
Mike Pence: (08:15)
But because of what the American people did over those 45 days to slow the spread, Mr. President, each and every day, we are demonstrating that we can safely reopen. All 50 states and our territories are now opening up America again. But as the theme of this conversation is, it’s important that we continue to focus resources on those that are vulnerable. Even while we see overall across the country cases going down, hospitalizations going down, and most importantly our mortality rate is going down all across America. Now we’re going to continue to focus with our governors on making sure that we deploy testing to our longterm care facilities and to our nursing homes. We’ll be speaking with all the nation’s governors in just a short while today, Mr. President, to continue that effort. Because we’re going to put the interest of all of America first, but as we move into this next stage and through the summer, putting the Corona virus in the past each and every day, we’re going to focus on ensuring that our seniors and all of those most vulnerable are protected.
Donald Trump: (09:27)
Thank you, Mike, very much. Great job. Bill, please.
Bill Barr: (09:31)
Thank you, Mr. President, for convening this session and for your commitment to protecting America’s elder citizens. We have made combating fraud against elders one of the department’s highest priorities. And that’s partly because we’ve seen a skyrocketing of fraud against elders as we’ve seen the conjunction of a growing older population coupled with new technology, particularly the internet, which has given fraudsters new opportunities for their schemes. And it’s a priority also because the elder population are particularly vulnerable because if they lose their savings, they don’t have much time to regain their footing. So it’s frequently a permanent loss for them. And so we have appointed a senior department official to be a full time coordinator across the entire department. This has been going on for the last couple of years. And we have in every single one of our 93 US Attorney’s Offices, a coordinator focused exclusively on rooting out fraud against elders.
Bill Barr: (10:46)
Senior citizens lose billions of dollars each year. It averages for an individual $34,000 when they fall victim to a fraudulent scheme. And we have found that many of the perpetrators and in fact frequently the brains behind these schemes are actually outside the United States and part of transnational criminal organizations. There are three things I’d like to highlight today. The first, this month marks the one year anniversary of our Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force. When we started seeing the signs of the international organizations involved in this, we decided we had to run up the chain and try to go to the source of this fraud, as well as combating it at the local level. And we set up this group to do that. And over the past year, we’ve made a lot of progress in dismantling the infrastructure of these organizations, much of it involving the use of fraudulent robocalling.
Bill Barr: (11:51)
In January, we brought landmark civil actions to shut down some of the largest carriers of fraudulent robocalls. In fact, we were able to shut down two of the five entities that are responsible for the robocalls in the United States. Just one of these, to give you an example of the scale of these companies, carried 720 million calls during a 23 day period, reaching every state in the union. After these cases, we saw a sharp decline in robocalls to consumers. So stopping this wave of robocalls by going after these international organizations is a key part of our strategy and we’re also gaining some success. At the same time, we’ve cracked down on the network of financial operatives that are frequently called money mules, who take money from seniors and send it back to their bosses overseas. The Postal Service has been instrumental in this success and Chief Postal Inspector Gary Barksdale is here to describe its efforts in more detail. But we’re proud of all the Strike Force has accomplished in the first year, but we are in a sense just getting started.
Bill Barr: (13:05)
Second, I’ve asked the FBI and every US Attorney’s Office in the United States to prioritize elder fraud cases. And each year for the past three years, we’ve had a sweep across the nation targeting these fraudsters. This year, we indicted 400 fraudsters for causing over one billion in losses to elders. And we’re not letting up. We know that the fraudsters have gained new opportunities with COVID-19. And so we have also bearing down on COVID-19 fraud schemes. The third thing is, as the president mentioned, that we’ve set up a dedicated elder fraud hotline. It’s like a 911 call for elder fraud. It’s staffed seven days a week, and we help the victims when they call get the resources they need to deal with the fraud. One of the things we found is that frequently our senior citizens are afraid to report or hesitant to report fraud because they feel that they have failed and they’re embarrassed that they were taken advantage of. So everything we can do to encourage them to report is very important in getting after these criminals. And finally, as the president mentioned, we are making grants to The National White Collar Crime Center, which will enable that group to work with local police departments, local law enforcement to develop training and tools to combat elder fraud. So this is the day to day work that’s being done at the local level. I was once used as a lure shortly before the president appointed me as Attorney General. My official government image from the last time I was Attorney General was being used to attract elders to a website. If they sent money, then I would help them get grants. And I’d get these very pathetic calls into my office of people who’ve lost everything. And they said, “I feel so stupid. We’ve lost everything.” And they just didn’t know how to call. And I called the sheriff and he wasn’t sure what to do. These are frequently people living in rural areas. And so at the local level, it’s important to train local law enforcement as to how to respond to these kinds of sophisticated frauds that are coming in from these foreign organizations. So with that, Mr. President, once again, thanks for convening this session and all you do to keep America’s seniors safe.
Donald Trump: (15:55)
Thank you, Bill. Great job. Appreciate it.
Bill Barr: (15:57)
Hey Gary, go ahead please.
Gary Barksdale: (15:59)
Thank you, Mr. President, Vice President Pence. It’s a pleasure to be here today to speak about some of the work that we’re doing at the Postal Inspection Service to address transnational elder fraud. Protecting our elders and our veterans is one of the highest priorities of our mail fraud program. Especially now, as we start to see fraudsters take advantage of the coronavirus theme to incorporate that into some of their schemes. As Attorney General Barr mentioned, one of our key strategies is to attack the money mules. As he said, the money mules is really how the fraudsters get the money from the US to their overseas accounts. Victims typically send money through the mail or other similar carriers like FedEx and UPS. Sometime they ask the victims to wire transfer the money. And oftentimes we see them asking them to buy gift cards and send it to the money mules. The money mules in turn then send the money overseas. So we see the money mules as a crucial link to disrupt if we want to be effective in this type of fraud.
Gary Barksdale: (16:57)
We’ve had some significant enforcement efforts. We also have some prevention efforts and some private sector engagement. One of our primary strategies, the center of our primary strategy is we partnered with the Department of Justice, as Attorney General Barr mentioned, the Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force. We’ve embedded postal inspectors at the Department to work hand in hand with trial attorneys to bring some of these cases to justice. We have 17 field divisions who I’ve asked to collaborate with the 93 US Attorney’s Offices and they’re elder justice coordinators on the elder fraud investigations. And we’ve conducted significant enforcement efforts this past year dealing with the money mules. Just some other stats, we’ve initiated this year over a hundred investigations.
Gary Barksdale: (17:41)
These cases are associated with nearly $450 million in victim losses. We’ve also served over 2,000 unlicensed money transmitter warning letters to suspects and working with the Department of Justice issued 34 civil injunctions. 17 arrests from those cases. We’ve also seized over $650,000. Also, as the Attorney General mentioned, the annual money mule initiative that we work in coordination with the FBI, HSI, the Secret Service, among our other financial partners. In addition to the four indictments he mentioned, law enforcement halted the conduct of more than 600 money mules. So in cases where we didn’t arrest, we served them letters or put them on notice to stop the bad action. Another example of recent success, in November of this past year, a Jamaican national sentenced to over four years in federal prison and ordered to pay over a half million dollars in restitution to elderly lottery scam victims. We’re also holding accountable the money service providers for their role in helping send fraud victim’s funds overseas, companies like Western Union and MoneyGram. Working with the Department of Justice, we’ve had access for a settlement well over a hundred million dollars. Our goal here, Mr. President, is really to try to get some of the money back to the victims. Since March of 2020, working with DOJ and our other federal partners, we’ve returned over $150 million to victims, which was over 109 fraud victims.
Gary Barksdale: (19:16)
Prevention is a big part of our strategy. Obviously we would rather educate, prevent a crime before actually a crime occurs. So we’ve put a lot of resources in coming up with a platform. You can go to our website, we have printed material, and we’re starting to utilize social media working with the Department of Justice. And I’ll just mentioned briefly the last thing I’ll just mention, Mr. President, it’s also we’re engaging the large banks to update their practices and to do their part in preventing elder fraud. I’d like to thank you for providing awareness and making this one of the priorities of the administration. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (19:50)
Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you. Robert, please.
Robert Wilkie: (19:54)
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. This is an important meeting for us at VA, but it comes on the heels of…
Robert Wilkie: (20:03)
I think for us at VA, but it comes on the heels of almost two years of constant reform that we’ve had at the department. We serve a unique population that has performed unique services to America. And I’m happy to report to the President that our approval ratings at VA are almost 40 points higher than they were in 2014 and 2016. As a result of that-
Donald Trump: (20:26)
Did you get that number, everybody? It’s a big difference.
Robert Wilkie: (20:31)
90.1%. We have seen millions of Americans flock to VA. Last year, we set a record for the number of internal appointments at VA, 59.9 million. That is an all time high. The reason that is important is that so many veterans have been trusted us with their lives, and also with the wellbeing of their families. We have 134 nursing homes in the Department of Veterans Affairs, 7,500 patients, over half of those come from World War II in Korea. We have, as we speak, only four of those 7,500 who have tested positive for the COVID virus.
Robert Wilkie: (21:15)
One of the reasons those numbers are so low is that the decision that the President made when we discussed what to do that first week of March, we had to make a drastic decision to cut off these deserving veterans, primarily from Korea in World War II, and the sustenance of their families in order to protect them. We tested them, we tested our employees, and we were able to cut them off from the most baleful effects of this virus. But in addition to those preventive measures, we were able to produce for the entire country, on March, 17th, guidance on how to protect America’s most vulnerable citizens, but that’s only part of what the President has entrusted us with doing.
Robert Wilkie: (22:03)
I am the son of a grievously wounded combat soldier from Vietnam. The President gave me instructions to make sure that the last of the circles left over from that conflict are closed, and this fall, we will finally start providing sustenance, financial and material, to the families of those veterans from Vietnam, who care for those veterans. So all of the mistakes made 50, 40 years ago, we will finally rectify.
Robert Wilkie: (22:34)
The last thing I will say is that VA has reached a milestone, not only in terms of trust, but also in providing the country with assistance in terms of helping our most vulnerable citizens. As we speak, we are in 48 States right now, in hundreds of nursing homes, providing nurses, gerontologists. We’ve taken over the management of several State veterans homes in order to protect our most vulnerable veterans. And we’ve done it with our employees who have gone in harm’s way without any question, when it comes to their own safety, helping the most deserving of Americans.
Robert Wilkie: (23:18)
And to finally say our numbers, we serve nine and a half million veterans in VA. We have 14,000 veterans who have come down with the virus, but of those 14, 000, 12,000, almost 12,000, are fully recovered. And then our nursing homes, again, of the 7,500, only four tested positive for the virus. I cannot thank the President for his support. I cannot thank our employees at VA for their heroic action. We are on the front lines when it comes to bolstering the lives of the most deserving Americans, those who have carried our freedom on their shoulders. So mr. President, I thank you for everything you’ve done for America’s [inaudible 00:24:01].
Donald Trump: (24:01)
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Alex, please.
Alex Azar: (24:04)
Well, Mr. President, thank you for what you’ve done throughout your administration to protect older Americans, and to help them live longer, healthier, more active lives. Before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, your administration had already put a major focus on keeping our older Americans healthy and safe, and that focus has continued during the current pandemic. During this crisis, thanks to new funding secured by the President, HHS’s administration for community living has pushed out more than a billion dollars for services for our older Americans that they need to stay comfortably in their homes. That’s more than a 50% boost in the annual support that we provide for community organizations that provide services like delivered meals, help with trips to the grocery store, to the doctor, and assistance with chores at home.
Alex Azar: (24:55)
We’re also making it a top priority to protect older Americans from a public health perspective. We’ve required States to put a significant focus on older Americans and nursing homes in all of their COVID-19 work, especially the state testing plans that they’ve now submitted. And we’re working very closely with the States to make sure that that’s the case. We’ve deployed CDC, experts and members of the public health service commission corps to prevent and respond to outbreaks in our nursing homes. We also know that isolation due to extended stay at home orders can make some older Americans more susceptible to the types of abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation that we’re talking about today.
Alex Azar: (25:35)
This past week, I addressed that topic as part of a meeting of the Elder Justice Coordinating Council, which I chair as HHS secretary. Last week, we added the Department of Homeland Security to the EJCC as the 15th member agency, reflecting the President’s commitment to protecting our seniors from abuse. In 2018, we made a focused effort to expand the work of EJCC and dedicate funding to prevent and combat abuse of our older Americans, that results from our country’s opioid crisis. Through the work of agencies across the Trump administration, we’ve made great progress in strengthening and improving our federal response to older American maltreatment in recent years.
Alex Azar: (26:15)
Under President Trump, in 2018, all 50 States began participating for the first time in the National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System, which produces data that’s been widely acknowledged as necessary to drive action and implement reforms. In March when the Justice Department announced its national nursing home initiative, Attorney General Barr was joined by our Assistant Secretary for Aging, Lance Robertson.
Alex Azar: (26:40)
We haven’t pulled back on our efforts to protect older Americans during the COVID-19 crisis, despite the additional challenges. For instance, we support State longterm care ombudsmen who help older Americans who encounter issues in nursing homes and assisted living facilities resolving more than 138,000 issues just last year. During the pandemic ombudsmen have been adding virtual walkthroughs where nursing home staff walked through the room to room throughout the facility with a tablet, and allow residents the opportunity to meet virtually with their ombudsman.
Alex Azar: (27:13)
Finally, I want to emphasize the overall success we’ve seen with increased access and lower costs for older Americans who need prescription drugs. According to data from Labor Department’s Bureau of labor statistics, prescription drug price inflation has essentially been flat since President Trump announced his drug pricing blueprint from June, 2018 to April, 2020, after averaging 4% growth per year for the previous five years. That’s a tribute to efforts across the administration, including record-breaking generic drug approvals in each of the last three years at FDA.
Alex Azar: (27:48)
Lower prescription drug costs more support for older Americans in the community, better protection and nursing homes and assisted living facilities, all of these steps mean more healthy, prosperous years for older Americans to spend with their loved ones. And that’s what President Trump has promised older Americans, and that’s what he’s delivered. Thank you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (28:06)
Thank you Alex, very much. Good job. Ben.
Ben Carson: (28:09)
All right. Well, thank you Mr. President, for all the work you’ve been doing to get our country back on track, and America owes a lot to our seniors. They’re the ones who really built this country up, they’re the ones who’ve made this nation a destination for people from around the world, and they are wonderful fountains of knowledge that live among us. And I’m proud to be a part of an administration that really values our elderly citizens.
Ben Carson: (28:42)
Mr. President, you promised not to forget men and women of our nation, to put special emphasis on them, and that’s been the case with a lot of the elderly over the course of time. And at HUD, our housing choice voucher program, provides rental subsidies for 4.7 million families, low income families, including elderly and disabled who make up more than 50% of the voucher holders. The Cares Act has provided an additional $3 billion for this program so that we can assure any senior who needs help, that they will receive assistance.
Ben Carson: (29:26)
Our section 202 Program, another area that prioritizes the elderly and housing, providing low income elders with options, which allow them to continue to live independently, and supportive services such as cooking, cleaning, transportation, all of these things we’re making sure to provide quality of life for these individuals. Cares Act provided $50 million and additional funding for this program to cover a lot of the expenses that were unforeseen before the COVID-19 crisis hit us.
Ben Carson: (30:10)
Some of HUD’s other programs include Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program, which over the last three years has undergone substantial improvements, particularly under the guidance of our now Deputy Secretary Bryant Montgomery, and this really allows seniors to age in place, and utilize their equity that they’ve accumulated over the years. And since its inception, FHA has insured more than a million reverse mortgages.
Ben Carson: (30:43)
Our Public Housing Authorities assist our low income Americans, including seniors, in finding quality affordable housing. And HUD also has a portfolio of hospitals that we ensure, that obviously, provide significant services to seniors across the country. Those are just a few of the efforts that we’ve taken to help those who’ve given so much over the years to this nation, as a compassionate society, we have an obligation to take care of the most vulnerable citizens. And they’re also very valuable citizens. Without them this nation would not be where it is today, and I’m proud to work alongside you, Mr. President, and the other sitting here and this whole administration, which really does value our senior citizens. And we’re grateful for the wisdom that our seniors share with us every day.
Donald Trump: (31:49)
Thank you very, very much. Excellent. Seema, please.
Seema Verma: (31:53)
Thank you. From day one, the President has made his commitment to the Medicare program absolutely clear, and like few presidents before him, he’s always understood the pressing need to modernize the program and also make it more affordable for seniors. He just talked about how premiums are lower in the Medicare advantage program, we’re at a 13 year low, and in the Part D Program, which is prescription drug coverage that’s at a seven year low, which is absolutely historic. We’re putting dollars back in the pockets of our seniors.
Seema Verma: (32:23)
Also, he talked about not only the fact that we’re lowering prices, we’re actually adding more benefits to our Medicare advantage plans. We changed the regulations to give our plans more flexibility, to provide services that will keep seniors in their homes and more independent and healthy. So that could be something like just putting a handlebar in their home to help them get up the stairs, it could be meal services after surgery, it could be pestering eradication services, but giving our seniors more services at a lower cost.
Seema Verma: (32:53)
You also heard the President talk about the insulin program, $35 for insulin going forward. I had an opportunity to travel with the Vice President last week, and we ran into a gentleman at Dave’s Diner in Pennsylvania, and he came up to us, he showed us his insulin, and he said, “I need this for my survival. And because of the President’s leadership,” he said, “I’m going to save $5,000 a year.” So he was really excited, and I think that shows how much the President has delivered to our seniors.
Seema Verma: (33:24)
But our work also goes beyond just the Medicare Program, and we are working to ensure that our seniors are safe in nursing homes because of the President’s early action with nursing homes in terms of restricting visitors, and also making sure that our nursing homes were supported with recommendations around infection control, 80% of our nursing homes across the country have actually done pretty well. They haven’t seen any cases of coronavirus or any deaths.
Seema Verma: (33:52)
That being said, we are focused on the 20% of nursing homes, we’ve been working with governors, asking them to test nursing home residents and their staff, and to do that routinely so we can ensure that our nursing home residents are safe. And we’re encouraging governors to go out to these nursing homes and perform inspections, boots on the ground so that we can ensure that those nursing homes are taking the proper precautions. And then finally, the President has also convened a commission on coronavirus for nursing homes to ensure that we are delivering quality and safety to our nursing home residents. So thank you Mr. President for your leadership.
Donald Trump: (34:31)
Thank you. Good job. Kellyann, please.
Kellyanne Conway: (34:34)
Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Vice president. Mr. President, we heard you many times, four or five years ago, saying that if we don’t take care of our veterans, if we don’t take care of our seniors, who are we as a nation, and you promise then, and have delivered now many times to protect their entitlements, to preserve, to protect Social Security and Medicare. But our seniors are also entitled to dignity, to safety, to the presence of mind and the peace of mind of knowing that their financial assets are protected from money mules, and from those who would lore and lurk among them.
Kellyanne Conway: (35:08)
All of the great work that’s been done in trying to solve this global pandemic, including for our seniors, has also left them vulnerable in a different way, they’re away from family members. Many of them are in their homes, taking advantage of the great work that our health and economic teams have been doing for them, and our justice teams, but they also are bigger, brighter prey for many of these predators. And so we want to make sure that that physical abuse we saw in a videotape a couple of weeks ago, a person or persons being abused in a nursing home by an errant individual, a criminal individual, that we all know that we shine a light on that, but also these financial crimes are very serious. So thank you for all you’re doing in that regard.
Kellyanne Conway: (35:55)
I just, since so much has been said by the [inaudible 00:35:59] members around the table, I’ll end with this. It’s really a message for the media. I know many of you don’t like being told that you are guilty of bias coverage, but don’t be guilty of incomplete coverage. Today is World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, there is a board behind me and one over there. You choose every single day, every single moment, what message to tweet, what news to report, what story to tell, please include this in your reporting. It is important. It is World Elder Abuse Awareness day for a reason, and you can help us with that awareness. Be a resource, be a friend to America’s seniors today, if not seniors internationally by letting them know there are tools at their disposal and we are here to help solve these problems. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (36:44)
Thank you very much. Good job. So we’re taking care of our senior citizens better than ever before. There’s never been this much effort, there has never been this much money spent. We’re taking good care of them, and thank you all very much. Thank you.
John: (37:02)
[inaudible 00:37:02] on your executive order tomorrow, can you tell us sort of the broad brush strokes of police use of force reform as well as enhancing opportunities for communities across the country.
Donald Trump: (37:13)
I’m going to save it for tomorrow, John, but basically we’re going to be talking about things that we’ve been watching and seeing for the last month. And we’re going to have some solutions, I think some good solutions. And some of it is it’s about great people. We need great people in our police departments, and we have mostly great people, I would say that. I would say that with certainty, we have mostly great people. I know so many of them in law enforcement, but we will do better, even better. And we’re going to try and do it fast.
Donald Trump: (37:43)
So we’re going to have a meeting tomorrow, we’re going to have a news conference tomorrow. We have a lot of law enforcement coming in and others, and they have seen what we’re doing. I’ve sent it around. I’ve asked for suggestions from different groups, in particular the Sheriff’s, and I’ve sent it to our Attorney General. And I think Bill, you’ve gone to some of your people with it and shown it. I think it’s pretty comprehensive.
Donald Trump: (38:10)
As you know, Congress is also working on it, the Senate’s working on something, and the house is working on two elements of the house, you have the Republicans and the Democrats, and they’re each working on their own, but we can get it done, and we’ll get it done, and certainly we can add onto what we do by the work that’s being done in the house, and in the Senate. If we think it’s appropriate, maybe they can get something passed and maybe they can’t, but we will get it passed and it’s got to be passed by one person and the person’s me. So we’re going to be signing it tomorrow. And we’ll have a news conference at some point in the day at the Rose Garden, or maybe in front of the White House at a different location that you know very well the steps. And we’ll see you tomorrow.
John: (38:51)
What’s the overall goal of the executive order in all of these reforms?
Donald Trump: (39:00)
The overall goal is we want law and order, and we want it done fairly justly. We want it done safely, but we want law and order, this is about a law and order, but it’s about justice also, and it’s about safety. So I think we’re going to do a good job tomorrow. I think you’re going to see some things that a lot of people thought would not happen, you wouldn’t be able to get them done, but we’ll get them done. Again though, I want to emphasize it’s possible the house can also on top of this, I spoke to the various leaders, on top of this can get something, but I think this will be very comprehensive tomorrow. So you’ll see something.
Speaker 1: (39:37)
What do you think of the Atlanta video that you’ve seen versus George Floyd’s?
Donald Trump: (39:44)
I thought it was a terrible… I’m not going to compare things, but I thought it was a terrible situation. I studied it closely. I’m going to get some reports done today, very strong reports. And we’ll have a little more to say about it tomorrow, but certainly, to me, it was very disturbing.
Speaker 1: (40:00)
Mr. President just a reaction.
Donald Trump: (40:01)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 1: (40:01)
A genuine reaction.
Donald Trump: (40:01)
…disturbing.
Speaker 2: (40:01)
Mr. President, just disturbing how?
Donald Trump: (40:02)
Go ahead please.
Speaker 2: (40:04)
Do you have any reaction to the Supreme Court decisions earlier today about LGBT discrimination [inaudible 00:40:09] protected under the Civil Rights Acts?
Donald Trump: (40:10)
No, they’ve ruled. I’ve read the decision and some people were surprised, but they’ve ruled and we live with that decision. That’s what it’s all about. We live with the decision of the Supreme Court. Very powerful. Very powerful decision actually, but they have so ruled. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 3: (40:30)
Mr. President, can you react to the FDA’s decision today to withdraw it’s recommendation for hydrochloroquine and another malaria drug, saying it’s no longer consider reasonable as a useful treatment for COVID?
Donald Trump: (40:43)
I don’t know. I’d like to ask Alex maybe to discuss that.
Alex Azar: (40:45)
Sure. So just to clarify your statement there, I don’t think was quite accurate in what the FDA’s action was. The FDA at the request of BARTA, which is an agency within HHS, withdrew an emergency use authorization for product that we had acquired into the national stockpile by donation from Bayer of chloroquine, that was manufactured in Pakistan and the EUA, the Emergency Use Authorization, was restricted for hospital use, inpatient hospital, use of the product. With the FDA finding that they don’t see enough data to support hospital-based use for those who were the most extreme cases of patients who’ve been hospitalized. They took that restriction off. They took the emergency use authorization off. At this point, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are just like any other approved drug in the United States. They may be used in hospital. They may be used in outpatient.
Alex Azar: (41:43)
They may be used at home. All subject to a doctor’s prescription. In fact, the FDA’s removal of the emergency use authorization takes away what had been a significant misunderstanding by many that had made people think that somehow it could only be used in a hospital setting. And we’ve tried to make that clear throughout. It’s a drug. It’s approved in the United States, has been for decades. If a doctor wishes to prescribe it working with the patient, they may prescribe it for any purpose that they wish to do so, and this actually removes a potential barrier to that.
Donald Trump: (42:15)
So it actually uncomplicates it, in a way. And I think that’s probably, your question was a very inaccurately stated question.
Speaker 3: (42:22)
I didn’t mean to post it inaccurately. I believe what it said specifically was that it’s no longer reasonable to consider it an appropriate treatment.
Alex Azar: (42:30)
Only in the hospital. It said the data in the hospital setting was not supported. We continue to study in outpatient settings as well as preventive. That data is not yet in.
Speaker 3: (42:41)
Are you suggesting that the data in the hospital setting is not something you would take seriously?
Alex Azar: (42:46)
No, that’s why the FDA acted. Was that they looked at the data and they removed the emergency use authorization for hospital setting use of the chloroquine, that was the Bayer product that had been donated from Pakistan.
Speaker 4: (42:58)
Mr. President, earlier today, you tweeted that you believe that you were being COVID shamed because of your decision to go ahead with the Tulsa rally on Saturday night. The director of the health department in the county and the city has encouraged you to postpone that, saying they still think that they’ve got too big of a COVID problem for you to pull off a rally like that. Your thoughts on that?
Donald Trump: (43:19)
Well Oklahoma’s doing very well. I just spoke to the governor. He’s very excited about it. Governor Stitt, who’s done a terrific job. Mike, I think you can maybe speak to this. He’s done a great job. Oklahoma’s at a very low number. They’ve done really fantastic work. They have a new, a pretty new magnificent arena as you probably have heard, and we’re getting exact numbers out, but we’re either close to, or over 1 million people wanting to go. We have a 22,000 seat arena, but I think we’re going to also take the convention hall next door.
Donald Trump: (43:55)
And that’s going to hold 40,000. So I have 22,000 plus 40,000, which would mean they would have over 900,000 people that won’t be able to go, but hopefully they’ll be watching, but it’s an amazing. Nobody’s ever heard of numbers like this. I think we’re going to have a great time. We’re going to talk about our nation. We’re going to talk about where we’re going, where we’ve come from. And I can tell you on COVID or coronavirus or whatever you want to call it. Plenty of names. Tremendous progress is being made. I spoke with the governor of Texas where they’ve done a fantastic job, but he said they have had some outbreaks in prisons and that’s where their numbers went out. And the numbers change a little bit because of the prison population, but he’s got it in great shape.
Donald Trump: (44:43)
Texas. Florida’s doing very well. Georgia’s doing very well. We have tremendous numbers. We have hotspots, as I said you might. And we take care of the hotspots, but many of the governors have done a very good job. Some not as good as others, some very good, but Oklahoma’s been a place that I think one of the reasons we chose it is because of how well they, because it’s early. It’s very early and because of what a great job the governor and everybody else has done in Oklahoma, and we expect to have, it’s a record setting crowd, we’ve never had an empty seat and we certainly won’t in Oklahoma.
Donald Trump: (45:21)
Mike, you want to talk about how well Oklahoma’s done relative to other places?
Mike Pence: (45:26)
Certainly Mr. President. President and I both spoken to Governor Kevin Stitt in the last several days. And even earlier today, and Oklahoma has really been in the forefront of our efforts to slow the spread and in a very real sense, they flattened the curve and today their hospital capacity is abundant. The number of cases in Oklahoma has declined precipitously, and we feel very confident going forward. And with the rally this coming weekend, we’re working closely with the governor. We’ll have measures in place to be screening people coming in to the facilities. But Oklahoma’s really led the way in demonstrating that we’d safely reopen. And so as we gather to hear from the President and hear about the stakes in this election, we’ll also be celebrating a state that’s demonstrated every day that you can put health first and open up and do all those things at the same time.
Donald Trump: (46:34)
And Mike, you gave me a number before. Nationwide overall, how are we doing?
Mike Pence: (46:37)
Well. It’s really remarkable, Mr. President. With more than 22 million tests having been performed across the country, we continue to see overall that the what’s called the positive test rate remains very stable in the country. As we said earlier, Mr. President, there’s a few states where the positivity rate is climbing and we’re working very closely with those governors to identify that. You mentioned that in the state of Texas, there was one county where there were literally three prisons that had individual outbreaks that accounted for literally hundreds of new cases in a single day. We’re also seeing in Imperial County, California, Americans who may live on the opposite side of the border in Mexico, coming home and that showing up in some of their numbers. But overall, the American people, I think are to be commended, Mr. President. That because of the steps they’ve taken and continue to take, we’re demonstrating that we could safely reopen and where we saw corona virus positive cases six weeks ago, over 30,000.
Mike Pence: (47:52)
Now it’s averaged in recent weeks, roughly 20,000 new cases a day. As I said, the positivity rate remains flat. Hospitalizations for coronavirus are declining all over the country. And most importantly, our fatality rate continues over a seven day average to continue to decline. President’s always quick to say one loss of life is too many. But when we think about a matter of a month and a half ago, when we were losing 2,500 Americans a day, now that we see the numbers declining so precipitously, I think it’s a real tribute to our healthcare workers, tribute to every American that has demonstrated each and every day that we can reopen our country, but we can continue to put the health particularly of our most vulnerable first.
Donald Trump: (48:48)
And yesterday’s number was approximately what?
Mike Pence: (48:53)
According to some public reporting, Mr. President, and I’ll have more details later this afternoon, less than 400 fatalities yesterday, all across the country.
Donald Trump: (49:02)
So that’s a far cry from what it was a month ago or two months ago. And it’s a lot. It’s 400 people too much. Shouldn’t happen at all. China should not have let it happen, but it happened. All over the world it’s happened. Which is a very sad thing, but our numbers really the low watermark and it’s getting better and it’ll end up being gone. We’re making very good headway with respect to vaccines, Alex. So we’re making very good headway therapeutically. And a cure was really, I think really, really tremendous headway. I’ve seen the results. I’ve met with some of the people that do the work. Smart people, great people, people that have succeeded before. I think vaccines are coming along far in advance of what they thought they would be. And I think we’ll have some very good news for you on vaccines and therapeutics and cures frankly.
Donald Trump: (49:56)
Because I guess, if you look at therapeutics, if acts fast enough, I guess you call it a cure. Wouldn’t you say? So I think we’re going to have some very good news on that, but we’re at a low, a low mark. And some of them, like in Texas where you had a prison population that went heavy and now it’s controlled. So we understand the disease. We’ve learned. I was with the governor of New Jersey the other night and we had a great talk about economic development and we’re going to be doing a big bridge that they’d been looking for I guess he said since 1918, they’ve been looking to redo it. So that’s a long time. And we’ve agreed to do that. It’s about $900 million, but he had mentioned 2,500 deaths or 12,500 deaths. 12,500 deaths.
Donald Trump: (50:50)
And out of that, there was one death under 18. I said, say it again. So it was over 12,000 and I guess the exact number was 12,500. And they did the study from that point. And out of that one death was under the age of 18, which is pretty amazing. I knew it was, which tells me the schools hopefully are going to be back in the fall. They’re going to be back in full blast. But the young people that have very strong immune systems. I imagine that’s the reason. But they’ve come out of this at a level that’s really inconceivable. By the way, the regular flu, other flus, other things. SARS or a H1N1, any of them, if you look at the young people, they were affected like everybody else, but for whatever reason, with respect to COVID, the numbers are very, very low. So yeah, please.
Speaker 5: (51:49)
Mr. President, are you still sending hydroxychloroquine to Brazil and other countries?
Donald Trump: (51:54)
Yeah. He’s asked for it and we’re sending it. Well, I can’t complain about it. I took it for two weeks and I’m here. Here we are. And we’ve had some great studies. I didn’t know about the report that Jeff asked about or the statement, but we’ve had some great reports coming out of France, coming out of Spain, coming out of other places. The only place we don’t get necessarily reports are coming out of Alex’s agency or wherever they come from. I don’t understand that, Alex, what is it exactly? Because I have had so many people that were so thrilled with the results from hydroxy. So what is that exactly?
Alex Azar: (52:35)
At your direction, we continue to study, especially in earlier phase. So a lot of the data that has come out that was more negative was people who were quite ill in the hospital.
Donald Trump: (52:48)
People that were seriously ill. Like they weren’t going to make it. Let’s give them a little hydroxy and then they’ll make it. They say, oh wow. Maybe the President was wrong. All I know is that we’ve had some tremendous reports. I’ve had a lot of people tell me that they think it saved their lives. The one woman, who’s a fantastic woman, the representative from Detroit, she was fantastic, but there are many people like that, that say the same thing. So I don’t know, but I took it and I felt good about taking it. I don’t know if it had an impact, but it certainly didn’t hurt me. I feel good.
Speaker 5: (53:29)
Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (53:30)
Yeah?
Speaker 5: (53:31)
The House Republicans today, they’re asking you to really reverse your decision on terminating the relationship with the WHO. Would you consider that ?
Donald Trump: (53:42)
I don’t know. I’d have to see what they’re asking. I have no idea what they’re asking.
Speaker 5: (53:49)
It was after an investigation.
Donald Trump: (53:49)
I have no idea what they’re asking. [crosstalk 00:53:51]. But I’ll take a look. The World Health Organization has been very disappointing to the world. They’ve been disappointing. And we, as you know, paid $450 million and close to $500 million on some years. But for years and years, we paid far more than anybody else. And they’ve been a puppet of China. And so, no, I’m not reconsidering unless they get their act together. And I’m not sure they can at this point, but maybe. Certainly over the years they might, but they have been a disaster. They were wrong on every call, including when I said we’re going to close up the United States to people coming in from China, where China was heavily infected at that time and possibly still is. And I closed it. And that was a wise decision. There were a lot of people, even on the other side, the enemy. We’ll call them the enemy. They said that was an incredible decision. I don’t know how Trump made that decision, but he made that decision and we saved thousands of lives. Hundreds of thousands of lives. Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 3: (54:47)
Mr. President, just on a separate issue.
Donald Trump: (54:50)
No, no. Behind you.
Speaker 3: (54:50)
I apologize.
Speaker 6: (54:51)
Mr. President, can you say why you’re suing John Bolton to prevent publishing his book?
Donald Trump: (54:55)
Well, I don’t know. I’d have to ask the Attorney General, but I will say if he’s doing a book, I think it’s totally inappropriate that he does a book. I think a guy, I gave him a break. He couldn’t get Senate confirmed. He was never Senate confirmed the first time. I don’t think he’s supposed to even be calling himself an ambassador because he couldn’t get Senate confirmed. He got in through a little trick and he was there for a fairly short period of time. I put him here because he couldn’t get Senate confirmed. This was a non Senate confirmed position, as you know. He stayed for a short while and I felt that it was not appropriate that he stay any longer. I wasn’t impressed. And somebody said he went out and wrote a book. If he wrote a book, I can’t imagine that he can because that’s highly classified information. Even conversations with me, they’re highly classified.
Donald Trump: (55:44)
I told that to the Attorney General before. I will consider every conversation with me as President highly classified. So that would mean that if he wrote a book and if the book gets out, he’s broken the law. And I would think that he would have criminal problems. I hope so. Otherwise, I mean, they put a sailor in jail because he sent a photograph of his bed and an engine of an old submarine. And if this guy’s writing things about conversations or about anything, and maybe he’s not telling the truth. He’s been known not to tell the truth. A lot. So we’ll have to see what the book is all about. But a lot of people are upset with him for writing a book. A lot of people are very angry with him for writing a book, but it’s up to the Attorney General. Bill, do you have anything to say about it?
Bill Barr: (56:29)
Well, people who come to work in the government and have access to sensitive information generally sign an agreement that says that when they leave government, if they write something that draws on or might reflect some of the information they’ve had access to, they have to go through a clearance process before they can publish the book. And we don’t believe that Bolton went through that process. Hasn’t completed the process and therefore is in violation of that agreement.
Speaker 6: (57:05)
So what is the DOJ doing…?
Donald Trump: (57:06)
And that’s criminal liability, by the way, you’re talking about. You’re not talking about like he’s got to return $3 that he made on a book that’s called criminal liability. That’s a big thing. Hillary Clinton, she deleted 33,000 emails. And if we ever found out what those emails say, she would’ve had a liability. That’s what you have. You have liability.
Speaker 6: (57:26)
Could the Attorney General tell us what the DOJ is doing in terms of the Bolton book?
Bill Barr: (57:30)
Well there’s a number of things. The thing that is front and center right now is trying to get him to complete the process. Go through the process and make the necessary deletions of classified information.
Speaker 6: (57:43)
But the book has been published.
Bill Barr: (57:45)
No it hasn’t.
Speaker 6: (57:45)
Yes, it’s been published. It’s just not released yet.
Bill Barr: (57:48)
It’s being printed.
Bill Barr: (57:52)
According to sources, it’s being printed. Hasn’t been released.
Speaker 6: (57:57)
So are you going to court to try to stop?
Bill Barr: (57:59)
I said what we were doing. Was try to get them to complete the clearance process that’s required.
Speaker 3: (58:05)
His lawyer says that he thought that they had completed the process. Were there changes after that first iteration?
Bill Barr: (58:12)
Well, he hasn’t completed the process.
Donald Trump: (58:15)
He never completed the process. He knew that.
Bill Barr: (58:18)
This is unprecedented, really. I don’t know of any book that’s been published so quickly while the office holders are still in government and it’s about very current events and current leaders and current discussions and current policy issues, which many of which are inherently classified.
Speaker 6: (58:38)
Have you read the book, sir?
Donald Trump: (58:40)
I have not read it, no. I haven’t seen it. I haven’t seen it.
Donald Trump: (58:43)
But he knows. And he was advised not to write it. And he was advised very strongly not to write it until it’s cleared and he couldn’t wait and we’ll see what happens. But I think he’s got, personally, I would imagine he has like when you do classified, that to me is a very strong criminal problem. And he knows he’s got classified information. Any conversation with me is classified. Then it becomes even worse if he lies about the conversation. Which I understand he might have in some cases. So we’ll see what happens. They’re in court or they’ll soon be in court, but he understands he did not complete a process or anywhere near complete a process.
Speaker 3: (59:28)
On a separate foreign policy, sir. You’ve faced a little bit of criticism from congressional Republicans, including Representative Cheney about your decision to withdraw troops from Germany. Are you reconsidering that at all?
Donald Trump: (59:40)
So we have 52,000 soldiers in Germany. That’s a tremendous amount of soldiers. It’s a tremendous cost to the United States. And Germany, as you know, is very delinquent in their payments to NATO. And they’re paying 1% and their supposed to be at 2% and the 2% is very low.
Donald Trump: (01:00:03)
… 1% and this is supposed to be a 2%, and the 2% is very low, it should be much more than that. So they’re delinquent of billions of dollars, and this is for years, delinquent. So, we’re removing a number down to… We’re putting the number down to 25,000 soldiers, we’ll see what happens. But Germany has not been making payment. In addition to that, I was the one that brought it up. Everybody talks about Trump with the Russia. Well, I brought this up a long time ago. Why is Germany paying Russia billions of dollars for energy? And then we’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia? How does that work? It doesn’t work. So, Germany is delinquent. They’ve been delinquent for years. And they owe NATO billions of dollars, and they have to pay it. So, we’re protecting Germany and they’re delinquent, that doesn’t make sense. So, I said, we’re going to bring down the soldier count to 25,000 soldiers.
Donald Trump: (01:00:52)
It’s around 52,000 now, but it varies, but it’s a lot. And as you know, those are well-paid soldiers. They live in Germany, they spend vast amounts of money in Germany, everywhere around those bases is very prosperous for Germany. So, Germany takes. And then on top of it, they treat us very badly on trade. We have trade with the EU, and Germany being the biggest member, very badly on trade. And we’re negotiating with them on that. But right now, I’m not satisfied with the deal they want to make. They’ve cost the United States, hundreds of billions of dollars over the years on trade. So, we get hurt on trade and we get hurt on NATO. Now with NATO, I’ve raised other countries $140 billion. They’re paying $140 billion more because I interceded. I said, “Look, we’re protecting you. You have to pay your bills.” Because it was going like this until I got here.
Donald Trump: (01:01:50)
Now, it’s going like a rocket ship. But one of the only countries that hasn’t agreed to pay what they’re supposed to pay, is Germany. So I said, until they pay we’re removing our soldiers, a number of our soldiers by about half. And then when we get down to 25,000, we’ll see where we’re going. But Germany has been delinquent. And why should we be doing what we’re doing if they don’t pay? And they’re supposed to pay. And the number they’re supposed to pay, actually at 2%, the 2% should be higher. And we’re also talking about for many years, this isn’t a new phenomena, this has gone on for many years. Where they’ve taken advantage of the United States. But everybody has, under Biden and under Obama, what they’ve done to this country is unbelievable. And I’m not only talking about Germany, by the way, I’m talking about plenty of other countries. But NATO now, is paying $140 billion more.
Donald Trump: (01:02:44)
If you look at the secretary general, who’s terrific, Stoltenberg, he’s been terrific. He’s probably my biggest fan. He said, “Nobody else could have done what Trump did.” Because, I raised the other countries by $140 billion. Because we end up paying the difference, The United States pays the difference to protect Europe. So, we protect them and then they take advantage of us on trade for many years. We’re not talking about now, less so now, for many years. So, we’re working on a deal with them, but it’s very unfair. And I would say, by far the worst abuser, is Germany.
Speaker 7: (01:03:22)
Mr. President, on Seattle-
Speaker 8: (01:03:23)
[crosstalk 01:03:23].
Speaker 7: (01:03:24)
You said last week on Seattle, that if the Mayor of Seattle, the Governor of Washington, didn’t take steps to end the occupation of the Capitol Hill neighborhood, you would step in and you would do something.
Donald Trump: (01:03:34)
A hundred percent.
Speaker 7: (01:03:35)
They still haven’t ended it, they’re negotiating. Are you considering taking action?
Donald Trump: (01:03:39)
Yeah, [crosstalk 00:03:38]. They’re negotiating garbage removal. They’re… These people have taken over a vast part, a major part, a very good part, of a place called, Seattle. Seattle is big stuff. That’s a major city. And we have a governor who’s a stiff. And we have a mayor who said, “Oh, this is going to be a love fest.” And by the way, these are violent people that took it over. These are not people that are nice people. I saw her on your network today, John, I saw what went on with the hitting and the punching and the beating and all the other things going on in Seattle. And you have a governor that doesn’t do a damn thing about it. And you have a mayor that doesn’t know she’s alive. She’s talking about, it’s going to be a love fest, this summer. Now, if they don’t do the job, I’ll do the job. And I’ve already spoken to the attorney general about it. But if they don’t do the job, we will do the job.
Speaker 7: (01:04:28)
What can you do?
Donald Trump: (01:04:30)
About 10 different things. Either… Any one of which will solve the problem quickly.
Speaker 7: (01:04:35)
Can we go through a whole list or partial [inaudible 00:01:04:36]?
Donald Trump: (01:04:37)
We don’t have to go through any list, we can do a lot of things.
Speaker 9: (01:04:39)
Mr. President-
Donald Trump: (01:04:40)
I think it’s incredible also that the radical left press doesn’t cover it. They’re acting like nothing happened. You turn on the news, you look at the news, you look… You don’t even see stories about it. If the right ever took over a city, conservative Republicans took over a city, it would be the biggest story in history. You can’t even find stories about Seattle. It’s incredible.
Speaker 7: (01:05:06)
How much [inaudible 01:05:06]?
Donald Trump: (01:05:06)
They’ve taken over… We’ll see. They’ve… I’ll tell you what, the American public is very angered by that. Seattle is a major important city. And the Democrats, I guess you say radical left, but it’s not even radical left, it’s just Democrat. Where we have a problem, are Democrat run cities. If you look at Minneapolis, if you look at other cities that have had trouble, they had Democrat in virtually every case that I can think of, I can’t think of one other case. These are Democrat run cities, Minneapolis, where the police are told to run for your lives. Don’t do anything. And if I didn’t get involved and send in the National Guard, and it was at my insistence that they did that, and as soon as I did that, everything stopped in Minneapolis, four days, five days later.
Speaker 7: (01:05:57)
Is there a timeline that you’re thinking here if Seattle…
Donald Trump: (01:05:59)
There’s no timeline, we’re watching it very closely. These are violent people that are dealing violently. And I think what would… What I’d like to see before we do something, I’d like to see the press get in and cover it. Because they’re not… It’s not that they’re covering it badly, they’re hardly covering at all. Think of this, a group, Antifa and others, radical lefts, they went into a major US city, Seattle, and they took over a big percentage of that city and the press doesn’t want to cover it. And we have a mayor who’s scared stiff, she doesn’t know what’s happening. We have a governor that’s one of the most overrated politicians in the country. He just ran for president, he got less than 1%. He actually probably, I would have said less than zero, but I’m not sure that’s possible. He got nothing. He got no votes, nothing. The whole thing, the guy was out there fighting. At the end, he got zero, right? Zero. So he failed.
Donald Trump: (01:06:57)
And now he goes back and they take over his city and he doesn’t say anything about it. Worse, he said, he didn’t hear… A day later he said, “I never… I didn’t hear anything about it.” They took over a city, Seattle, and he said, I didn’t hear anything about it. So look, the governor has to call out the troops, do what he has to do, has to call out the National Guard, has to do something. Because the problem with what happened in Seattle is, it spreads. And all of a sudden they’ll say, let’s do some other city, and let’s do another one. And we’re not going to let it happen. So, timing wise, Hey, we’re all set to go. We’re watching the process. But the most amazing thing about the process is how the fake news media doesn’t want to cover it. To me, that’s the most amazing thing. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it, thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:07:46)
Saturday night will be a big night, that’s a big night. Hope you’re all going to be there. It’s going to be very big. Thank you."
"Jun 11, 2020",4:30 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (08:01)
Nice place. Wow. I’ve been hearing about this one. Great job. Great job. Thank you very much for being here. It’s an honor and very important time in our country. A lot of things are happening and I think when it all ends up, it’s going to end up very good for everybody. It’s an honor to be at Gateway Church with the Attorney General, our great Attorney General, William Barr. And my friend, Ben Carson, who has done a fantastic job at HUD Secretary. And a young star, Jerome Adams, General. Where is Jerome? Jerome. Along with a lot of my friends out in the audience. In fact, a lot of the great political leaders from Texas I see. Some great, great friends and I want to thank you all for being here. Faith leaders, members of law enforcement, so important. We want law and order. We have to have a lot of good things, but we have to have law and order.
Donald Trump: (09:09)
Got to have some strength. You have to have strength. You have to do what you have to do. And you look at a Seattle. We just came in. We just see over the screen and we’ve been hearing about it. Bill and I were talking about it. The law and order, look at what happened in Seattle. They took over a city, a city, a big city, Seattle, a chunk of it. A big chunk. Can’t happen. That couldn’t happen here I don’t think in the state of Texas. I don’t think so. I don’t think so.
Donald Trump: (09:39)
So I want to thank Pastors Robert Morris and Steve Dolan. They’re great people, great people with a great reputation. I have to say that, great reputation. And Gateway Church, the team has been incredible in hosting us. And I’d now like to ask Pastor Morris and Bishop Jackson to lead us in prayer. Thank you.
Pastor Robert Morris: (10:01)
Thank you. Lord, we need you. We need you at this time in our country and I thank you for our president. I thank you, Lord, for our leaders. I thank you, thank you, thank you. I know in the Bible that when something was emphasized, it was repeated. Holy, holy, holy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Lord, that we are about to bring tremendous progress to a problem that’s been here for a long time. And I thank you for this administration and Lord, we pray your blessings, your guidance today on this meeting in Jesus name.
Bishop Jackson: (10:41)
Father, we thank you so much for what you’re doing today. You have revealed so many things that are untoward, even evil, but we ask according to Isaiah 50 verse four, that you would give us the tongue of the learned, that we should know how to speak to the heart of this nation. Give us a word in season to him that’s weary and waken us morning by morning, God, that we would hear and speak. We have a great courageous president who’s a problem solver. And let him speak as your mouth piece and act as your instrument. And we thank you for this time. Amen.
Donald Trump: (11:38)
Thank you very much, Bishop. I want to thank you Bishop and thank you very much, Pastor. That’s great. And we’re going to be discussing some pretty important things today I think. It’s all important, but the timing of this is very appropriate. This was set up actually a long time ago, but the timing very appropriate.
Donald Trump: (11:55)
We are here to listen to community and faith leaders. Going to be hearing from a lot of the good ones, some of the great ones, but a lot of the good ones, and to present our vision of advancing the cause of justice and freedom. From day one, I’ve been fighting for the forgotten men and women of America. And I think we’ve been doing a great job of it. We’ve been doing a lot in many other ways, but it gets lost a little bit sometimes, Bishop, you know that, it gets lost. We’ve done so much and a lot of the things that we’ve done that we’re very proud of gets lost. Like we got criminal justice reform passed and they’ve been trying to do it for many years and they haven’t been able to. We secured permanent and record setting funding for HPCUs, that’s historically black colleges and universities. It was all done.
Donald Trump: (12:53)
We created tens of thousands of jobs with opportunity zones. Tim Scott and we had a great senator from South Carolina that many of you know, he came with an idea and I thought it was a great idea and we got it done. A lot of people said that could never happen, but nobody thought it would be successful like it is. Tens of thousands of jobs and investment in communities where that money wouldn’t go. And we achieved the lowest black unemployment in the history of our country prior to the plague coming in from China. And we’ll get it back again soon. It’ll happen soon. That will happen very soon.
Donald Trump: (13:28)
In recent days there have been vigorous discussion about how to ensure fairness, equality, and justice for all of our people. Unfortunately there are some trying to stoke division and to push an extreme agenda which we won’t go for that will produce only more poverty, more crime, more suffering. This includes radical efforts to defund, dismantle and disband the police. They want to get rid of the police forces. They actually want to get rid of it. And that’s what they do. And that’s where they’d go. And you know that because at the top position there’s not going to be much leadership. There’s not much leadership left.
Donald Trump: (14:07)
Instead we have to go the opposite way. We must invest more energy and resources in police training and recruiting and community engagement. We have to respect our police. We have to take care of our police. They’re protecting us. And if they’re allowed to do their job, they’ll do a great job. And you always have a bad apple. No matter where you go, you have bad apples and there are not too many of them. And I can tell you there are not too many of them in the police department. We all know a lot of members of the police.
Donald Trump: (14:33)
I was listening today, a friend of mine was on, very important person, said some of the best people he’s ever met are policemen, law enforcement people. And they’re taking care of people that in many cases they never even met before and at great danger, at great risk. They get shot for no reason whatsoever other than they’re wearing blue. They get knifed. You saw that the other night. It was a horrible thing. But there is no opportunity without safety in Chicago. 48 people were shot and 18 people were killed in one day, Sunday, May 31st. Think of that. 48 people shot. 18 people killed. You don’t hear about it too much.
Donald Trump: (15:15)
Every child should be able to grow up in a safe community, free from violence and fear. They’ve taken a lot of the police protection away in Chicago and they have great, great police in Chicago. I know Chicago very well, but they’re not allowed to do what they can do better than anybody. They could do the job very easily. Americans are good and virtuous people. We have to work together to confront bigotry and prejudice wherever they appear, but we’ll make no progress and heal no wounds by falsely labeling tens of millions of decent Americans as racist or bigots. We have to get everybody together. We have to be in the same path. I think, Pastor, if we don’t do that, we have problems and we’ll do that. We’ll do it. I think we’re going to do it very easily. It’ll go quickly and it’ll go very easily.
Donald Trump: (16:05)
We have so many different elements of strength in this country. We have such potential in this country. We have the greatest potential. We have the greatest country in the world. But we get off subject. We start thinking about things that don’t matter or don’t matter much. And the important things we don’t even discuss, but we’re here to discuss some very important things today.
Donald Trump: (16:26)
Politicians make false charges and they’re trying to distract from their own failed records. They have some very bad records and these are usually the ones that cause the problems or can’t solve the problems. These are the same politicians who shipped our jobs away and took tremendous advantage of all Americans, but African American middle class. So much of that wealth and that money and those jobs went to China and other countries and they get trapped. They get trapped. They get trapped in a government morass. They get trapped in bad government schools.
Donald Trump: (17:03)
So I’m going to be announcing four steps to build safety and opportunity and dignity. First we’re aggressively pursuing economic development in minority communities. We’re doing it very powerfully. We’ve done it with opportunity zones, but we’re going to go above that. At the heart of this effort is increasing access to capital for small businesses and that’s with minority owners in black communities and we’re going to get it done and it should have been done a long time ago. It’s been very difficult, very, very difficult for some people, been unfairly difficult.
Donald Trump: (17:38)
Second we’re confronting the healthcare disparities, including addressing chronic conditions and investing substantial sums in minority serving medical institutions. We have medical institutions in some areas of our country that are a disgrace. I was going to say not up to standard. They’re much worse than not up to standard. They’re a disgrace. Take care of it.
Donald Trump: (18:02)
Third, we’re working to finalize an executive order that will encourage police departments nationwide to meet the most current professional standards for the use of force, including tactics for deescalation. Also we’ll encourage pilot programs that allow social workers to join certain law enforcement officers so that they work together. We’ll take care of our police. We’re not defunding police. If anything, we’re going the other route. We’re going to make sure that our police are well-trained, perfectly trained, they have the best equipment.
Donald Trump: (18:43)
Some of the things that we have heard, because I know a lot of the people in the audience and they’re professionals at what they do and they’re successful people. And we’re hearing things that are not even thinkable. I didn’t even hear, I’ve never even heard of this before last week. It was like, it started about a week ago where I heard they want to close up all police forces. That’s what their attack on a very liberal governor in the state of Washington is. We want the police force closed. It’s not like they want to sort of bring a little money into something else. They want it actually closed. I’m thinking what happens late at night when you make that call to 911 and there’s nobody there. What do you do? Whether you’re white, black, or anybody else, what do you do? You’re dialing and there’s somebody breaking into a house and it happens to be a violent person.
Donald Trump: (19:34)
There are violent people around, Pastor. Even, you will admit that, right? We want to think the best, but you have some very violent people. And when they’re breaking into your house at 12:00 in the evening and you’re sitting there and you don’t have a police force, they’re actually talking about not having a police force. Well, that’s not happening with us. We’re going to have stronger police forces because that’s what you need. In Minneapolis, they went through three nights of hell. And then I was insistent on having the National Guard go in and do their work. It was like a miracle. It’s just everything stopped. And I’ll never forget the scene. It’s not supposed to be a beautiful scene. But to me, it was after you watched policemen running out of a police precinct. And it wasn’t their fault.
Donald Trump: (20:19)
They wanted to do what they had to do, but they weren’t allowed to do anything. It wasn’t really their fault, but they were running down the street. They weren’t allowed to do what they’re trained to do. And they took over the precinct. They burned it, essentially burned it down. I’m pretty good at construction. I want to tell you that was almost what we call a complete renovation, if you’re lucky. And it was a very sad thing. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like that. But we are very proud of the fact that I called, I said, “I’m sorry. We have to have them go in.” And they went in and it was like a knife cutting butter, right through, boom. I’ll never forget. You saw the scene on that road wherever it may be in the city, Minneapolis. They were lined up. Boom. They just walked straight.
Donald Trump: (21:09)
And yes, there was some tear gas and probably some other things and the crowd dispersed. And they went through it by the end of that evening. And it was a short evening. Everything was fine. And you didn’t hear too much about that location having problems anymore. They went to other locations and the same thing would happen. As an example, Seattle would be so easy to solve, would be so easy to solve. We have a governor here of a great state it’s called Texas. He would solve it very easily. As would other of your political leaders, including your Lieutenant Governor, they would solve it very easily. A lot of it’s common sense. I don’t even think it’s courage. I think it’s probably more courageous the other way, because I wouldn’t want to be doing it the other way. It’s very unsafe. So I just want to tell you that we’re working on a lot of different elements having to do with law, order, safety, comfort, control, but we want safety. We want compassion. We want everything.
Donald Trump: (22:19)
What happened two weeks ago was a disgrace when you see that. What happened on numerous occasions over the last two weeks, people were killed. Number of people were killed and it was very, very terrible and very, very unfair. Number of them were police officers. And it was a very unfair situation. We don’t want to see that. And with strength, you wouldn’t even have that. They wouldn’t be in a position to do the kind of damage that they’ve done. They’ve destroyed people. They’ve destroyed businesses. They’ve destroyed African-American owned small businesses that hopefully they’re going to come back. We’re providing funding for a lot of small businesses and hopefully we’ll be able to get everybody online and get funding to be able to open up their stores and their small businesses again.
Donald Trump: (23:06)
But we’re working to finalize an executive order that will encourage police departments nationwide to meet the most current professional standards of force. And that means force but force with compassion. But if you’re going to have to really do a job, if somebody is really bad, you’re going to have to do it with real strength, real power. And I said, and people said, “Oh, I don’t know if we like that expression.” I said, “We have to dominate the streets. You can’t let that happen, what happened in New York City. The damage they’ve done, you have to dominate the street.”
Donald Trump: (23:37)
And I was criticized for that statement. I made the statement we have to dominate the street and they said, “Oh, that’s such a terrible thing.” Well, guess what you know who dominated the streets? People that you don’t want to dominate the streets and look at the damage they did. So I’ll stick with that. And I think most of the people in this room, maybe every person in this room will stick with that and we’re doing it with compassion, if you think about it. We’re dominating the street with compassion.
Donald Trump: (24:03)
We’re doing it with compassion if you think about it. We’re dominating the street with compassion because we’re saving lives and we’re saving businesses, we’re saving families from being wiped out after working hard for 20 and 30 years. I saw the one woman, she worked 35 years building a store and in one night it was totally wiped out. It’s terrible and forth we’re renewing our call on Congress to finally enact school choice now. School choice is a big deal. Because access to education is the civil rights issue of our time. And I’ve heard that for the last I would say year, but it really it’s a civil rights issue of our time. When you can have children go to a school where their parents want them to go and it creates competition and other schools fight harder because all of a sudden they say, “Wow! We’re losing it we have to fight hard.”
Donald Trump: (24:54)
It gets better so many different ways. But there are groups of people against it. You have unions against it. You have others against it and they’re not against it for the right reasons, they’re against it for a lot of the wrong reasons. And we’re going to get that straightened out. We’ve done a lot of it. We’ve had tremendous success with choice. We had choice in a lot of ways. We also have choice in the military. Before I came here the vets would wait online pastor, it wouldn’t be acceptable to you I know it wouldn’t be acceptable to the Bishop. I know it can’t be acceptable to you. They’d wait for four or five weeks to get online of that. Where they were sick, they were feeling badly and they’d get online and they’d say there’s a six day wait sir, there’s a two week wait, there’s a one month wait.
Donald Trump: (25:43)
And you’d have people online that weren’t very ill and they’d be terminally ill before they got to see a doctor, they’d die. And for years and years they’ve been trying to get veteran’s choice. That means if you can’t get to a doctor reasonably quickly you go outside, you go to a local doctor around where you live and the government pays the bill. And by the way, it sounds expensive it’s very cheap by comparison. It’s actually much better now. Most importantly we take care of our vets, by far most importantly. But it’s one of those many cases where it’s actually less costly and better. Sometimes you’ll see a building it costs less money than another building that costs more because the one that built the one that cost more this one looks better. The one that’s cheaper it looks better. They say, “How much more did you spend for that building?” “Actually, we spent less.” You can do that, it’s called you have to know what you’re doing, if you know what you’re doing. That’s only good for the real estate people in here of which there are plenty by the way.
Donald Trump: (26:48)
So I just want to thank everybody. This is a tremendous place, it’s a great city, it’s a great city and with tremendous people and tremendous pride. And I say the same for the state of Texas. Your governor came to me and he said when you had your bad hurricane two years ago, I gave up so much money to Texas more. He kept coming more, how about here? So finally we took good care of Texas. Is that right? We took such good care of Texas. They were looking for the next hurricane. They said, “When’s the next one? But they had a big one. And they say you had the largest water dump ever. It just didn’t stop. It came in and you thought it was gone and then it went back out and it reloaded, right? And it happened three times and your governor came and he wanted to build a barrier so the water would hit the barrier wouldn’t come into certain parts of Texas. He called me he said, “Sir I just have one more request.” This is after we gave $28 billion. So 28 billion.
Donald Trump: (27:50)
I mean we watch the pennies, but when it comes to Texas we don’t watch them too closely. And he said, governor Abbott he said, “Just one more request and it’s a very small one, sir. We have a way of building a wall it goes up and down. It moves with the tides.” I said, “That sounds expensive to me.” “It was with the tides and it’s not a lot of money. Could I ask you to do me one small favor and approve it?” I said, “How much is it?” “Sir it’s only $10 billion.” And I said, “Start working on it.” Right? I said start working on it. Because we can do things to get rid of those. You get hit pretty hard here. They get hit pretty hard here don’t they? Were you affected very much when you had, during the hurricanes itself?
Speaker 5: (28:38)
We had a lot of people who were displaced that came to this area.
Donald Trump: (28:38)
Yeah. Well we took good care of everybody.
Speaker 5: (28:40)
Yes you did.
Donald Trump: (28:40)
So I just want to say this is one of my favorite places I know we’re doing very well here. During the last process they kept saying that Texas’ too close to call and friends of mine in Texas say, “It’s not too close to call you’re going to win in a landslide.” And I said, “Well, they keep saying…” We had one man got on television actually and he said, “I don’t know where you come from but I don’t think this is too close to call. I think he’s going to win by a lot.” We won by a lot. It was eight o’clock and the polls were closed and they said Donald Trump has won the state of Texas. And he said it’s simultaneous. We’re doing good here again. But you know one of the things I’d have to say, because this is big oil territory. I think we’ve done a fantastic job with bringing back the oil in a rapid fashion. That looked pretty bad.
Donald Trump: (29:32)
You had a couple of hours where if you bought a barrel of oil you bought it for $37 as if they gave you 37, okay. There’s never been a thing like that ever. Now I see that it’s getting close to $40 a barrel and you’re back in business and we got it done fast. And we got Russia together with Saudi Arabia and they cut production and they got it back fast and we’re very proud of it. The supply changed rapidly with COVID-19 or whatever you want to call it. I’d never heard so many names, you have about 30 names you can call this thing. I call it the plague from China, the plague. And it’s not good. Could have been stopped, it could have been stopped in China, but they decided not to do that. And we’ll have to figure that one out won’t we?
Donald Trump: (30:24)
So I just want to thank everybody very much for being here. This is a very spectacular place. And I want to introduce the attorney general Barr and secretary Carson to say a few words. Along with the surgeon general who has been a real young star in the administration. And please, if I could Bill take over, please. Thank you very much.
William Barr: (30:51)
Thank you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (30:52)
Thank you.
William Barr: (30:52)
Thank you Mr. President and thank you for convening this discussion. And I’d like to thank the many impressive leaders, civic leaders, religious leaders and colleagues from law enforcement that are here. That gustly spectacle in Minneapolis was really jarring to the whole nation. And it forced us to confront and think about reflect on longstanding issues in our nation. Those issues obviously relate to the relationship between law enforcement and the African- American community. But just to step back a little and take a broader view initially, I’ve been thinking about how do we achieve the full American dream for rural communities, African-American communities, all communities. And one of the reasons I’m proud to serve in this administration is because I think the president is moving forward on the critical elements necessary to provide and ensure that opportunity. First and foremost, economic growth without growth there is no opportunity.
William Barr: (32:14)
Second, education. I think Condi Rice said a few years ago it’s the civil rights issue of our time because without a good education, we are not allowing our young people to seize their opportunities and pursue their dreams. And as the president mentioned, it’s only by empowering parents and giving them the power to choose the education for their children that we’re ever going to be able to obtain that. Third, I think is moral discipline. And our young people, they have to have the discipline to seize the opportunity to make momentary sacrifices for later gain. And traditionally that has come and people can find it perhaps from many sources, but traditionally that has come from religion, which our founders believed was the foundation of our Republic. And we have to stop policies that undermine religion or relegate religion out of the public square. Now I get to my job which is safety. Without safety you cannot have progress. You can’t have a life, a decent life in a community. And this was struck home to me 30 years ago when I visited Trenton when I was attorney general last time I went to a small barbershop in an African-American neighborhood. And there were people there in their sixties and seventies and they said, “Mr. Barr we’re in our golden years and we are living behind bars. Look down the street, all the bars are on our windows and the criminals run free on the street.” Now, we’ve made a lot of progress since then. The crime rate has been cut in half and a big part of that has been improvement in police and the progress we’ve made in policing. And yes, the progress that police have made, police departments have made in building relationships with the community.
William Barr: (34:26)
I think law enforcement has understood for a long time that there is distrust in the African-American community toward the law enforcement system. And when you reflect on our history, you can understand why. Because for most of our history just up until the last 60 years, the institutions in this country, the laws and the institutions were explicitly discriminatory. There was not equal protection of the law by law. And it’s only been since Jim Crow that our laws have been changed to provide for equal justice and what we’ve had really since… And so the civil rights effort up until that time was to tear down institutions. But I don’t think now is the time to be tearing down our institutions because we’ve been on a March for the last 50 years of reforming our institutions and we don’t need to tear them down. We have to be mature about this.
William Barr: (35:21)
And when we see problems, we have to redouble our efforts to reform our institutions and make sure they’re in sync with our values. And I don’t think anyone who’s honest would deny that we’ve made a lot of progress in policing over the last 50 years. And in fact one of the things about this episode in Minneapolis was how fast both the state and federal law enforcement responded to dealing with that action. So I think that while we saw something very bad, it has helped perhaps galvanize the will of the country to bring good out of that. And we can’t let that incident obscure the fact that progress has been made, that policemen are by and large by overwhelming majority good, decent people who care about their community and put their lives on the line for us, the neighbors.
William Barr: (36:21)
And we can’t lose sight of the fact we can’t let this event obscure the fact that the real oppression and danger to our communities comes more from violent crime and lawlessness than it does from the police. Now we’ve never had a president who was more committed to reforming law enforcement. And he’s done that with the first step back and with the first police commission since Lyndon Johnson. And I’m very optimistic about what we’re going to be able to do given his leadership, but also given the leadership of our police forces, which around the country increasingly it’d become better and better led. And I think the police profession is itself committed to addressing the issues that we saw in Minneapolis and completing the process of professionalizing policing in this country.
William Barr: (37:29)
And as the president said, we’re working on a number of things through the commission that he set up and also through an executive order to propel that process even faster by looking at how we can encourage the adoption of guidelines about the use of force that are acceptable, both to the community and to the police profession. But also to encourage certification of police forces and also through such activities as increasing grants to encourage the use of call responders more and more our police are being asked to deal with problems that hasn’t previously been the problem of law enforcement.
William Barr: (38:17)
They have to deal with homeless people, they have to deal with a lot of mental health issues. They have to deal with drug addiction, the drug addicts and so forth and providing some additional support to the police in these areas is going to be important. So let me just say that the department of justice is committed to support the president’s efforts here, do all we can to bring good out of this bad incident. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (38:46)
Thank you Barr, thank you. Surgeon general please go ahead. You want to go? Go ahead, why don’t you go then Ben will go. Is that okay?
Jerome Adams: (39:00)
All right.
Donald Trump: (39:00)
Good. Go ahead.
Jerome Adams: (39:01)
Well, thank you Mr. President I appreciate it. Thank you everyone for coming today. Thank you to the panelists. I just want to start off by saying that many people across the country and across the great state of Texas are hurting right now due to the tragedy that occurred to George Floyd. And I just want to extend my condolences to the Floyd family and to the entire Texas community, because I know that you all live together, you work together, you play together and you’re hurt together here in Texas. And so I want you to know that I feel that for you. The president asked me to give you a quick update on America’s COVID-19 response. Thanks to cooperation with state and local partners we’re making progress against the virus, we are and towards a safe reopening. Through strong public and private partnerships, America has now done more than 20 million tests.
Jerome Adams: (40:09)
And that number is a big number, it’s not just about the number it’s also about how many of those tests are coming back positive. We have a positive rate under 6% nationally and from a public health perspective if we’re under 10% positive, we’re doing a good job. So there’s a lot of challenges out there, but I want you all to know that we are moving in the right direction. The data shows that we are moving in the right direction as a nation. And this has happened in part thanks to opening of over 500 community based testing sites through the work of private sector partners in the United States public health service, which I helped lead with Admiral Giroir. 70% of those sites are in CDC designated vulnerable areas. That means that we’re taking the testing to those who need it the most, to those who are most at risk.
Jerome Adams: (40:55)
We also have testing at 92% of America’s community health centers, which predominantly served low income areas and communities of color. We’ve helped equip our frontline workers, our healthcare heroes with 94 million N95 respirators, 149 million surgical masks and more than a billion gloves. And a large proportion of those supplies at the president and the secretary’s direction are going to nursing homes. And I see the governor over there, I want to give you all a shout out. Texas has led the way in nursing home testing. A hundred percent of their nursing homes have been tested. They’re leading the way and testing people in corrections facilities, over 95% of people in corrections facilities have been tested. That is something you all should be tremendously proud of.
Jerome Adams: (41:50)
And these efforts have allowed states to proceed with a safe reopening. While we work with states to monitor the incoming data, we know we’re going to have clusters while we respond to spikes and we adjust policies as needed. But I want you to know that safe reopening is crucial for other areas in health too. We need Americans to be able to return to cancer screenings. My wife just finished cancer treatment. If she’d had to wait six months to get her cancer screen she might not be here today. We need people to get their surgeries. We need people to get their vaccinations. 4.2 million children are behind on vaccinations now because of the COVID closures. We know every 1% increase in unemployment equates to a 1.3% increase in suicides. 1.3% increase in suicides. So we want to reopen safely, we also have to remember that being shutdown has health consequences beyond COVID. We know that being out of school is bad for your health. We need to get our kids back in school safely.
Jerome Adams: (42:59)
I have a 15, a 14 and a 10 year old and so can you tell I’ve been saying that a lot? But we know that COVID-19 has a tragically disproportionate burden on communities of color. Black Americans hospitalized at 4.5 times higher rates than whites. Hospitalization rates 3.5 times higher for Hispanics than whites and five times higher for American-Indians and Alaska natives. The fact that this virus is exploiting and exacerbating preexisting health disparities and these disparate outcomes and opportunities for health are in part the anger, the frustration and the fear that we’re seeing manifest in protests around the country. And that’s why it’s important for people to know that beyond talking about the problem at the president’s direction at secretary Azar’s direction, HHS and the white house opportunity and revitalization council or WHORC are focusing resources on minority communities.
Jerome Adams: (43:55)
HHS recently allocated $15 billion to Medicaid providers and 10 billion to safety net hospitals. Both groups of providers that disproportionately serve Americans of color. And I spent the last 10 years working at a safety net hospital, Eskenazi hospital in Indianapolis. I can tell you, those are the places that are doing the work. Those are the places that at the president’s direction we’re focusing our resources towards. We’re working with the consortium of black medical schools to fund and scale local efforts in communities that again reach communities of color.
Jerome Adams: (44:26)
CDC now requires all testing data reported by states include information on race, ethnicity and zip code so we can continue to further refine and focus our strategy on the hardest hit communities. CMS is deregulating telemedicine to make ongoing care for many medical conditions safe, accessible and convenient for the patients and for healthcare professionals. Again, we can’t afford to let people continue to go without their care and the administration’s emphasis on public private partnerships is allowing us to progress towards a vaccine and treatments at a record pace as a part of operation work speed.
Jerome Adams: (45:01)
I want to add that [inaudible 00:45:02] has just funded three community behavioral health clinics right here in Texas with the care of X funding some of your congressional representatives are here. I want to say thank you to you all for passing that into the president for signing to address COVID-19 and behavioral health needs. These facilities integrate mental health, substance abuse treatment and physical health care in one setting and provide 24/7 crisis intervention services. Another notable mental health awareness training grant is in Austin. Where funds are used to train community health officials including law enforcement. And we have many of them in the crowd today on recognizing signs and symptoms of mental illness and mental health crises and how to help an individual who’s struggling. That’s all part of reform. That’s all part of reform and the positive direction, giving our frontline workers the tools and the training they need to be able to take care of these difficult situations.
Jerome Adams: (45:52)
As mayor Sylvester Turner said at George Florida’s funeral, we must encourage business leaders to invest in our underserved communities. And that’s what the white house opportunity and revitalization council is all about. I have an upcoming surgeon General’s report on community health and economic prosperity, which aims to mobilize businesses to invest deeply in overtime in the health of their communities. Finally, to focus on chronic conditions that disproportionately impact black and Brown people, and may worsen because of COVID secretary Azar has instructed my office to accelerate the release of two calls to action. The first on maternal health. Addressing the fact that women of color suffer more complications and a much higher risk of dying around childbirth, black women are four to five times more likely to die around childbirth than white women. Native American women are more likely to die around child birth than white women.
Jerome Adams: (46:45)
And that’s after you control for income, after you control for education, after you control for every known factor that we have. My second call to action’s on hypertension control for all Americans. Hypertension is common, it’s costly and it’s treatable. And yet control rates are low installed, especially in communities of color. So I just want to close by saying that as we reopen the basic public health recommendations we’ve emphasized remain important. We’ve flattened the curve, but that doesn’t mean that COVID has gone away, that it’s any less contagious, that it’s any less deadly to vulnerable communities. So if you don’t want to listen to me, listen to hall of fame pitcher Nolan Ryan. Nolan Ryan filmed a PSA at the governor’s direction.
Jerome Adams: (47:29)
\And he said number one, wash your hands, wash them more than you’ve ever washed them before in your life. Number two, follow your local and state guidelines around social distancing. This virus likes to spread person to person. So the more we can keep distance between people especially people we don’t know the harder it is for this virus to transmit. And number three, it says it may speak and this is Nolan Ryan Hall of fame pitcher here. When you’re in a public place where it’s difficult to keep a distance like the grocery or pharmacy, the CDC recommends wearing a face covering to protect your neighbors in the event-
Jerome Adams: (48:03)
[inaudible 00:48:00] wearing a face covering to protect your neighbors in the event that you have COVID, and you don’t know it. Up to 50% of people who have COVID are asymptomatic, so thanks to the hard work of so many healthcare, and public health professionals, and the commitment of the American people. I want to reiterate, because you don’t hear this enough, that we are making huge progress in the fight against COVID-19, and as a member of the task force, I can tell you that we frequently talk about the great work Texas has been doing up until this point to keep the people of Texas safe, to keep the most vulnerable members of their community safe, and with every Americans help, with your help, Texas, we’ll keep making progress, we’re going to beat this virus, and thank you for the opportunity Mr. President. Thank you [crosstalk 00:48:42].
Donald Trump: (48:43)
Thank you very much [inaudible 00:48:44]. Ben Carson, please, man.
Ben Carson: (48:53)
Okay, well, thank you Mr. President, for your leadership and your courage. I don’t know of anybody who could stand up to all the criticism you get every day, 24 [crosstalk 00:49:04].
Donald Trump: (49:04)
Thank you.
Ben Carson: (49:14)
Our nation is continuing to a path of renewal, or recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, but since the beginning, president has talked about being a champion for the forgotten men and women of this nation. That’s exactly where we’ve been concentrating, and it’s been an honor to serve in an administration with that goal, and I’m excited to see America beginning to bounce back. The infrastructure, the economic infrastructure of our country is very strong, secondary to the abolition of multitudinous regulations, and targeted tax cuts. It’s still there. That foundation is there, and we will be able to get back on that track pretty quickly, but to help speed this rebound, the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council was formed to really help the long forgotten communities achieve economic opportunity.
Ben Carson: (50:12)
And, it has been refocused at your direction to help America’s hardest hit communities achieve economic recovery, overcome health disparities, and thrive through educational and workforce advancement. Now, to stimulate economic development and entrepreneurship, the council has worked to set aside additional payment protection funding for our nation’s low income minority communities, and provided technical support to help these communities to access this funding. They have stated that during the first round the money wasn’t getting to them. We are addressing that, and I want to thank all the different agencies, virtually, every governmental agency has contributed significantly to refocusing and addressing these problems.
Ben Carson: (51:08)
The groundbreaking initiative known as Opportunity Zones, which encourages longterm investment in the forgotten communities will also be expanded to include more of the underserved areas. Another major initiative, improving health and public safety comes with several administrative and legislative proposals. For example, we believe both telemedicine and increased use of mobile care can be major catalyst in our mission to overcome health disparities and underserved communities. Those are things that can actually be done very rapidly to bring healthcare to people who’ve previously been neglected.
Ben Carson: (51:56)
And, to further this effort, we’re also committed to reforming the infrastructure of our public health data system, addressing chronic conditions, and at risk populations, and working to address food, and security, and underserved communities. That means healthy foods at reasonable prices that are accessible, but one of the thing that I just mentioned, the data collection, we have 50 states, and we have territories in Washington, DC, and we have all of those many different healthcare collection systems, and we are working to homogenize all of that, and we’ll make it much easier for us to identify quickly health issues, and to be able to address them very quickly.
Ben Carson: (52:44)
Other legislative proposals, such as advancing national broadband access, and investment, and minority serving medical institutions will also play a major role in improving the wellbeing of these forgotten communities. Making sure that we have broadband access will give access to remote learning. We will have the possibility of taking a very best biology teacher, and instead of putting him in front of 30 students, putting in front of a million students, so that those students who’ve been neglected during all this time, and relegated to places where they’re not getting an appropriate education will be able to access those things, but to guarantee the fruits of these efforts, and that they’re long lasting, we understand the need to go forward with a longterm view through our focus on education and workforce development.
Ben Carson: (53:42)
Education and workforce development is what leads to real independence for people, and the council supports empowering disadvantaged students with dual enrollment opportunities, the creation of new short term education and career pathways, and increase access to capital for our nations [inaudible 00:54:04] use. School choice measures, presidential scholarships, and second chance Pell Grants to reintegrate formerly incarcerated individuals, are initiatives that will prove valuable investments in our country’s human capital, and we must remember these innovative new approaches in education and workforce development are nothing less than an investment in our future. We only have 330 million people in this country. Sounds like a lot of people, but compared to China, it’s a quarter of what they have, India, it’s a quarter of what they have.
Ben Carson: (54:44)
And, we have to compete with them in the future. We need to develop all of our people and education in particular played a big role in my development. I was not a particularly good student, and that’s putting it mildly. Everybody thought I was stupid, except my mother. She was always saying, “Benjamin, you can bring home much better grades than this.” But, I would agree that I could, but I didn’t, but interestingly enough, my mother studied the homes that she claimed as a domestic. She came from nothing my mother, 24 children, got married when she was 13, dire poverty, discovered her husband was a bigamous, but she was still smart enough to study those people who had these beautiful homes, and she figured that the reason they did so well it’s because they were well educated, and they read a lot, and they didn’t watch a lot of TV.
Ben Carson: (55:47)
So, she came home and imposed that on me and my brother, and we were not happy campers let me tell you. If it were today’s world we would have called social services, and they’d taken her away, but what a difference it made starting to focus on education, starting to read books, to read about people from lots of different backgrounds, entrepreneurs, and scientists, and explorers, and surgeons. I began to recognize that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you is you, it’s not somebody else, and nobody can stop you once you decide that, that is the case. And, that’s why with the council, there is so much emphasis on education, because it doesn’t matter where you came from, you get a good education, and you write your own ticket. We must reject those people who are trying to prevent school choice, who are trying to prevent the presidential scholarships, all the things that are there to empower people, and you will see a lot of that coming out of this administration, and these investments and innovation give me a tremendous amount of hope for the future of this nation. Mr. President, under your leadership, I’m confident that the American people will emerge stronger from this pandemic, and more determined than ever, and we, the people, will recognize despite all the forces to the contrary that we are not each other’s enemies and…
Donald Trump: (57:32)
That’s great. Thank you, Ben. That was pretty good. Standing over for Ben. Easiest to that, easiest to it. Great job Ben. He’s done a fantastic job [inaudible 00:58:16]. I have to tell you that. How about Scott? We’ll go quick, Scott. We’ll get [inaudible 00:58:22] Scott Turner, he’s a star. He’s a young star. Go ahead, Scott.
Scott Turner: (58:27)
Well, thank you Mr. President, and thank you for your leadership, and giving me the opportunity to shepherd the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council, and so, thank you. It’s also been a great joy to work on a daily basis with Dr. and Secretary Ben Carson, and so, Dr. Carson, thank you for your leadership, and your trust, and confidence in me. I just want to deliver some good news, along with Dr. Carson, everyone on the panel. Oftentimes, you don’t hear about the work of Opportunity Zones, but the Tax Cut and Jobs Act that the president signed into law in 2017, created the Opportunity Zone initiative, and the president created the Opportunity Zone council.
Scott Turner: (59:11)
And, that council was made up to take 18 agencies, 15 federal, and three state, and regional partners, and move in a singular motion to direct resources into our most distressed, vulnerable, forgotten communities, and it’s tremendous time, and so, our agencies on the council direct these resources. We found 270 action items to go directly into distressed communities, to help the vulnerable people of America, and we’ve built tremendous coalitions, partnerships on the ground. We’ve been to over 60 cities. I’ve been to every one of them over the last year to visit people on the ground. Education leaders, faith leaders, community leaders, business leaders, elected officials, Democrat, and Republican.
Scott Turner: (01:00:01)
See the thing about poverty, it doesn’t care what party you are. The thing about revitalization, it doesn’t care what party you are. We’re coming together as a people for the good of the community, and oftentimes, you may not hear about this, but we sit, and convene, and such as this, with all of these stakeholders at one table to have the hard conversations, what is the pain of the community? Why is the community distressed and what can we do together? Both black and white, Democrat and Republican come together for the good of this community for long term sustainability, for generational impact, and because of that, because of these partnerships, because of this collaboration together, and many people all at this table have been working together to bring about generational impact so long after we’re gone, and history tells the story.
Scott Turner: (01:00:52)
The Opportunity Zones is more than just a program. It’s more than just a concept. It is a mission that is to outlast all of us, and I tell you that as you’re here, because a lot of times people see a government program as just a checkered box. This is not a government program. This is built from the grassroots, from the bottom up to affect the people in America. Lastly, Mr. President, I would say tens of billions of dollars have been invested inside of Opportunity Zones, public, private partnerships, Erie, Pennsylvania, St. Louis, Missouri, West Dallas, right here in my great home state of Texas, and other across the nation, much money coming into our distressed communities, and I say all that to say, even though you don’t hear about it often, we have put our hand to the plow and our feet to the ground.
Scott Turner: (01:01:51)
And, all of these things were done prior to COVID, but I want you to know that right now, and post COVID that our spirit remains the same, that our heart is set, our face is set like flint. Our mission is not done, but we’re going to need all of you to pray for us, to walk with us, to convene with us, to invest, to teach. Mr. President, thank you, Dr. Carson, thank you, and to all of my colleagues at the table. Thank you for your support. It’s been a great honor.
Donald Trump: (01:02:25)
Thank you very much. That’s great. Thank you Scott. Great. [inaudible 01:02:36] you want to say something? Please pastor, please.
Pastor Morris: (01:02:39)
Well, thank you, Mr. President. I just was thinking about that 30 years ago, I was serving as associate pastor at a small church, and I asked Bishop Harry Jackson to come and teach us on race relations, to teach us what we didn’t know, because we don’t know what we don’t know, and now 30 years later, Bishop Harry and I are sitting on each side of the president of the United States.
Donald Trump: (01:03:08)
[inaudible 00:15:07].
Pastor Morris: (01:03:09)
He was concerned about healing a problem that we’ve had in our nation for a long time, but not just addressing one part of the problem, but secretary of housing, education, justice here, Attorney Gerald Barr, thank you for being here. Thank you, our great governor, Governor Abbott, and I believe that we’re going to work together, and we’re going to see freedom, and justice for all in America. Thank you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:03:43)
Thank you very much, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Great job you do here too, great job. Jeff, go ahead please.
Jeff: (01:03:51)
Thank you Mr. President. Thank you, Pastor Morris, for offering your church. I think right now, like any other time in our nation’s history we need God. I’m praying to the Holy Spirit to put words in my mouth right now, and I want a nation to hear me. We need the fear of God. Mr. President, you’re the only Republican I’ve ever voted for, and I don’t just say that to make you feel good. Honestly, that’s not my goal, man. I’m saying that because you stood up for the word of God, and as believers, as the church, we have to pray for our president and have his back. When you raised that Bible up after those folks burnt that church, we are in a spiritual warfare.
Donald Trump: (01:05:36)
Yes, you’re right.
Jeff: (01:05:47)
We cannot fight this battle with flesh and blood. We cannot fight this battle with politics. You cannot politicize oppression. I grew up right down the street. I looked at skinheads in the eye at 13 years old. My black father went to a KKK rally to protect me. I know what racism is, so when I hear words get thrown out about white supremacy, it eats me up, because these men aren’t white supremacists, that’s not what they look like. I’m telling black kids across America right now, we always hear, we don’t have black leaders. Look at this table. We are not as divided as our politics suggest, we are not as divided as our politics suggest, but I tell you what, this president, when I walk into my prisons, I’m blessed. I teach in prisons across our nation.
Jeff: (01:07:21)
Men who are broken, the most broken men in our country. Our Bible teaches us to serve those in prison, our Bible teaches us to serve the poor, and when I walk into my class, and I say, “Guys, raise your hand if you’ve gotten sentence reduced from the First Step Act.” And, every single one of them raise their hand. That’s because of you Mr. President, and that’s because of policy, but you’re brave enough to go against what everyone else has said about you. Now, I’m calling on you to do more. We have a real issue in our country, in the root of it. Let’s not get our eye off the enemy. The root of it is fatherlessness. Our kids don’t have fathers, Attorney, A. G. Barr, you said it earlier. You talked about pulling God out.
Jeff: (01:08:20)
Do we talk about education? Well 71% of those kids that drop out of high school don’t have a father in the house. We talk about criminal justice reform. You’re five times more likely to go to prison or have a run in with the police department if you don’t have a father in the house. We talk about healthcare. You’re four times more likely to live in poverty if you don’t have a father in the house, which means you’re going to be sicker. We don’t have to keep looking for the problem when we see it. Now it’s time for Americans of all color, I’m calling on my white brothers and sisters, I’m calling on my Spanish brothers and sisters, get out of your bubbles, go into the communities that are underserved, and let’s do what Jesus told us to do.
Jeff: (01:09:23)
We can bridge this gap of fatherlessnes. All we got to do is go out of our bubbles, go bridge the gap with these kids, teach them what you teach your kids. We all have rooms in our homes for a couple of little boys to come in, and play with our sons and daughters. Let’s bridge the gap through love, through Christ, and through being what we all know we are, and that’s one America, God bless America.
Donald Trump: (01:09:52)
Thank you very much. [inaudible 01:10:04]. Anybody like to speak, please? Anybody? Who goes after that? [crosstalk 01:10:18]
Will Douglas: (01:10:20)
Mr. President I’d like to speak. My name is Will Douglas. Thank you. I’m the owner of Crimson Care Pharmacy Group here in Dallas, Texas, and I’m also a Republican nominee for state representative here in Texas. First of all, I just want to thank your administration as well as Congress for getting the PPP loans. I’m speaking on behalf of my pharmacies, as well as a dozen or so other pharmacies here in the state of Texas that benefited from those, because of the PPP loans, I was able to not have to let any of my employees go, and in fact, I was able to hire additional employees, because our business model had changed overnight, no longer could customers come into our store. They were having to go through the drive through, which created a whole litany of other issues, so for that, thank you.
Will Douglas: (01:11:14)
The reason why I’m running for office is because to me, capitalism is the most important thing. Capitalism has created this bastion of free market enterprise that we have here in Texas with Dallas being the crown jewel, and I’m afraid that we’re going to lose that system that lifts people out of poverty. I was on a call with leaders in the black community here in Dallas the other day. One of them said something to me that did stuck out, and I can’t let it go, and that’s that, I think he said it was an African proverb, but that a child that is not embraced by the village will burn that village down…
Will Douglas: (01:12:03)
… embraced by the village, will burn that village down just to feel its warmth. As Republicans, we have to find ways to make capitalism embrace the people that it’s left behind. Because if we don’t, the next time it won’t just be villages and businesses that are being burned down. It will be the system that has lifted so many people out of poverty.
Donald Trump: (01:12:25)
Thank you.
Julian: (01:12:37)
So Mr. President I’ll be short. I just was going to say that thank you so much for your leadership. And I think the infrastructure that you presented today is going to help a lot of people. It’s going to touch businesses like William. It’s going to keep community safe with the partnership of these law enforcement officials and a partnership with these ministers that we have and advocates like John Ponder and Jack Brewer.
Julian: (01:13:02)
And so over the next couple of weeks, I think the American people look forward to seeing the wealth of executive orders that you are going to issue on justice and on economic empowerment. As well as legislative asks that we’re going to make to the Hill. But we all need your help, every locality, every group or organization. Because it’s really about bringing us all together. And that’s the secret ingredient. And it has to start at the local level. It starts at the local level because you are closer to the people. And we want to create that infrastructure and give you the tools to help you do what you do best. And that’s how people prosper. So thanks again, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:13:40)
Thank you Juilan. Thank you very much. Thank you Julian.
Speaker 10: (01:13:45)
Mr. President, I’d like to say thank you for putting this together, putting this together in our state of Texas. Right here in Dallas a lot has happened in the last week. I’m one of your officers here in Dallas. I’m also one of your commissioners on your law enforcement administration with Attorney General Barr. And I can’t thank you enough [inaudible 01:14:08].
Speaker 10: (01:14:07)
I also have to say thank you to our great governor and our leadership that’s sitting right there without them. They don’t make the state, they don’t make the state great. We’ve had some challenges because of what’s happened with COVID. But I want to give you an update of what we’ve done on the commission so far. Where we’ve had nine full hearings throughout this entire time, that’s 35 panels, 125 witnesses, 190 written statements from individuals and interest groups. Our civil rights and community engagement organizations that we’ve asked to attend have no showed. And those are the ones who could make the biggest difference when you’re putting together any type of reform. Because they need to be the voice to come tell us what we need.
Speaker 10: (01:14:56)
Law enforcement today is not what it was yesterday. In my 25 years, we’ve watched it propel to where our training is what we need the most. And with this commission, you’re going to see so many reforms come out of it. It could not have come at a better time. We can’t take back what happened in Minnesota. Not one officer that saw that or federal officer that saw that said that was the right thing that happened. It was malice and we can condemn it. If I could have trade places with Mr. Floyd, I would. Because I would die for everyone in this room because that’s our job. And if I could trade places with any one of those officers were there, I would have done that too. Because I wouldn’t have let that happen.
Speaker 10: (01:15:54)
And I have to say this to the citizens that we serve and the citizens that are listening. We see you. We hear you. We are with you. And we’re going to make this better.
Donald Trump: (01:16:07)
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
John Ponder: (01:16:18)
Mr. President I just want to thank you for your leadership. Echo the sentiments of some of my colleagues up here today. Thank you for your stance on criminal justice reform. Thank you for not forgetting about the forgotten people. Thank you for your commitment and your support to the men and women of law enforcement in this country and it is so so very important. My name is John Ponder I’m the CEO of a ministry called Hope for Prisoners. And what Hope for Prisoners does is we work with men, women, and young adults that are exiting different arenas of our judicial system. To provide the supportive services, to help them to be able to successfully reintegrate back into their home, back into the workplace and ultimately back into the community.
John Ponder: (01:17:03)
And Mr. President, thank you for coming out and attending the graduation ceremony for those 31 men and women who were released from prison. I cannot tell you the wind that was beneath their wings because you came and spoke life into them. And they’re on the whole new dist of life right now because of that.
John Ponder: (01:17:23)
One of the huge components, this is why I’m so supportive of your stance of law enforcement, because one of the key components to this re-entry mechanism that we built up is our partnership with the police. Our local Sheriff of Las Vegas Nevada has given us close to 100 volunteer police offices that are mentoring and training men and women coming home from the prison system. And certain never before in the history of reentry, nowhere on this planet to this magnitude had the men and women from law enforcement come alongside formerly incarcerated folks and help them to successfully reintegrate back into the community. That is just further evidence that we serve a gigantic God that wants to bridge the gap.
John Ponder: (01:18:24)
Why that is so important because what God wants to do, the Bible calls it the repairer of the breach. See in communities across our country, there’s such a disconnect between law enforcement and people from this segment of the population. But when we’re able to come up with very creative ways to bring folks together, because you think about it, all across the country, that in that disconnect, people do not trust police.
John Ponder: (01:18:51)
Do you know why? Because they’re not in relationship with them. And in what relationship could you ever have trust unless there’s life rubbing up against life in the spirit of complete transparency? That we have more in common than we have differences. And out of that transparency build a relationship and out of that relationship, it gets established trust.
John Ponder: (01:19:17)
It is something that second chance employers have absolutely fallen in love with. When you can tell the employer that the person that’s coming that just came home from prison, that the mentor is a captain of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, that begins to just open doors. So I thank you for that. Looking so very forward to the direction that we’re going. And on behalf of the men and women who are incarcerated right now and our prison system across the country, thank you for creating that atmosphere for them on the inside. But I know that you have dug the trenches to create an atmosphere for them once they get released. So I thank you for that.
Donald Trump: (01:20:06)
Thank you John very nice. Thank you very much. Very nice. Great job you’re doing John. Great job. Please.
Dr. Robin Armstrong: (01:20:10)
Thank you, Mr. President, for putting this together today. I’ve learned so much from these men and women on this stage. I really appreciate that. Thank you for, my name’s Dr.Robin Armstrong and I’m a physician. And I’ve had an opportunity to treat many, many patients with the plague from China, and with the COVID-19. And so we’ve had a lot of opportunity. Thank you so much for breaking down some of the regulatory barriers in the FDA to allow us to use medications like hydroxychloroquine.
Dr. Robin Armstrong: (01:20:42)
And to use medications like remedesivir, and plasma infusions, and all those medications are coming online now. Thank you so much for that. I have the opportunity to, we had a nursing home in South Texas that had an outbreak of, of COVID-19. And we saw a lot of nursing facilities around the country that were having horrible outcomes and many deaths. And what we decided to do was commit to this facility and use a medication that you are familiar with, hydroxychloroquine. And we saw tremendous outcomes. And it was… With the help of some of our elected officials, our Lieutenant Governor, and the State Senator, we were able to get access to those medications. But one of the more frustrating things I’ve seen has been the resistance of some of the regulatory agencies to be more open to using that. I certainly know that COVID-19 has significantly adversely affected the African American community. And I really believe that had there been more of an openness by the regulatory agencies, certainly by our medical boards all around the country to use medications like hydroxychloroquine, I believe more lives could have been saved.
Dr. Robin Armstrong: (01:22:13)
And so I really, I want to thank you for bringing that issue to the forefront. Because I believe that it did give us more access to medications. And so it was helpful for us, I believe it’s saved lives. I believe we could have saved more lives. But I just want to thank you for the work has been done. Regulations, and you’ve really broke down a lot of barriers and regulations. And in the business community, certainly I would appreciate what you’ve done on attempting to repeal Obamacare and all the efforts you’ve made towards that. That’s certainly going to improve access to care.
Dr. Robin Armstrong: (01:22:50)
And so I just want to thank you for all you’ve done. But we need to do a lot of work going forward to make sure that we minister to those who are most vulnerable. And so we really appreciate that. Thank you for all the work that Secretary Carson has done, and Secretary Azar has done, and our Surgeon General here has done. Thank you for allowing them to have the freedom to be able to innovate, and do things, and look at the data, and make decisions. And so we really appreciate that. And thank you so much. And physicians are very supportive of you. We’re really supportive of everything you’ve done to help bring this very inexpensive treatment to the forefront. And so thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (01:23:31)
Thank you very much [inaudible 01:23:32]. Appreciate it. Thank you. Please
Chief Dooley: (01:23:39)
Mr. President, thank you for this opportunity. I’m humbled to be here. I’m Chief Dooley, Glenn Heights Police department. My experience is based on serving in a large department and a small department. And I can tell you that there is some phenomenal police work being done out here, across the board, across the board.
Chief Dooley: (01:24:03)
But there’s also some inconsistencies in our procedures, our policies, our hiring practices, our termination practices, our disciplinary practices. And I strongly support the need for standardization based on best practices for all police departments in our country. I thank the President for his foresight for making these things come to happen. I know they’re coming and we need it. We are a country of very good departments, but we need to be a country of great departments. And this message today is about the transition to greatness. We have an opportunity in this country to transform the future of law enforcement. But we need to make sure that we have a relentless pursuit of dedication to public service at all times and at all levels.
Chief Dooley: (01:25:14)
Specifically national consistence policy on use of force, every chief would be in support of that. Mandatory participation and national use of force database, yes, it needs to happen. Development of national statements for discipline and termination of police officers, that needs to happen. Development of a public, a police officer de certification database. Yes, we need to be able to get those bad apples out of our industry. So what happened will never happen again.
Chief Dooley: (01:25:57)
We need to enhance the police leadership and the culture, and it starts at the top. We have some great leaders in this country, but we can always be better. We can always continuously improve. We need to implement improved recruitment, hiring, and promotion practices that are dedicated to having officers that are relentlessly pursuing the service of not the community, but our community. It’s about no, not dividing us, but uniting us and understand that we come from the community.
Chief Dooley: (01:26:34)
We need to enhance the ability for police agencies to implement effective discipline. We need to make sure that we have policies that establish a framework for a community policemen engagement, that fully embraces that police officers serve, protect and connect everyone in our community so that we all can become better.
Chief Dooley: (01:26:59)
We need training. This is not the time to defund police departments. When an organization or a business is struggling to be better now is not the time to take away those resources. You provide them, and you hold them accountable, and you set expectations and you manage them so they can be better. That’s what you do. We need more training. We need more specific training that’s dedicated to service of those that everyone we enact with on a daily basis. Those that are homeless, those that suffer from mental illness, those that need food. Okay? We need the training to be able to connect those people we interact with, with those that can provide those services. That’s what we need in this country. I want to end with just these few thoughts. I have a very simple saying to my officers that we serve protect and connect, and together is better. And as I look around this room, I know that together we will become better and we will take this country to great levels under the leadership of Donald Trump.
Donald Trump: (01:28:42)
Thank you [inaudible 01:28:29], thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, that’s beautiful. So it’s time to say goodbye. But we’ll be back, we’ll be back. And I just want to thank Bishop. You’ve been my friend for a long time, and I appreciate everything you’ve done and everything you’ve said. A great unifying source of strength and everything else and I appreciate it very much.
Bishop Jackson: (01:29:01)
Thank you. Can I add one last thing?
Donald Trump: (01:29:03)
Please.
Bishop Jackson: (01:29:03)
Before you leave?
Donald Trump: (01:29:03)
Please.
Bishop Jackson: (01:29:04)
I’m tired of people blaming the current administration and others in our generation. These problems began many years ago. And what has been exciting to me is, was a church that began the abolitionist movement. It was the church and whites and blacks working together that started the NAACP. It didn’t have a black leader at the beginning at the time. It was the church that led through in the civil rights movement.
Bishop Jackson: (01:29:38)
So I want to offer you my support in these listening sessions. In that the church needs to come together. I believe we can unify better than any group. And what we’re looking for you to do is to give structural guidance what you’re working on. And you’ve already brought forth some amazing things. But I want to affirm that Democrats can kneel down, and wear kente cloth, and stop black pain.
Bishop Jackson: (01:30:11)
Republicans can’t take some one time act and stop that black pain. But I believe we’ve got a man here who’s courageous enough-
Speaker 12: (01:30:21)
Yes.
Bishop Jackson: (01:30:22)
… to begin something that’s tough.
Speaker 12: (01:30:24)
Yes.
Bishop Jackson: (01:30:25)
And that we’re going to this time heal. And so I weep over this. I pray for you as you know.
Donald Trump: (01:30:33)
Thank you.
Bishop Jackson: (01:30:34)
And we believe that we’re going to get it right. I’m going to say one last thing, I lost of my late wife a couple years ago. I found out in dealing with her that sometimes you just got to listen, feel her pain. If you try to fix it too early, you’re going to make a mistake. Sure listening sessions are wise, because it’s going to give that cathartic process a chance.
Bishop Jackson: (01:31:08)
So I don’t want to take up too much time, sir. But I wanted to say that the people here, I challenge you. Christians, black, white, Asian, let’s come together and let’s provide a safety net. And then we’ll work with business and then we’ll work along with the administration. But don’t push them out here up front and say, “Fix it now, fix it now, fix it now, fix it now.” Because it’s never worked that way.
Donald Trump: (01:31:39)
That’s good.
Bishop Jackson: (01:31:39)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:31:49)
Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much [inaudible 01:31:46]. Fantastic job [inaudible 01:31:48] .
Donald Trump: (01:31:50)
Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"Jun 8, 2020",Uknown,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to have some of the true leaders in our country of law enforcement. And that’s what they’ve done. They’ve enforced the laws. They’ve done a fantastic job of it. We have among the best numbers we’ve ever had in terms of recorded history certainly, but this has been a very strong year for less crime. Let’s put it that way, less crime. And there’s a reason for less crime. That’s because we have great law enforcement. I’m very proud of them. There won’t be defunding. There won’t be a dismantling of our police. And there’s not going to be any disbanding of our police.
Donald Trump: (00:38)
Our police have been letting us live in peace. So we want to make sure we don’t have any bad actors in there. And sometimes you’ll see some horrible things like we witnessed recently. But 99, I say 99.9, but let’s go with 99% of them are great, great people. And they’ve done jobs that are record setting. Record setting. So our crime statistics are at a level that they haven’t been at. And I just want to go around the room and just ask each one of the folks to say hello and tell a little bit about themselves and the success they’ve had. And then we’re going to go and have a meeting as to where we go from here. Okay. Thank you. Please.
Patrick Hills: (01:22)
Mr. President, thank you. Thank you for allowing us to come today and talk about something-
Donald Trump: (01:27)
Press that button, yeah.
Patrick Hills: (01:28)
So, thank you for hosting this meeting and the ability to be able to talk about some very important things to law enforcement. This last year has been very trying to law enforcement. My name is Patrick Hills. I’m the national president of Fraternal Order Police. In the last year or actually last few months, we’ve dealt with COVID. We’ve lost 117 officers across this country who have been exposed to COVID. And I thank you for your leadership in recognizing there’s not a single thing in the law enforcement profession, when we were trying to bring hope to our communities during this pandemic that we did not receive some great assistance from your administration. So thank you for that support. But we’re dealing with another crisis now, a crisis that’s really pushing us to our limits.
Patrick Hills: (02:07)
I don’t know a law enforcement officer across this country who’s not just appalled by the incident that occurred in Minneapolis. But that one incident certainly doesn’t reflect on the 800,000 men and women across this country that go to work every single day and try and make their communities better. So thank you for the chance to have dialogue. Looking at us as a profession, we recognize that it’s time for us to have some good, deep discussion and look within and find ways to improve the criminal justice system. And I stand here to tell you that we want a seat at the table and have that discussion. So thank you for hosting.
Donald Trump: (02:40)
Thank you, Patrick, very much. I appreciate it. Ashley, please.
Ashley: (02:43)
Mr. President, thank you so much for hosting this. First and foremost, we have to ensure, before we can collaborate and make progress on areas in the criminal justice arena, we have to make sure we have space to do that in law and order controls. And we appreciate you focusing on what is important, that people have the ability to express their opinions and protest in a peaceful way, but we can not have a tax on law enforcement, looting. This will dismantle what we have built for so long. In Florida, we are at a 48 year crime rate low. We have not been this low in crime in some time. And I believe it is people like you that have supported law enforcement. And I believe in any administration, in any criminal justice system, in any state, we can always make improvements. And I admire that you are willing to dig in and have these conversations and do that.
Ashley: (03:41)
I think that moving forward, the idea that we would ever dismantle our police administrations, coming from not only as the attorney general of the great state of Florida, as a federal prosecutor or as a judge for over a decade, but as the wife of a law enforcement officer, I see what these men and women do for our communities. They rush in to save us when other people rush out. They deliver babies. They charge in when someone’s hyped up on fetanyl and just beat his wife and his kids, and rescue them. I mean, we expect great things. We have to support them. We have to ensure that they’re safe. And at the same time, we must remain committed to improving our system. And I admire that about you, president Trump, that you’re willing to do that. And we stand ready to assist you.
Donald Trump: (04:26)
Well, thank you very much, Ashley. You’re doing a great job in Florida. I get the word. You’re doing a great job. Thank you. Thank you. Please.
Rob Pride: (04:34)
Thank you, Mr. President and staff here at the white house for hosting this meeting. My name is Rob Pride. I’m the national chairman of trustees for the Fraternal Order Of Police. And I’m also here today as a Sergeant working the streets during this time of crisis in our nation. And the reason I’m so happy to be here today to represent the rank and file is because number one, it is important for everybody to know that there is not one law enforcement officer in the country that I’ve spoken to, with friends and colleagues from all over the country, that looked at this horrific incident and remotely thought that there was anything right about it. The great vast majority of men and women in law enforcement are appalled by what happened. But that vast majority is also, as the president has already said, those are the good men and women of law enforcement who work hard every day to make their community safe.
Rob Pride: (05:38)
And on behalf of that rank and file, we applaud this meeting and we’re glad to be here because there’s no doubt in anybody’s mind, as General Moody already said, that there’s room for improvement. And we know that, and we’re happy to be at the table and we’re happy to welcome that input and do what we can to be better, better police in this country, better police for our citizens in our communities. And we’re happy to be a part of this conversation, and that’s why we’re here. So, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (06:07)
Thank you, Rob. Great job. Thank you. We’ve known each other a long time now. Really good. Jared, please.
Jared Kushner: (06:14)
Thank you Mr. President, and thank you all for joining. We’ve really, over the last three and a half years, have had the opportunity to grow very close with law enforcement. We worked very closely together to bring forward to this country criminal justice reform. The law enforcement community heard the cries from the community, saw the injustices in the system that needed to be fixed and they responded by coming together to fix it. And it’s been a great partnership to do that. Those reforms make our communities safer and have made our system fairer. And that’s the type of action that we’ve been able to accomplish by working together.
Jared Kushner: (06:45)
So, what we’ve seen in the past is that the meetings together and the work together doesn’t just result in reports and nice talking points. It actually results in progress and actual policies that make people’s lives better and make communities safer. So it’s an honor to work together. And hopefully at this time where there’s a lot of people in the country who are feeling different pain and feeling different concerns, law enforcement can be a leader in coming together and helping us work towards bringing solutions that can bring this country forward. So, thank you very much for the partnership.
Donald Trump: (07:14)
Thank you, Jared. Thank you. My star.
Speaker 6: (07:18)
Thanks so much, Mr. President, and thank you to all the law enforcement individuals in the room and for the work that you do on a daily basis. When I saw what happened with George Floyd, it really made my heart sunk. It hit me to my core, as well as a lot of the other lives that have been lost. As an African American, I live in Southeast DC and live in a paradox where my wife is sometimes scared to walk the streets by herself. But then in the same vein, as an individual, I’ve also had the fear of being in certain neighborhoods or driving certain types of cars as an African American, just because of my relationship with the police. And there’s a lot of African American males across the country that have stories like that, that they can share.
Speaker 6: (08:14)
But I think law enforcement is there to kind of thread that needle and help us and protect us, and not to be demonized. And it’s been very, very tough to see what happened and what’s been impacting a lot of families across the country. But I think if we want real reform, like real reform that can change communities, it starts with law enforcement and partnering with them, not demonizing. Because I have a lot of law enforcement individuals in my life, and they’re some of the greatest people I’ve ever met. And we can’t let some bad apples represent something that’s a core of any community. And so we look forward to continuing to partner with you all to find solutions because that’s one thing I’ve learned working under president Trump’s leadership, that we’re not just about talk, we’re about action, and communities leaning on your leadership, sir, for you to take action. And it’s been a honor to serve, and I look forward to the discussion.
Donald Trump: (09:13)
Great to have you with us. Great job you’re doing too. Thank you. Please.
Speaker 7: (09:18)
Good afternoon, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. Again, thank you for putting this important meeting together. Probably one of the most important meetings in our profession in my 43 years as a law enforcement officer. And I won’t echo some of the things that have been said about the horrific incident that brought us here today. But what I will say is this. What it’s going to take to make the appropriate changes in law enforcement is courageous leadership. And there are countless courageous leaders in law enforcement across this nation that are willing to step up to the plate and look at new ideas to make our profession better in how we connect with our community. And I think one of the most important things, Mr. President, that you have done is you’ve listened to IECP and something we’ve wanted and asked for for two decades. And that’s a national commission on law enforcement in the administration of justice. And I want to thank you for establishing that because now more than ever, that commission is incredibly important. So thank you.
Donald Trump: (10:23)
That’s great. Thank you very much. Mr. VP, please.
Mike Pence: (10:31)
Thank you, Mr. President, and we’re here to listen. I want to thank the attorney generals who are here, but most especially Sergeant, Chief, others, thank you. Thanks for what you represent, which is really the best of America. I told Chief Cash Stevens that my uncle was a police officer in Chicago for 25 years. And I grew up with my three brothers and two sisters with great memories of visiting my grandparents in Chicago, seeing my uncle in his uniform, seeing him walk out the door, put his life on the line to protect and serve. And I want to promise you that you have a president, you have an administration that is always going to stand with men and women who serve, and at great risk and great sacrifice, protect our communities. I’m also though very grateful, Mr. President, to hear this afternoon a desire to have a conversation about how we can improve. As Jared just shared a moment ago, this president’s already demonstrated his willingness to improve our justice system in this country, passing historic criminal justice reform.
Mike Pence: (11:46)
And I want to express my appreciation to the law enforcement officials who are here at this table today, who were with us when brought that bipartisan legislation forward, Mr. President, at your direction. We’re always about the business of making a more perfect union. And we’re going to be about that now. In the wake of the tragic event of now almost two weeks ago, we want to hear from you about how we can improve, but improve in a way that builds on that foundation, of really the finest men and women in our country, the bravest men and women in our country, the men and women of law enforcement. How we make sure that the men and women who dedicate their lives to law enforcement, who take risks every single day to keep our community safe, are properly supported and that the resources from the federal government, and the support from state and local authorities is going to continue to hold up those honorable men and women who serve at protect every day. So thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to all of those who are here.
Donald Trump: (12:51)
Thank you, Mike, very much.
Speaker 9: (12:55)
Mr. President, it’s an honor to be here with you. Obviously I’ve been part of your team for now more than two years, taking over the Domestic Policy Council just about a month ago, but running the Office of American Innovation before that. What I want to say very briefly is this. Three months ago, on this side of the white house, we gathered almost 1,000 black leaders from around this country who were celebrating Black History Month. And in that celebration, you talked about having the lowest unemployment, the lowest poverty rate this country had ever seen. It was a remarkable feat that deserves such great celebration. But here we are three months later, and it is a different time for our country. But on Friday, we had another major announcement, two and a half plus million jobs created in a time of such darkness and destruction.
Speaker 9: (13:42)
And it reminded me that while we are in the midst of the great American comeback, while we are going to be renewing and rebuilding and restoring this country, that none of it is possible without our law enforcement, that none of it is possible without real safety and real security in this country. So really for the great American comeback, with your leadership, Mr. President, as we cut poverty rates again, and we slash unemployment again, and we build a country where every man, woman and child has a real shot at the American dream, it begins today. I believe it begins with the people in this room. It begins with a law enforcement that is supported, that is stood up and that I know you and the vice president, all of us stand beside as we move forward. So thank you so much. It’s an honor to be here.
Donald Trump: (14:28)
Great job.
Speaker 10: (14:30)
Mr. President, thank you very much. I’m really pleased to work very closely with folks like Sheriff Childress and Attorny General Cameron and Attorney General Moody, who took their time to come up here to be a part of this very important conversation. As somebody who has law enforcement in my family as well, it’s a very important conversation. And again, everybody that I’ve talked at the elected leader level, but also at the rank and file level, was just appalled by what happened in Minneapolis. But out of that comes a commitment, a redoubling to make improvement across the country at the state and local and federal level. And really pleased to have such strong partners in the Inner Governmental Affairs office to work with to help make that progress under your leadership, sir. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (15:13)
Thank you very much. Mark.
Mark: (15:17)
Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership, and thank each one of you for being here today. When the cameras are not rolling and when there’s no reporters around, there’s unbelievable work that has been going on and will continue to go on to make sure that it’s not just words, that it’s action. Mr. President, you’ve been a president of action. And for such a time as this, action, again, will speak louder than words. And all of you that are gathered around this table today, we thank you for your action to be here and for the action that will come from this. So it’s a pleasure to serve you.
Donald Trump: (15:53)
Thank you, Mark, very much.
Tony Childress: (15:59)
Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, and the administration for allowing us to sit down with you once again today. We just want you to know that you are a friend. You have been very supportive of law enforcement. As a matter of fact, I’ve been 29 years with Livingston County Sheriff’s department. Tony Childress is my name. And I am the sheriff of Livingston County, which is the fourth largest county in the state of Illinois. We’re 90 miles South of Chicago. I call it rural central Illinois, and we have an ideology that I feel and many others feel works very well. And that ideology is being a friend of the community, supporting the community with programs like shopping with the sheriff, like Halloween with the children, always being there as a listening ear for the community and working with the community. And Mr. President, we are happy to sit down with you and to try and do everything we can to make this nation better by keeping the community safe, and by working with you and the nation and making a better place.
Tony Childress: (17:29)
Some of the things that we feel in Livingston County will be very important is mandatory deescalation training for all officers, prohibition of all physical restraint maneuvers on or above the neck and any physical acts that restrict the flow of blood or oxygen to the brain, requiring all officers to render medical aid to all people, and requiring officers to intervene when physical forces are being applied to either stop or attempt forces that are being inappropriately applied and is no longer required. So, we look forward to working with you to hopefully get legislation involved in making these things true and making them law. And we just thank you again for allowing us to be here and know that you have a friend in Illinois. And anything you need, just let us know. Thank you again.
Donald Trump: (18:42)
Thank you very much. You’re doing a great job too. Appreciate it. Bill.
Bill Barr: (18:47)
Thank you, Mr. President, for convening this session. It’s good to join with all my friends and colleagues from the law enforcement community, many of whom I’ve worked with over the years. I think law enforcement fully understands and has understood for some time the distrust that exists in the African American community toward the criminal justice system. And as I’ve been reflecting on this over the past few days and weeks, it struck me that for most of our history, in fact, maybe just up to 60 years ago, the law was explicitly discriminatory and did not provide equal protection. It’s only been since the early ’60s that our law has actually provided equal protection to African Americans. And what we’ve had over the past 50 years or so is reform of our institutions so that they reflect those values, the values upon which our country was founded.
Bill Barr: (20:01)
And some institutions such as the military have done an excellent job of reforming, and law enforcement has too. That’s one thing I understand from being attorney general 30 years ago. And what makes me very optimistic today is that the law enforcement leaders that we deal with, and you all know this, no one is more committed to reforming the criminal justice system and the profession of policing today. And there hasn’t been a president recently who has been more committed. He didn’t require the crisis we have today to get started with the First Step Act and with establishing a commission, which has been looking at the very issues we’re dealing with today. And I know there’s a lot of interest among police leaders for clarity and guidance on the use of force and some of the issues you were just talking about, sheriff, making sure the standards are out there, making sure they are trained and making sure they are adhered to.
Bill Barr: (21:11)
And we’re looking forward to working with you to get that done. The time for waiting is over. It’s now incumbent on us to bring good out of bad. And we can do it. And the commitment is there in law enforcement to do it. So let’s get it done. Finally, just let me say that the other aspect of this is the rule of law and the need for law and order. Above the Department Of Justice’s main entrance is the Latin phrase that from law and order, everything else comes. It’s the foundation of civilization. And we have to make sure, it’s our responsibility to make sure that our country is ruled by law and not by violence.
Donald Trump: (22:04)
Thank you, Bill. Well said. Thank you very much. And Daniel, I got to know Daniel in Kentucky. He is a superstar in the making, if he’s not already a superstar, but he had an incredible race and we watched it together. And congratulations on that. That was some evening, right?
Daniel: (22:21)
Thank you, Mr. President, it was, and obviously was grateful for your support and grateful for your leadership on this current issue. We obviously have had the challenges with COVID-19, and now we are starting to see civil unrest in our society as it relates to some of the challenges that frankly black and brown communities have had. As general Barr so eloquently stated it, we have a responsibility in this room with all of our law enforcement partners to look for ways as we move forward to do it better, to become better citizens, to become better neighbors. And I’m so thankful for the men and women of our law enforcement community that recognize the importance and sincerity of that need and have the interest not only to protect and serve, but also to demonstrate understanding of the challenges and look for ways to heal the fabric of this nation.
Daniel: (23:17)
We, as General Barr said, can not allow for chaos in our streets. We can allow for peaceful protest, but we cannot allow for chaos. We cannot allow for violence. Those in this room that know that. Those that have been peacefully protesting know that. But our challenge today is how can we move together to better our communities, to better our society in a meaningful way? I’m honored to be a part of that discussion as somebody from the Commonwealth of Kentucky who represents Kentucky and understand some of the civil unrest that we are seeing there. So I appreciate you assembling this round table. I appreciate all of you all that are here to be a part of this conversation. And I look forward to working with you all and collaborating to better our communities and our society.
Donald Trump: (24:03)
Thank you very much. Thank you, Dan. Proud of you. So it’s a very interesting because, as you’ll see in some of the papers, they want to end the police department quote, end the police department, in Minneapolis. End it. What does that mean? End it. They had a couple of very rough nights and they had a third night which was not good. They abandoned their police precinct, something I’ve never seen before. You had a mayor that asked them to abandon. Now, they’ve abandoned the mayor, it looks like. Very… The opposite of far thinking. You say far thinking. Is that far thinking? So they had three really bad nights. And then we, I insisted on bringing in the National Guard, and all of a sudden it was like magic. It was in good shape. They helped with the police, but the police were told to leave their post.
Donald Trump: (24:55)
Nobody’s ever seen anything like that. But we insisted on having protection for that great city or that great state, great state, Minnesota. What a horrible thing. That’s where it started. And we ended very strong there once we got involved. We got involved right from the white house, and we weren’t going to let that happen to that city or that state. And I think a lot of people took notice. The police are doing an incredible job. As I said, their records are being broken in terms of lack of crime, lack of crime. We had a tremendous year, tremendous 12 months, tremendous 36 months, I think you can say during the term. Then you add six months to that. Three and a half years, it’s gone by very quickly, but we’ve had a tremendous record on crime. And we’re going to work and we’re going to talk about ideas how we can do it better and how we can do it, if possible, in a much more gentle fashion. A thing like happened should never have happened.
Donald Trump: (25:54)
And plenty of things shouldn’t have happened. But we can’t give up the finest law enforcement anywhere in the world. There’s nothing like it. Few people, few countries have our record, and I’m talking about the positive record. So we’re going to be discussing some ideas and some concepts and some things, but we won’t be defunding our police. We won’t be dismantling our police. We won’t be disbanding our police. We won’t be ending our police force in a city. I guess you might have some cities that want to try, but it’s got to be a very sad situation if they did, because people aren’t going to be protected.
Donald Trump: (26:33)
These people do a tremendous job of protecting the citizens of our country. And that’s what they’re paid for. But whether they were paid or not, that’s what they do. And somebody put it very beautifully before where they said they protect people, risk their own lives for people they’ve never seen before, people, in many cases, they don’t know. You’re protecting the lives of people you don’t know. And it’s an incredible thing. It’s a great honor to be with you all. And we’ll have a little discussion now. Thank you all very much for being here.
Speaker 15: (27:06)
President. Mr. President, can we just ask you a question? Mr. President, do you believe that kneeling is peaceful protest?
Speaker 16: (27:13)
Let’s go. Kevin, let’s go. We’re leaving. Kevin, we’re done. Let’s go."
"Jun 5, 2020",4:32 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:05)
Well, thank you very much. This is a very big day for our country. It’s affirmation of all the work we’ve been doing, really for three and a half years. This isn’t just over the last few months. This is for three and a half years. And it’s a great thing. We were very strong. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had the greatest economy in the history of the world. And that strength let us get through this horrible pandemic, largely through. I think we’re doing really well. Vaccines, by the way, I had a meeting yesterday on vaccines. We’re doing incredibly well with that. I think you’re going to have some very positive surprises. And therapeutics, likewise, we’re doing extremely well. Cures, we’re doing well. I think those two words really blend in with each other, but tremendous progress is being made on vaccines.
Donald Trump: (00:54)
In fact, we have ready to go in terms of transportation and logistics. We have over two million ready to go, if it checks out for safety. And it’s also, the nice part is we have four companies, I guess you could even say seven or eight companies, that are doing some similar and some very different on the vaccine front. And some similar and somewhat different on the therapeutic front. So tremendous progress is being made on that. And I think even without that, and I have to say, even without that, and I don’t think you’re going to be having to use that in the future, that statement, “Even without,” because I think they’re going to have it. But we’re going to be back and we’re opening our country. And I hope that the lockdown governors, I don’t know why they continue to lock down. Because if you look at Georgia, if you look at Florida, if you look at South Carolina, if you look at so many different places that have opened up, I don’t want to name all of them, but the ones that are most energetic about opening, they are doing tremendous business.
Donald Trump: (01:58)
And this is what these numbers are all about. And you have to remember one other thing. Very importantly, I think it’s extremely important for you to remember that many of our states are closed or almost closed. Some of the big ones, New York, New Jersey. They’ll start. They’re starting now to get open. I hope. And I hope that you also use our National Guard. Call me. We’ll be ready for them so fast their heads will spin. We did it in Minnesota, in Minneapolis. We were incredible. They were ripping that place apart. I love it. We had such success there. And they were ripping it apart. And I called the governor and the National Guard went in. In one night it was over. You don’t see the problem in Minnesota now at all. Not even a little bit. You take a look at a great city.
Donald Trump: (02:47)
It just great, great city, Minneapolis. And it was under siege like nobody’s ever seen. Where people are running from a police department, the great police, and they were told to. They didn’t want to run. They were told to. It’s bad, bad governing. And I’m not blaming the governor. I’m blaming the mayor. But we want to get all of this finished. This is a great tribute. What we’re announcing today is a tremendous tribute to equality. We’re bringing our jobs back. When we had our tremendous numbers. And when we had just prior to the China plague that floated in, we had numbers, the best in history for African American, for Hispanic American, and for Asian American and for everybody. Best for women, best for people without a diploma, young people without a diploma. I mean so many different categories. Our numbers were the best in almost every category.
Donald Trump: (03:42)
We had the most people working in the history of our country, almost 160 million people. We were never even close to that. So we had things that we were doing so well and then it came in, but we’re going to be back there. I think we’re going to actually be back higher next year than ever before. And the only thing that can stop us is bad policy. Frankly, left-wing, bad policy of raising taxes, and Green New Deals and all of the things that you have been writing about long and hard that will stop it like you wouldn’t believe. And frankly, it’s holding it back. If there were no possibility that that can happen, and I like to be an optimistic person, I think we’re looking very good. I think even before today, the polls that I’ve seen in the polls that we do were looking very good.
Donald Trump: (04:29)
But if we didn’t have the possibility of having massively higher taxes, like the Democrats want to do, and Green New Deals, which are totally ridiculous. Frankly, ridiculous. And I’m a big environmentalist. I believe strongly in taking care of our environment. We have the cleanest air we’ve ever had, like over the modern era. Which let’s say you go back 30 years, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water we’ve ever had. We’re setting all sorts of really good environmental records. We’re very proud of that. But the Green New Deal would kill our country. The Green New Deal would have a devastating effect on the world. And it’s not going to happen anyway, because it’s impossible for them to do it. If you ever look at what they want to do under the Green New Deal, it’s like baby talk. But we are doing something that… This was an important day because it shows that what we’ve been doing is right.
Donald Trump: (05:19)
And the reason it’s been an is so good is because the body was strong. Our body were so powerful that we could actually close our country, save millions of lives, stop people very early on from China, from coming in, because we stopped early. At the end of January, very early, people coming from China who were infected, coming into our country. That was a very hard decision to make. Nobody, almost nobody wanted me to make it. I would almost say nobody wanted me to make it. But we made that decision. And even my enemy said, that was an extremely important… We saved tens of thousands of lives with that decision. So we did a lot of things. And then we really ended up with empty cupboards. We went into a ventilator period that the likes of which nobody’s seen since the second World War, we mobilized. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.
Donald Trump: (06:18)
And then we did test, we’re over 20 million or very close, but I think we’re over 20 million tests. More than anybody in the world. Germany is at about four. And South Korea is at three and a half. We’re over 20. And by the way, when you do more testing, you have more cases. We have more cases than anybody because we do more testing than anybody. It’s pretty simple. But this is outstanding what’s happened today. Now, they thought the number would be a loss of nine million jobs. And it was a gain of almost three million jobs. Nobody’s ever seen anything. I think it was incredible in a couple of ways. Number one, the numbers are great. And this leads us onto a long period of growth. We’ll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world. Nothing close. And I think we’re going to have a very good upcoming few months.
Donald Trump: (07:08)
I think you’re going to have a very good August, very good July, but a spectacular… Maybe spectacular September. But a spectacular October, November, December, and next year is going to be one of the best years we’ve ever had economically. And if you look at the numbers, they bear it out. But we were strong. It’s sort of like when you go in for an operation, if a person is healthy, healthy, we were healthy. We had the greatest economy in the world. We went in for an operation. We closed our country down. We closed it down. We saved possibly two million, two and a half million lives. Now, it could have been a million lives. I don’t think anything less than that. But if you think we’re at 105 million today, the 105,000 today, that would mean at the lowest number, it would be 10 times that amount. And I think everybody believes the least… If we went herd, as they say.
Donald Trump: (08:05)
And if you look at Brazil, they’re having a very hard time. And by the way, they kept bringing up Sweden. It’s come back to haunt Sweden. Sweden’s having a terrible time. If we did that, we would have lost a million, a million and a half, maybe even two and a half million or more lives. So we’re at 105,000 lives. Big move, closing it up. We also closed it up to Europe. Europe became very infected from China. A gift from China. Not good. They should have stopped it. They should’ve stopped it at the source. But it’s a gift from China and a very bad gift. I will tell you that. And you do say how come at Wuhan, where it started, and they were very badly… They were in bad trouble. But it didn’t go to any other parts.
Donald Trump: (08:46)
It didn’t go to Beijing. It didn’t go to other parts of China. Then you say, “How come it came out to Europe, to the world, to the United States?” So it didn’t go to China. They stopped it cold. They knew it was a problem. But they didn’t stop it cold from coming to the United States, Europe and the rest of the world. Somebody has to ask these questions. And we’ll get down to the answer. We made a great trade deal. Great. They’re going to buy $250 billion worth of product. And by the way, they are online, they’re doing okay. But the ink wasn’t dry on that deal when the plague floated in. What’s going on? A plague is floating in from China. What’s going on? So the ink wasn’t dry. So I guess I viewed the trade deal a little bit differently than I did three months ago.
Donald Trump: (09:34)
It’s a great deal. I will say they are buying a lot from us. And in that way, I respect. And getting along with China would be a good thing. I don’t know if that’s going to happen. I’ll let you know. We’ll let you know. I think they want to get along very much with us. But we built a tremendous thing, a tremendous power platform. So when it got ill, when we had a problem, we were able to cut it off, stop it, just like this. Stop it. Keep everyone inside, keep them away, keep them together, away, uninfected. And we saved millions of lives. And now we’re opening and we’re opening with a bang. And we’ve been talking about the V. This is better than a V. This is a rocket ship. This is far better than a V. A V is wonderful. A V is this. They were talking about, will it be a V, a U, an L? They had no idea.
Donald Trump: (10:29)
And I was watching one of the shows, and I have great respect for the people. And they said, “Will it be nine million in job losses? What will the number be? Are they going to report record numbers? Will we break 20%? What will the number be?” And I don’t know, because we were in, and I don’t think we’re in that territory anymore. We were in unchartered territory. Nobody’s ever had a situation like that. So the number was nine million, and one of the people was going, “No, no. I think it’s going to be 10 million.” That’s 10 million negative, losses. And then somebody else said, “No, we think it’s going to be 8.7, 9.2.” Everyone was right around that number. This is… Great geniuses. And they are. I watch them all the time. And oftentimes they’re right.
Donald Trump: (11:18)
Warren Buffet sold airlines a little while ago. He’s been right his whole life. But sometimes even somebody like Warren Buffet, I have a lot of respect for him. They make mistakes. They should have kept the airline stocks, because the airline stocks went through the roof today. And others did too. The whole market went through the roof. But they said nine million, nine million job losses, nine million. It’s what it’s going to be. Are we going to break 20%? Are we going to break it? And then the numbers came in and one of the folks that was reading the numbers said, “Wow, this is a great number. It’s only three million job losses.” And then reading it and say, “I don’t think I’m not reading this right. Let me look at it again. Wait a minute. This is three million gain almost.” Three million jobs gained. And then they shouted out, one of them, sort of semi shouted out. “Is this a typo?” I think it was probably the greatest miscalculation in the history of business shows.
Donald Trump: (12:21)
In the history of business shows talking about Wall Street. And that’s okay. But one of the reasons we’re in this position is because we had such a strong foundation. So we were able to close our country, save millions of lives, open, and now the trajectory is great. Don’t forget. New York is barely included. And that’s one of our big ones. California is barely included, because they’re not open. And they should open. By the way, the mayor of Los Angeles wants to keep this thing closed for a long time. Look at what’s going on in Florida. It’s incredible. The job the governor of Florida has done. It’s incredible. The numbers they’re doing, you’ve got to open it up. And you do social distancing and you wear masks if you want.
Donald Trump: (13:05)
And you do things, you can do a lot of things. You’re getting closer together. Even you. I notice you’re starting to get much closer together. It looks much better, I must say. You’re not all the way there yet, but you’ll be there soon. But it’s a tremendous thing that happened. And the reason it happened is because we had a really strong patient. We had a patient that was so powerful, so strong, that we could close it and open. And I give it this analogy. Somebody told me yesterday, it was Larry Kudlow.
Donald Trump: (13:32)
He said, “Sir, this is like a hurricane.” And we were worried. We didn’t know, is this going to be a hurricane or a major, major recession? A major recession that’s not artificially caused, because this was artificially closed. We just said, “Boom. Closed.” And everything just stopped. And also, you know what else stopped? Big numbers on death, by doing it. And that’s why I had to do it. We’ve made every decision correctly. But, it was like we stopped. So it was an artificial-
Donald Trump: (14:03)
Correctly. But it was like we stopped. So it was an artificial closing. And then what happened very incredibly is the numbers go. And Larry was saying that with a hurricane, you have a horrible hurricane in Florida or Texas, and it’s devastating. And then the hurricane goes away and within two hours, everyone’s rebuilding and fixing and cleaning and cutting their grass. I’ve seen it in Texas. I’ve seen it everywhere. I’ve seen it everywhere. Texas had a massive one, Louisiana, hurricanes, Florida hurricanes. But what happens is right after the hurricane, boom, and this is what this is, this isn’t a terrible recession. I don’t even mention the D word. I don’t talk about the D word, I don’t want to talk about it, because every time somebody even mentions it, I don’t like the D word. But if you had a really, really big, bad recession, it could take 10, 12. How long did it take in 1929? It took many years to recover from that. How long?
Speaker 1: (15:07)
10 years.
Donald Trump: (15:08)
10? I heard 10, I think, longer than 10, but that’s okay. I heard 14, 15 years. Larry says 10, so let’s go with 10. But it takes a long time to recover, but a hurricane you’re back in business in one day, two days, three days, and it’s devastating and it’s hard. And this was a hurricane. And it’s going to get better fast because a lot of the numbers that you see, they’re early numbers. They’re not even from this last month.
Donald Trump: (15:35)
And by the way, speaking of that, you had the greatest 50 day rally in the history of our exchanges, the greatest 50 day rally. And we have a lot of protestors and we have something else. We have something else. We have a pandemic, we’ve made tremendous progress really on both if you look at where we’ve come on, both, we’ve made tremendous progress on both, tremendous progress. But you’re looking and the people are now starting to return to work.
Donald Trump: (16:11)
So it’s been an incredible thing to see. It’s been a beautiful thing to see. The experts predicted that the economy would lose tremendous numbers of jobs, and of course from the beginning, it has, but you’re going to see how fast that’s made up. I’m telling you next year, unless something happens, where the wrong people get in here, this can turn around, your 401ks will go down to numbers. If people didn’t get rid of stocks and their 401Ks, they’re almost even, think of it. With a pandemic, and with one of the worst things that’s ever happened, our country has never lost 105,000 people. Whether it’s world trade center, which was 2,900 or Pearl Harbor, which was less than that, we’ve never lost anything close to this, but it’s not only our country, it’s the whole world. The world is suffering so badly, 186 countries at this moment. And that affects us too.
Donald Trump: (17:14)
But we’re a positive force. We are the key to the world in a sense, and the fact that we’re doing well, I see already, they’re starting to do much better in other parts of the world. That’s a great thing because we’re working with the world and we’ll work with China too. We’ll work with everybody. But what happened should have never happened.
Donald Trump: (17:32)
So we had a tremendous morning, a tremendous announcement. It was shocking to even great pros. I watched Maria Bartiromo, I watched Jim Kramer, I watched a lot of people, Joe Kiernan. He was pretty positive. Charles Payne, he was very positive for a long time. A lot of people got it right. They had confidence in me. They had confidence in this team and they got it right. I think that’s the only thing they could base it on because we were an unchartered territory.
Donald Trump: (18:03)
I like to just say that renewal, restoration or recovery of the most vulnerable areas of America is going to be my focus, it’s going to be a big focus because it’s taking care of itself, but we have to help that very vulnerable area, the vulnerable. It’s not right. And we’re helping them, and we have helped them in the past. They were all sent to opportunity zones, criminal justice reform, nobody’s ever done for the black community what president Trump has done. Think of it. Historically, black, small colleges and universities, they would come here for money every year, every year for many, many years. After three years, I said, “Why are you doing this? Why do you keep coming here?” They said, “Because we come,” I said, “Don’t you get a longterm deal so you don’t have to come?”
Donald Trump: (18:55)
The head of one of the very respected colleges looked at me and said, “Sir, we’re like beggars. Every year we have to come to Washington and beg for money.” I said, “You should have a longterm deal.” And we signed a longterm deal so they don’t have to come. I’ll miss them, I told them I miss them, I got to know them. But the first year, I didn’t think anything of it, the second year I said, “That’s strange. Why you here?” And then the third year, not so long ago, same people, the heads of the historically black, small colleges and universities, 44 people, maybe a little more than that. Little less than that sometimes. But after three years I said, “What are you doing?” They said, “The past administration did nothing for us. The administration before that did nothing for them.” So I’m going to do it.
Donald Trump: (19:45)
So we did the opportunities zones with Senator Tim Scott. It has been fantastic. And by the way, it’s one of the great unknowns, because the opportunity zones you don’t talk about, it’s one of the most incredible stories ever in terms of the inner cities and in terms of black and Hispanic and Asian unemployment opportunities, as you ought to do some stories about opportunity zones. Billions and billions of dollars of private money is being invested in putting people to work and getting money that they’ve never made before.
Donald Trump: (20:17)
So it’s been a really a terrific thing. It’s now time for us to work together as we rebuild, renew and recover the great promise of America, and that’s true, we’re going to work together. It’ll all work out. It’ll all work out. Some governors may need a little help yet, but I think for the most part, they are in good shape.
Donald Trump: (20:35)
We have a fantastic military. We have fantastic national guard. National guard was barely used and these people have done an unbelievable job. They helped the secret service at Washington. Secret service by the way, are unbelievable. The job they did at the white house is unbelievable. There was never any form of like, “Oh gee, this sounds dangerous.” All I could see is what I was seeing on television. But they were outside. And the secret service was incredible, but we were also helped by the DC police and we were helped by the national guard was unbelievable. They came in and they… This was like a piece of cake.
Donald Trump: (21:13)
And I really am suggesting because if you look at Minnesota and the great success we had there, and other places, I’m suggesting to some of these governors that are too proud in New York, you see what’s going on there. Don’t be proud, get the job done. You’ll end up looking much better in the end. Call in the national guard, call me. We’ll have so many people, more people than you have to dominate the streets. You can’t let what’s happening happen. It’s called dominate the streets. You can’t let that happen in New York where they’re breaking into stores and all of the things. And by the way, hurting many small businesses, you can’t let it happen.
Donald Trump: (21:50)
Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender or creed, they have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement. They have to receive it. We all saw what happened last week. We can’t let that happen. Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying, “This is a great thing that’s happening for our country.” This is a great day for him. It’s a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great, great day in terms of equality. It’s really what our constitution requires and it’s what our country is all about.
Donald Trump: (22:38)
I just want to finish by saying, to save the economy, we passed several pieces of critical legislation, totally many trillions of dollars meaning three. We’re set up to do more if we want. I think we should, because we are dominant. For many years as a bystander, but somebody that loved government, somebody that loved this country, I would watch and study and see, when I say study, naturally study by watching. But if you go back, China was going to catch us in 2019. And that was like a given. You go back five years, six years, seven years, it was always, yeah, China will catch America, catch the United States in 2019, and then it will become the dominant economy. Never happened. It’s not going to happen.
Donald Trump: (23:29)
We dominated them over the last year and a half, two years, we took in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs that they paid for. I gave some of that money, just a small fraction to our farmers, which made them whole, more than whole. That’s why they’re all in business, made them more than whole. And it came right out of the tariff money. And the reason we didn’t pay is because China devalued their currency and they paid. Plus they also put additional money to it, because if they didn’t do that, nobody would have bought that product. We made a great deal because of that. That’s the only reason we’re able to make a good deal, because of the possibility of tariffs, because China’s taking tremendous advantage of the United States. We helped rebuild China. We gave them $500 billion a year. How stupid, how stupid are the people that represented our country with China and many other countries? But that’s all changing. And it was in the process of changing very big. Again, China had a very bad year before the plague and now I think hopefully, they’re going to have a great year. I want them to have a great year, but we’re going to have better years than they ever had. We have a better system, much better system.
Donald Trump: (24:45)
We made Americans sure. Of themselves and we took care of families, we gave benefits and we set $1200 to every individual making less than $75,000 and $4,000 almost to every family of four earning less than 150,000. That’s a lot, isn’t it? When you think 150, but that’s what’s happening with our country. If you look at other countries, even countries that you think they’re doing well, they don’t talk about 150,000 as being median. $150,000, that’s tremendous. That’s a great tribute to the people of our country.
Donald Trump: (25:26)
The job surge that we’re seeing right now is widespread. Leisure and hospitality added 1.2 million jobs. Construction jobs are up, listen to this, 464,000. Education and health services road is 424,000. Retail trade is up 368,000. And here is the one I liked the best, remember previous administration that you need a magic wand for manufacturing. Manufacturing, which we had up to 600,000 jobs, prior to the plague manufacturing rose to 225,000 jobs, up by. So we picked up 225,000 manufacturing jobs. That’s very unexpected.
Donald Trump: (26:15)
Everything that you’ve seen this morning is unexpected. Even the pros sitting here would understand that, everything. We also smashed expectations on the unemployment rate. The prediction was that the unemployment rate would rise to over 20%, and instead of drop to around a little more than 13%, slight difference. And this time the greatest come back in American history today is probably if you think of it, the greatest comeback in American history, but it’s not going to stop here. It’s going to keep going because so many places are closed.
Donald Trump: (26:50)
I was watching a great vice-president today being interviewed on CNBC, he did a phenomenal job and he, he made a statement. He said, “This is not going to stop,” and a hundred percent, he’s always attributing everything to me, but I’ll attribute this statement to him. He said, “It’s not going to stop because the numbers that you’re looking at don’t include all of those States that are closed, they haven’t even opened yet.” We’re going to be stronger than we were when we were riding high. And our stock market is almost, it’s just short of an all time high.
Donald Trump: (27:23)
I’ve had 144 all time, high stock markets during a three and a half year period. Nobody’s ever come close to that and we’re going to do it again, but it’s going to be even stronger than last time.
Donald Trump: (27:36)
When I would say that to you, two, three months ago, I could see what’s happened. I have a good feeling, I’ve always done well with numbers, but I had a feel for it. I said it even the other day, I was saying, “I think we’re going to have a tremendous next year. I think it’s going to be a phenomenal next year.” I didn’t know it would start this quickly. I thought we’d start in August, September, but it started very early. It’s an amazing thing, but it means that they’re likely to return and all of these jobs that we’re talking about…
Donald Trump: (28:03)
… to return. And all of these jobs that we’re talking about now aren’t even included, because some of our biggest places aren’t opened. They’re opening up now. I think New York’s opening up as of today, and that’s one of our big ones. New Jersey. They’re all working hard, the governors are all working hard. To save millions of American lives, we took that unnecessary evil … we took it out of the equation. We had to do what we did. We had a very, very strong push not to do anything. We would have lost so many people. But very importantly, the economy wouldn’t have been as good as it is, because nobody expected this. I don’t think there’s anybody sitting here that can say, I want to see it on tape, as opposed to just saying, “Oh, I did that.” But some were predicting pretty good numbers, like people I mentioned. But we took a tremendous step and a tremendous risk, and we’ve gone up at a level. And this level is going to be nothing compared to what you see in coming months, and especially next year.
Donald Trump: (29:05)
So the best strategy to ensure the health of our people moving forward is to focus our resources on protecting high-risk populations, like the elderly and those in nursing homes, while allowing younger and healthier Americans to get back to work immediately. And open up our schools, open them up. We understand this disease now. We didn’t understand it. Nobody’s ever seen it before. It’s very tough, very contagious, very [ inaudible 00:29:30]. We’ve learned a lot we didn’t know. Nobody knew anything about it, but we learned a-
Donald Trump: (29:35)
(silence)
Donald Trump: (29:35)
… and this entire-
Donald Trump: (29:35)
(silence)
Donald Trump: (39:02)
… take care of our vets. We got choice-approved for the vets. So instead of waiting in line for four weeks to see a doctor, they can go immediately outside, get a private doctor, we pay for the bill, and the vet is in great shape. We actually save money, but more importantly, we save their lives, and we save the quality of their life. They were dying. They would come onto a line, they’d have to wait four or five weeks, they wouldn’t be very sick. By the time they see the doctor, they’d be terminally ill. We don’t have that anymore. You don’t hear any bad stories about the vets anymore. That doesn’t mean go out and find them, because tonight you’ll be traveling all over the world looking for an unhappy event.
Donald Trump: (39:39)
And we got accountability, because we had a lot of bad people in the VA. It’s called VA Accountability, where we can now fire people that don’t treat our vets good. We have sadists, we have thieves, we have a lot of bad people. And we can now … it’s called VA Accountability. Almost 50 years, they’ve been trying to get it. Choice, almost 50 years, they’ve been trying to get it. For many, many years. I’ve been hearing about it for years. They’ve been trying to get VA choice. Choice means you can have a choice of a doctor. You don’t have to wait in line if you have a long line. I have to say, the VA has great doctors, but you can’t get to them very quickly. Now they go outside and they take care of themselves.
Donald Trump: (40:18)
So we’ve had a great morning. This is just the beginning. It’s going to be incredible. I’m going to sign our very important piece of legislation. Again, thank you very much to the Democrats. And then we’re going to have a couple of words by a few of the people standing alongside of me. I want to thank them so much. And we’ll talk to you soon.
Speaker 2: (40:40)
Mr. President, what happened to the plan for systemic racism? Mr. President, why haven’t you laid out a plan to address systemic racism?
Donald Trump: (40:47)
I’d like to sign this bill. This is a very different thing. And by the way, what’s happened to our country, and what you now see that’s been happening, is the greatest thing that can happen for race relations, for the African-American community, for the Asian-Americans, for the Hispanic American community, for women, for everything.
Speaker 2: (41:08)
What’s your plan?
Donald Trump: (41:08)
Because our country is so strong, and that’s what my plan is. We’re going to have the strongest economy in the world. We almost are there now. We had the strongest economy anywhere in the world, and now we’re going to have an economy that’s even stronger.
Speaker 3: (41:23)
Sir, how would a better economy-
Donald Trump: (41:26)
Excuse me, I’d like to sign this.
Speaker 3: (41:26)
Yeah. Just to follow up, how would a better economy have protected George Floyd?
Donald Trump: (41:31)
Excuse me, do you mind if I sign this?
Speaker 3: (41:31)
Sure, I’ll ask after.
Speaker 4: (41:31)
Will you take questions after, sir?
Speaker 2: (41:33)
Black unemployment went up by .1%. Asian-American unemployment went up .5%. How is that a victory? How is that a victory?
Donald Trump: (41:41)
You are something.
Speaker 2: (41:43)
How is that a victory?
Donald Trump: (41:44)
Ah, thank you very much. I have to say though, it’s been an honor. This is such a great achievement. Feel so good about it. This is jus the beginning, the best is yet to come. Mike, would you say a few words, please?
Donald Trump: (42:02)
Mike, would you say a few words please?
Mike Pence: (42:04)
Well, thank you, Mr. President. And today’s a great day for America. The American comeback begins today. And Mr. President, it is a tribute to the strong decisions that you made early on to put the health of America first, from suspending all travel from China to calling on the American people to embrace the kind of mitigation practices, to practice social distancing, to endure 45 days to slow the spread. The way you worked in a bipartisan way, we want to thank members of both parties in the Congress for working with us to provide relief for families, small businesses, and enterprises across the country. Today’s numbers, historic as they are, are a testament to the leadership that you’ve provided, Mr. President, on mitigation, on recovery, and as you directed the White House coronavirus task force. They’re also a tribute to the fact that states across the country, now all 50 states are reopening our country.
Mike Pence: (43:12)
Even before we came to the end of the 45 days, you directed us to give guidance to state governors and all the States and territories to safely and responsibly reopen. And now all of our states are in the process of doing that. It’s remarkable to think that two and a half million jobs and declining unemployment number actually dates to surveys done in mid-May. Mr. President, it’s remarkable that we can see all across the country that this is a snapshot today of the comeback that was taking place the better part of a month ago. But because of the guidance you gave to the American people in mitigation, and because of the recovery efforts that bipartisan members of Congress supported at your direction. And ultimately because we are reopening the country, we’ve begun a great American comeback.
Mike Pence: (44:02)
So I want to thank you, Mr. President. I want to thank members of Congress that were with us. I join you in thanking all of the incredible healthcare workers across the country, including our team on the task force and health officials at every level, governors that have been our partners. But ultimately, today is a tribute to the American people. Mr. President, I know that you’ve said again and again this morning that it was because the patient was strong in the beginning, because the policies that you put into place to cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleash American energy, fight for free and fair trade. We created more than 7 million jobs. And today, the strength and resilience of the American people is shining through. And this is their day. Congratulations America, the comeback begins.
Donald Trump: (44:50)
Thank you, Mike. And I think, very importantly, because it’s a great state and you have so many great states involved with energy, but we had basically a disaster just a month ago. We had a disaster with respect to energy. It was down to zero. It was worthless. And that’s 5 million jobs, maybe much more than that indirectly, probably close to 10 million jobs. Energy jobs in Texas and North Dakota and Oklahoma, and many other states, New Mexico, great state, great energy state it’s become. And we saved that industry in a short period of time. And you know who helped us? Saudi Arabia and Russia. And then we got Mexico to do what they really had to do. And I want to thank the president of Mexico. He was terrific, in the end, he was terrific.
Donald Trump: (45:39)
But we saved the energy industry. That would have been catastrophic to lose it. And now it’s up to almost $40 a barrel. And people would have said, “That’s impossible.” But we got Saudi Arabia, Russia and others to cut back very substantially. OPEC-Plus, we call it OPEC-Plus. But they were the leaders. And we appreciate that very much. Could I ask Kevin and Larry to say a few words, please?
Larry Kudlow: (46:07)
Thank you, sir. I’ll be brief as I can. I know it’s pretty darn hot.
Donald Trump: (46:15)
I haven’t noticed that. Is it hot? Nobody hot.
Larry Kudlow: (46:17)
You’re pretty good at it. So preceding this number were a number of green shoots, as we call them in economics or finance. And as the President has mentioned, things like Apple Mobility, traveling indexes, the housing applications for new homes are skyrocketing, new businesses and new business applications are skyrocketing. So we’ve seen a lot of pieces of evidence. The key to today’s number, 2.5 million payrolls and 3.8 million households from which the unemployment comes, the key is that those who were temporarily laid off have gone back to work. Three million some odd. And that’s because of the reopening, and that’s because of the success of the President and Vice President’s mitigation policies, which had to be taken. Now the reopening begins.
Larry Kudlow: (47:09)
Here’s a footnote. At May 12th, for the week the survey was taken, a little less than 50% of small businesses had reopened. According to the Chamber of Commerce, the most recent number in late May, early June, 80%, 79% of small business have reopened. So we’re going to see more continued progress in the June jobs numbers when they come out. And I want to add also, my friend and colleague, Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s leadership on the Payroll Protection Program has kept people on temporary call, have kept them furloughed, but they knew they were going to come back. The PPP has distributed $510 billion and has probably saved as much as 50 million jobs. And overall, we’ve extended tax rebates and other payments, 159 million Americans for nearly $275 billion. The rescue package works. It was the largest in American history. Now we are seeing weekly unemployment claims coming down, continued claims coming down, the 13.3% unemployment rate has come down.
Larry Kudlow: (48:19)
And I think as the President has noted, these trends will continue. This was a sharp, tough, heartbreaking pandemic contraction. It’s not a typical economic contraction. It was like a bad hurricane or a bad snow storm. There’s a lot of heartache in that. And there’s a lot of hardship in that. Absolutely. But they’re sharp and fast and they recover fast. And we are beginning to see this rapid recovery, which I believe will extend well into the third quarter and the fourth quarter. We’re still looking for some 20% economic growth in Qs three and four, and a big number in 2021 as we move forward with presidential policies of lower taxes and regulations and energy and fair and reciprocal trade deals that created a phenomenal economy before the pandemic and can recreate and rebuild that phenomenal economy afterwards. I bring in my great pal, Kevin Hassett.
Kevin Hassett: (49:18)
Thank you. Good job. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. And today is a historic day. But as you remind us, there’s still a lot of work left to do. That there were 18 million people that said that they expected to be reemployed. 3 million of them came back and it shocked economists that it happened so fast. But there’s still a lot of work to do. And that’s what you’ve instructed us to do is to give you options so that we can get everybody else in the country back to work.
Kevin Hassett: (49:44)
And I think that the main economic lesson I take from what we’ve seen, in addition to Secretary Mnuchin’s incredible work getting the programs enacted quickly, is that the Vice President’s leadership with the task force, right at the very beginning, you put out guidance for businesses and for governors about how to open safely. And because the guidance was so scientifically based, people did so with confidence. And you would never have a jobs number like what we saw today without the confidence that I think was generated by your leadership, Mr. Vice President, and Dr. Birx and the rest of her team. So thank you so much for your service, sir. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (50:19)
Thank you very much. I just want to add, we’ll be going for a payroll tax cut. We think that’ll be incredible in terms of what we’re doing, because again, we’re going to be bigger, stronger, better than we ever were. That’s going to be a tremendous incentive for businesses and also a great incentive, and maybe to me, most importantly, for the workers. So we’re going to be asking for a payroll tax cut. We’ll be asking for additional stimulus money because once we get this going, it’ll be far bigger and far better than we’ve ever seen in this country. That includes as of three or four months ago when everyone thought it was great and it was great.
Donald Trump: (50:54)
And we’re going to be doing things for restaurants and various pieces of the entertainment industry, which will be an incentive, whether it’s deductions or whatever. But Steve Mnuchin’s going to be working on that because the restaurants will be a little bit harder to come back. Although I must tell you, Mike, I’ve seen some tremendous numbers from restaurants. But we’re looking at doing something in terms of an incentive with taxes. It could be deductions, it could be something else. But we’ll be announcing it pretty soon, but we will be asking, despite the numbers and how good they are, because we will be so far ahead of everybody else if we do what we’re doing, our borrowing cost now is zero. So we’re paying no interest, which is very good. And I just want to thank everybody. I’d like to ask Steve Mnuchin to say a few words, please.
Steve Mnuchin: (51:42)
Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. And again, I want to especially thank the Senate and the house for working with us in another example of overwhelming bipartisan support that is helping American business and American workers. Mr. President, this legislation is a direct result of you invited in leaders from the restaurant industry and the hotel industry. These are two areas that have been especially hard hit. The restaurants’ number one ask was extending the PPP for 24 weeks and this legislation delivers on this. So it is great to see the $500 billion that we’ve put to work in small business make its way into the economy. And now you see it in these numbers and then bringing more people back to work. So not only did this save jobs, but we now see people coming back to work and we look forward to working with Congress on bipartisan issues to make sure we get every American back at work that was unfortunately laid off as a result of this virus. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (52:43)
Thank you very much."
"Jun 3, 2020","THE PRESIDENT:  We’re here this morning to announce dramatic action to support our nation’s farmers, ranchers, and growers as we work to safely re-open America.  And it’s happening very fast — much faster and with much better numbers than anybody would have thought.","Brian Kilmeade: (00:00)
Here’s the President of the United States. Mr. President, thanks so much for joining us from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
President Donald Trump: (00:06)
Well, thank you very much, and congratulations on 10 years on radio. Wow, that’s pretty good. I remember when you were one day on radio. It’s been a long time, but that’s great job. You’re doing a great job, Brian.
Brian Kilmeade: (00:18)
You were hosting… Thanks, so much, Mr. President. You were hosting The Apprentice back then. You were number one-
President Donald Trump: (00:23)
That’s right.
Brian Kilmeade: (00:23)
… in the ratings when we started-
President Donald Trump: (00:24)
That’s right.
Brian Kilmeade: (00:25)
… and I got the number one job in the country. I just was curious, the place you used to live where the mayor, Mayor de Blasio, the National Guard is not going to work here. They’re not trained to handle unrest. Do you agree with that?
President Donald Trump: (00:39)
No. Not at all. If you look at what happened in Minnesota, they were getting decimated, and after three days of watching it, I demanded that the National Guard be utilized, and in one day, it was over. In fact, they got there at a certain time in the late afternoon, and by the time they finished, it was, I always say a somewhat sarcastically, but the safest place on earth to… and Minnesota was really, really having a hard time, and we took care of it. The governor is a nice man, and he was not using enough, and he was… You saw the police were running in Minneapolis, and they were running away from their precinct, which is something I’ve never seen before.
President Donald Trump: (01:18)
You have a liberal mayor that, frankly, was having a lot of trouble, and you have a very liberal mayor in New York too. Do you notice that all of these places that have problems are not run by Republicans, they’re run by Liberal Democrats, so there is something into that philosophy, and yet they’re also the ones keeping everybody locked up in their apartments and their homes for too long a period of time, so it’s very interesting how that changes, but no, the National Guard, we could solve that problem in New York, and in fact, if they don’t get their act straightened out, I will solve it. I’ll solve it fast.
Brian Kilmeade: (01:52)
Last night was one of the best nights in day eight, especially in New York. We didn’t see the riots. We saw the protests. Even though it wasn’t perfect, do you think we’ve turned the corner according to the reports you get?
President Donald Trump: (02:05)
Well, you may, but you still had a lot of people, and they’re violent people in many cases. You have protesters, but you also have anarchists and looters. A lot of people that are bad people. A lot of bad people. We have a lot of proof and information and proof. You’ll be seeing it in time to come where they’re delivering rocks and stones to certain locations and dumping them, so they have… That’s their ammunition, and that hurts people very badly, including National Guard people or even military people.
President Donald Trump: (02:41)
But Washington is in great shape. We called out the National Guard after the first night, which was a little bit rougher, but then after that, we called up, and we have, I jokingly said, a little bit jokingly maybe, it’s one of the safest places on earth. We had no problem all last night. We had substantial dominant force, and we have to have a dominant force. Maybe it doesn’t sound good to say it, but you have to have a dominant force. We need law and order.
Brian Kilmeade: (03:11)
Sunday wasn’t the case. We had Leland Vittert reporting no problem. It got dark, a huge problem. He was attacked. Then the reports were, they were so worried, they brought you downstairs in the White House to a bunker. What could you tell me Sunday night was like for you and your family?
President Donald Trump: (03:27)
Well, it was a false report. I wasn’t down. I went down during the day, and I was there for a tiny little short period of time, and it was much more for an inspection. There was no problem during the day. The problem, I saw Leland got whacked pretty good, but that was during the night. This problem, these problems are during the night, not during the day. I go down, I’ve gone down two or three times all for inspection. You go there… Someday you may need it, but you go there, and I went down, I looked at it, it was during the day. It was not a problem. I read about it like a big thing.
President Donald Trump: (04:06)
There was never a problem. We never had a problem. Nobody ever came close to giving us a problem. The Secret Service does an unbelievable job of maintaining control in the White House, and beyond the Secret Service, we have a lot of other great people out there, including the DC Police, and then of course, on top of that, after I saw the one evening, which was a little rough, and it was certainly a rough on Leland I think more so than anybody else, we brought in the troops.
Brian Kilmeade: (04:38)
Mr. President, I remember 9/11 that President Bush wanted to land back at Washington. They wouldn’t let him. They said, “It’s too dangerous.” Finally got it back there. Sometimes the Secret Service even tells the president, “I can’t do this.” You telling me, Mr. President, they didn’t say to you, “You have to go downstairs. My responsibility’s your welfare.” They didn’t limit you at all in the House?
President Donald Trump: (04:59)
Nope. They didn’t tell me that at all, but they said, “It would be a good time to go down, take a look because maybe sometime you’re going to need it.” I’ve been down, let’s see, that would be number two, two and a half sort of because I’ve done different things, but two and a half, but I looked, I was down for a very, very short period of time, very, very short period of time. I can’t tell you who went with me, but a whole group of people went with me as a inspecting factor.
President Donald Trump: (05:28)
I was back up, and Brian, it was during the day. It wasn’t during the night. I think they reported during the night. During the night, maybe someday it makes sense. During the day, you have tremendous numbers of people. We didn’t even have protesters, or if they did, it was a small crowd. There’s so much fake news going around, Brian, you have no idea. Maybe you do actually have an idea.
Brian Kilmeade: (05:51)
Mr. President, you gave a speech in the Rose Garden, got a thumbs up for a lot of people, especially your supporters, and then you said, “I’m going to go to a very important place,” and they quickly cleared out Lafayette Park, and you walk through with many of your staff, from Kayleigh McEnany to the Secretary of Defense who said he didn’t know where he was going at the time, and you appear to St. John’s Church, which was boarded up and you held up a Bible. Reverend James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of a book on that church says, “The church is not a photo op, that religion is not a political tool, and God is not a play thing.” He’s among some religious leaders who were very critical of that visit. What’s your response?
President Donald Trump: (06:33)
Well, my response is simple: Most religious leaders loved it. I heard Franklin Graham this morning thought it was great. I heard many other people think it was great. It’s only the other side that didn’t like it, the opposition party as the expression goes. They burned down the church the day before. I heard how nice and wonderful the protesters were over there.
President Donald Trump: (06:53)
Really? Then why did they burn down the church today before… They burned down a big section of it. Fortunately, they were able to catch it in time. This is a church built at a similar time as the White House. Madison was your president. He was number six, I believe. Madison was your president, and he was the first president to enter and go to that church.
President Donald Trump: (07:14)
Now, when I said go to the church, I didn’t know protesters or not. Nobody tells me that. They say, “Yes, sir, we’ll go to the church.” We walked over to the church. It was very fast. I think it was very symbolic. I did hold up a Bible. I think that’s a good thing, not a bad thing, and many religious leaders loved it.
President Donald Trump: (07:31)
As to… If you read Mollie Hemingway, who I know you’re a fan of and I’m a big fan of, she wrote a piece that it was all fake news. There’s so much fake news. Most news is fake. They’re corrupt, and they’re fake, the lamestream media. If you read the story and if you read what Mollie Hemingway said, who’s a real reporter, a great journalist, you’ll see that that story was fake. They didn’t use tear gas. They didn’t use… They moved them out.
President Donald Trump: (07:58)
Now, when I went, I didn’t say, “Oh, move them out.” I didn’t know who was there. I figured I was going to walk over the church very nearby. If you read the Mollie Hemingway piece, you’ll get the real story, but most religious leaders loved it. Why wouldn’t they love it? I’m standing in front of a church that went through trauma, to put it mildly. I mean, the whole basement, a big part of the basement was burning. It’s very lucky that church didn’t burn down. That’s a very important church, so I haven’t heard-
Brian Kilmeade: (08:26)
I agree with you. What was the-
President Donald Trump: (08:27)
I haven’t heard what you told me.
Brian Kilmeade: (08:28)
Mr. President, was the original intent to go inside and see the damage, and did you notice it was boarded up when you got there?
President Donald Trump: (08:35)
No, they told me it was boarded up, and I said, “That’s all right. We’ll stand by the church. We won’t go inside.” It had received a very bad burning. I would have been able to go inside if I wanted to, but it was boarded up. The whole building was just about boarded up, but I would have been able to go in, but there’s no reason for it. It was smoke, a lot of smoke and a lot of damage, actually, a lot of damage, but it was confined to one area. The fire itself was confined to one area. But Brian, the church leaders loved that I went there with a Bible. I mean, take a look at Franklin Graham, so respected, and so many others. Take a look at Robert Jeffress. These are all people you know. They thought it was a great-
Brian Kilmeade: (09:14)
I hear you.
President Donald Trump: (09:14)
… symbol, and I thought it was a great symbol, but the fake news makes everything look bad, no matter what you do. We did a great job on ventilators. We’re giving them now to countries all over the world, we’re making them. When I started, we had practically none. The cupboards were bare. The Obama administration left us practically nothing. You don’t hear those stories. They don’t write about that.
President Donald Trump: (09:34)
We tested number 16 million yesterday, much more than anybody else. You don’t hear that we’ve done well in testing. They always say, “Well, why not more?” and yet Germany is at 3 million. We’re 16 million. We have incredible testing now. We’ve done a great job, but we don’t get credit for it, but hopefully, the people understand.
Brian Kilmeade: (09:52)
You have a pandemic and a national unrest, two unprecedented things, I would argue, in my lifetime, and probably yours. But the big picture, I thought we’d be talking about the day after George Floyd’s tragic death, which I think you agree it seems that law enforcement, you don’t want to convict someone before they have trial, but 96% of the country thinks that was out of bounds. The knee on the neck killed him. I’m one of them. [inaudible 00:10:20] can’t see-
President Donald Trump: (10:21)
[crosstalk 00:10:21]-
Brian Kilmeade: (10:21)
… [inaudible 00:10:21] the trial comes out, but this is the one stat I want to bring you to. I’m going to ask you if you can attack this. According to a Axios-Ipsos poll, 70% of white Americans say they trust the local police. Only 36% of African Americans do. How do you attack that problem? How do you change things?
President Donald Trump: (10:40)
Well, I think it’s a very sad problem. As you know, as a Republican, I’m doing very well with African Americans and with the vote, in polls and everything, especially I’ve been… I haven’t seen one very recently because you had the plague come in from China, so that changed things up, but we had the best economy ever, we have the best numbers for African American on employment and unemployment in history, best home ownership, best everything. We had the best numbers in everything, not only African-American, but the African American numbers were great.
Brian Kilmeade: (11:10)
But how do you handle the law enforcement part of this?
President Donald Trump: (11:12)
Well, I think you have to-
Brian Kilmeade: (11:12)
How do you handle the law enforcement part of this?
President Donald Trump: (11:13)
… get better than what they’ve been doing. I mean, obviously, that was a terrible thing. I’ve spoken about it numerous times in various speeches. It’s interesting. I spoke about it when we launched a very successful rocket, a tremendous program that culminated on that day, and now, obviously, it goes on from there, but I then made a speech, and it was a speech about the rocket, and I devoted at 25% of the speech, probably, to what happened, or more, to what happened with respect to George, George Floyd, and it was… Then you… Listen to this. “He doesn’t talk about George Floyd.”
President Donald Trump: (11:49)
The rocket went off. I then made a speech, and I talked about George Floyd, but they said, “He didn’t talk about George Floyd.” Half, maybe even almost half of the speech, but a large portion of the speech was devoted exactly to that. With the media, basically, no matter what you do, it’s never going to be good enough, but the people understand it, and that’s one of the beauties to social media. I mean, I would love-
Brian Kilmeade: (12:13)
So-
President Donald Trump: (12:13)
… not to even bother with social media, but I’m able to get my word out beautifully by social media. Fortunately, you use social media too.
Brian Kilmeade: (12:26)
Right.
President Donald Trump: (12:26)
But we have to get-
Brian Kilmeade: (12:27)
Also-
President Donald Trump: (12:27)
… the word out.
Brian Kilmeade: (12:27)
[crosstalk 00:12:27]-
President Donald Trump: (12:27)
Look, we have to… Brian, we have get the police departments, everybody has to do better, has to do better. This is a longterm problem. This didn’t happen today. This happened, I mean… A guy like Sleepy Joe Biden was in there for 43 years. Then he says, “I think we should do this.” I saw today he took his mask off for the first time in a while. I haven’t seen his face for a long time. He said, “I think we should do this,” or, “I think we should do that,” and actually, then he started speaking through the mask again. He feels comfortable with a mask on, I think, even though there was nobody anywhere near him, which is interesting, but-
Brian Kilmeade: (12:59)
Well-
President Donald Trump: (12:59)
… he made a statement about what he should do. I said, “He’s been there for 43 years. He was vice president for eight years. He didn’t do a thing.” His crime bill was a-
Brian Kilmeade: (13:06)
I’ll tell you what-
President Donald Trump: (13:06)
… disaster.
Brian Kilmeade: (13:08)
Right. I will tell you what he said. He said he won’t traffic in fear and division. He won’t fan the flames. He’ll seek to heal the racial wounds that have long played our country, not use them for political gain. I assume that he says, “You are doing all those things.”
President Donald Trump: (13:28)
Well, you see, he was written… That speech was there. He didn’t say that. He repeated the words. That’s all. That speech was written for him because he doesn’t speak like that. But here’s the thing. He did a crime bill that was a disaster. What he did with Clarence Thomas was a disaster. It was a disaster, the way he treated Clarence Thomas, a black man, a great justice as it turns out, but go back to those horrible days the way he treated Clarence Thomas. They write books about it. There was nobody worse than Biden.
President Donald Trump: (13:54)
Now, he’s not the same Biden. He’s about half, maybe less, but the fact is that he doesn’t say that. They write. He’s surrounded by… The Democrats have bad policy, in many ways, they’re bad politicians because their policy, open borders, take away everybody’s guns. They want to take your guns away, except now more people bought guns in the last three, four days than they have it a-
Brian Kilmeade: (14:18)
[crosstalk 00:14:18]-
President Donald Trump: (14:18)
… long time because when they look-
Brian Kilmeade: (14:19)
But Mr. President-
President Donald Trump: (14:19)
… out on the streets-
Brian Kilmeade: (14:22)
Right. I know. I saw it in my own neighborhood. They were wrapped around the building buying guns all last night as protesters were actually in suburbs-
President Donald Trump: (14:28)
Well, they want-
Brian Kilmeade: (14:28)
… last night.
President Donald Trump: (14:28)
… security, and they want-
Brian Kilmeade: (14:28)
But-
President Donald Trump: (14:30)
… safety. That’s right, and the-
Brian Kilmeade: (14:32)
But Mr. President-
President Donald Trump: (14:32)
… Democrats want to take the guns away.
Brian Kilmeade: (14:34)
In three separate polls, he’s beating you by about 10 points. How do you-
President Donald Trump: (14:39)
Okay, and I have-
Brian Kilmeade: (14:39)
… explain that.
President Donald Trump: (14:39)
… other polls where I’m winning, and you’ve seen them too, I guess, but I have polls. Just like last time, I was losing to Hillary in every state, and I won every state. I won Michigan. I won Wisconsin. I won places that they didn’t even think were pollable. They didn’t even want to go bother. We have tremendous support. I’ve seen many polls. CNN, didn’t CNN just to have a poll, which they didn’t want to use, where I was winning every single swing state? I think you’ve seen that. I had-
Brian Kilmeade: (15:08)
Couple weeks back.
President Donald Trump: (15:08)
… another poll yesterday… Yeah. Two weeks back. I had another poll, and CNN didn’t want to use it, so they used another poll where mostly Democrats were polled. Take a look at who they’re polling if they poll anybody because I don’t even think they go out and poll. I think they sit at a desk and say, “Give this number, give that number.”
President Donald Trump: (15:25)
That’s what happened the last time. The polling was ridiculous, other than two or three polls, which I do use and which I’m doing very well with. But I saw another poll where I’m winning every swing state, substantially. Why wouldn’t I? I built the greatest economy we’ve ever had. I built the greatest economy in the world in a fairly short period of time, three and a half years. Then the plague came in from China. They shouldn’t have let it happen. Not right. It came in from China. In fact, I see today, there’s a big article that they weren’t very transparent or forthcoming to put it mildly, the stall, they call it-
Brian Kilmeade: (16:00)
To the WHO.
President Donald Trump: (16:02)
… but I built this great economy, and I’m building it again, Brian. By the time of election, I believe the economy will be doing phenomenal numbers, big job increases, big GDP increases, and that’ll be before the election. I also think by the end of the year, we’ll have a vaccine. We’re doing very well. I just had a meeting yesterday. I think we’re going to have therapeutics, and I think we’re going to have cures, so we’re going to be in very good shape, but, you know… Right now, by the way, the numbers came out today, and they were much better than anybody would have thought. The stock market is booming. The stock market is at 26,000, almost 26,000 right now, the Dow, and who would think that because-
Brian Kilmeade: (16:40)
It’s gone up.
President Donald Trump: (16:44)
… people know, and we’re going to have a great year next year. It’s going to be a phenomenal year. We’re going to have a very good third quarter. We’re going to have a phenomenal fourth quarter. If I’m heading in that direction, I think we’re going to be very hard to beat, frankly, because Sleepy-
Brian Kilmeade: (16:57)
Couple of things.
President Donald Trump: (16:58)
… Joe turn-
Brian Kilmeade: (16:58)
I know-
President Donald Trump: (16:58)
… off immediately.
Brian Kilmeade: (17:00)
I know you got about a hundred meetings today, and I appreciate this time.
President Donald Trump: (17:04)
I do.
Brian Kilmeade: (17:04)
So does our audience. But Mr. President, a couple of things, the word is you want to invite Vladimir Putin to the G7 meeting. Let’s say it’s in September. What has he done to earn back the trust of the free world? He hasn’t left the Ukraine. He hasn’t left Georgia, creates havoc in Venezuela. Do you see where he deserves this respect?
President Donald Trump: (17:23)
Yeah. Well, look, helped us with the oil industry, which was good for him too, but we got it up, and now we’re going to save millions of jobs in Texas and North Dakota and other places, Oklahoma, with millions of jobs. I mean the oil now is sustainable. I’ve been, it was down to zero, which would have ruined… We would’ve lost 5 million jobs, but no, it’s not a question of what’s he done. It’s a question of common sense.
President Donald Trump: (17:47)
We have a G7. He’s not there. Half of the meeting is devoted to Russia, and if he was there, it’d be much easier to solve. He used to be, it used to be the G8, and Obama got taken over to cleaners. I mean, Obama had his pockets picked, and as you know, Putin did something that he shouldn’t have done because he didn’t respect Obama perhaps, and Obama got upset, and the United States said, “We don’t want to be here. Putin’s going to be there.”
President Donald Trump: (18:11)
The problem is many of the things that we talk about are about Putin, so we’re just sitting around wasting time because then you have to finish your meeting and somebody has to call Putin or deal with Putin on different things. I say, “Have him in the room. Have him in the room.” It used to be the G8 from a… and I don’t say deserving or non-deserving. I say, common sense. Get things done. I want to have a nuclear pack, just a safe nuclear because nuclear is the single biggest problem the world has. Single biggest problem, the power, and we have-
Brian Kilmeade: (18:43)
China-
President Donald Trump: (18:44)
… them, and we have more than anybody. We have more than anybody. China’s a very big problem. We did very well with China-
Brian Kilmeade: (18:50)
So-
President Donald Trump: (18:50)
… but then they sent us the plague.
Brian Kilmeade: (18:50)
Is that deal done?
President Donald Trump: (18:50)
Excuse me?
Brian Kilmeade: (18:50)
Is that deal done? Is that deal done-
President Donald Trump: (18:50)
The trade deal is done-
Brian Kilmeade: (18:50)
… [inaudible 00:18:50].
President Donald Trump: (18:50)
… but the trade deal got finished and the ink was in dry when the virus floated over from China and started killing everybody in the world, not just here, in the whole world. You look at Brazil, look at these countries, look at what Italy went through and Spain and France and all of them. I mean, the whole world, a 186 countries. When you say is the trade deal done, yeah, the trade deal’s done. It was a great deal.
President Donald Trump: (19:20)
China was having, before the plague, China was having the worst year they’ve had in 66 years. That’s because of me, and I’m not proud of that. I’m just saying that these presidents let China pick our pockets, and I did a great trade deal, but you know what, I’m not excited about anything with respect to China right now because of what happened. They could have sealed it. They could have closed it off.
President Donald Trump: (19:44)
I ask this. Why is it Wuhan… It came out of Wuhan. Why is it that it didn’t go to China but it went to the rest of the world? It went to Europe. It went to the world. It went to the United States. Came out of it, but it didn’t go to Beijing. It didn’t go to other parts of China. What’s that all about? How come they let it go out to the world, but they didn’t let it go into China? That’s a little strange deal going on there.
Brian Kilmeade: (20:07)
Lastly, I know you’ve been taking aim at Joe Scarborough and Chris Cuomo. Why put them in your cross hairs when there’s so many other huge problems out there?
President Donald Trump: (20:17)
I just do it. People hit me. I hit back. I fight. I’ve always felt that about Scarborough. A lot of people in Florida felt he got away with murder, I think, so I’ve always felt that that’s not a uncommon story if you look at it, so we don’t have to waste time on it, but I’ve always felt that he got away with murder. That was my feeling, a very strong feeling, and I do feel it. As far as Chris Cuomo, no, I just report on his ratings. His ratings are terrible, unlike your ratings at Fox & Friends where you’re fantastically well. Thank you, Mr. President. I think I help you a lot, but you have three great people, including you. You used to be a-
Brian Kilmeade: (20:54)
[crosstalk 00:20:54].
President Donald Trump: (20:54)
… six. Then you got to be a seven or eight, and now you’re approaching the nine territory, but those other two are great.
Brian Kilmeade: (21:01)
Thanks. I just-
President Donald Trump: (21:01)
They’re great.
Brian Kilmeade: (21:02)
Always room for improvement. That’s what a good coach does. You leave-
President Donald Trump: (21:05)
That’s right.
Brian Kilmeade: (21:05)
… room for improvement.
President Donald Trump: (21:06)
That’s right. There is. That’s true.
Brian Kilmeade: (21:08)
Mr. President, it’s a critical time in America’s history. Best of luck the rest of the way, and enjoy the rest of the day and all your meetings.
President Donald Trump: (21:16)
Thank you very much, Brian. You take care. Congratulations on 10 years. That’s fantastic. Thanks a lot.

Thank you, Mr. President."
"Jun 1, 2020","THE PRESIDENT:  We had a great meeting.  All of the Republican senators were there.  I think we made tremendous progress on a lot of different issues.  Mitch and John, that was terrific.  Discussed about everything.  I think everything you can discuss.  We have a lot of very positive things happening, both in terms of the country, in terms of the election that’s coming up.  We’re doing very well in every way.","Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much. My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president is to defend our great country and the American people. I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family, justice will be served. He will not have died in vain, but we cannot allow the righteous cries and peaceful protestors to be drown out by an angry mob. The biggest victims of the rioting are peace loving citizens in our poorest communities and as their president, I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters. But in recent days, our nation has been gripped by professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals, rioters, Antifa and others.
Donald Trump: (01:24)
A number of state and local governments have failed to take necessary action to safeguard their residents. Innocent people have been savagely beaten like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in upstate New York, viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen the dreams utterly destroyed. New York’s finest have been hit in the face with bricks, brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun here in the nation’s Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II Memorial have been vandalized. One of our most historic churches was set a blaze. A federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero was shot and killed. These are not acts of peaceful protest, these are acts of domestic terror. The destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offense to humanity and a crime against God.
Donald Trump: (02:42)
America needs creation not destruction, cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, healing not hatred, justice not chaos. This is our and we will succeed 100% we will succeed. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. I am mobilizing all available, federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law abiding Americans, including your second amendment rights. Therefore, the following measures are going into effect immediately. First, we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the national guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets, mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled.
Donald Trump: (04:09)
If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great Capitol Washington DC. What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement offices to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism assaults and the wanton destruction of property. We are putting everybody on warning our seven o’clock curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threatened innocent life and property will be arrested, detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organizers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.
Donald Trump: (05:25)
This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. One law and order and that is what it is. One law, we have one beautiful law and once that is restored and fully restored, we will help you, we will help your business and we will help your family. America is founded upon the rule of law. It is the of our prosperity, our freedom and our very way of life, but where there is no law, there is no opportunity, where there is no justice there is no Liberty, where there is no safety there is no future. We must never give in to anger or hatred if malice or violence rains, then none of us is free. I take these actions today with firm resolve and with a true and passionate love for our country by far our greatest days lie ahead. Thank you very much and now I’m going to pay my respects to a very, very special place. Thank you very much."
"May 30, 2020",1:06 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
I want to thank our great Vice President for your fearless and tireless commitment to fulfilling America’s destiny in space. Thank you very much, Mike. Great job. Great job. We’re all so grateful to Mike’s wonderful wife, Karen, for being here and for all she does for our country. Thank you. Thank you, Karen. Before going further on this exciting day for all America in space, I want to say a few words about the situation in Minnesota. The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy. It should never have happened. It has filled Americans all over the country with horror, anger and grief. Yesterday, I spoke to George’s family and expressed the sorrow of our entire nation for their loss. I stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace and I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace. Healing, not hatred, justice, not chaos, are the mission at hand.
Donald Trump: (01:41)
The police officers involved in this incident have been fired from their jobs. One officer has already been arrested and charged with murder. State and federal authorities are carrying out an investigation to see what further charges may be warranted, including against sadly, the other three. In addition, my administration has opened a civil rights investigation and I have asked the Attorney General and the Justice Department to expedite it. I understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protestors and we hear their pleas, but what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace. The memory of George Floyd is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical left wing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down buildings.
Donald Trump: (02:59)
The main victims of this horrible, horrible situations are the citizens who live in these once lovely communities. The mobs are devastating the life’s work of good people and destroying their dream. Right now, America needs creation, not destruction, cooperation, not contempt, security, not anarchy and there will be no anarchy. Civilization must be cherished, defended, and protected. The voices of law abiding citizens must be heard and heard very loudly. We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities. We must defend the rights of every citizen to live without violence, prejudice, or fear. We support the overwhelming majority of police officers who are incredible in every way and devoted public servants. They keep our city safe, protect our communities from gangs and drugs and risk their own lives for us every day.
Donald Trump: (04:22)
No one is more upset than fellow law enforcement offices by this small handful who failed to abide by their oath to serve and protect. My administration will stop mob violence and we’ll stop it cold. It does not serve the interest of justice or any citizen of any race, color, or creed for the government to give into anarchy, abandoned police precincts, or allow communities to be burned to the ground, won’t happen. Those making excuses or justifications for violence are not helping the downtrodden, but delivering new anguish and new pain. From day one of my administration, we’ve made it a top priority to build up distressed communities and revitalize our crumbling inner cities. We fought hard with Senator Tim Scott ___ and many others to create opportunity zones, helping to draw a surge of new investment to the places in our country that need it most.
Donald Trump: (05:45)
We must all work together as a society to expand opportunity and to create a future of greater dignity and promise for all of our people. We must forge a partnership with community leaders, local law enforcement and the faith community to restore hope. Radical left criminals, thugs, and others all throughout our country and throughout the world, will not be allowed to set communities ablaze. We won’t let it happen. It harms those who have the least, and we will be protecting those who have the least. The leadership of the National Guard and the Department of Justice are now in close communication with state and city officials in Minnesota and we’re coordinating our efforts with local law enforcement all across our nation. In America, justice is never achieved at the hands of an angry mob. I will not allow angry mobs to dominate, won’t happen. It is essential that we protect the crown jewel of American democracy, the rule of law and our independent system of justice.
Donald Trump: (07:15)
Every citizen in every community has the right to be safe in their workplace, safe in their homes and safe in our city streets. This is the sacred right of all Americans that I am totally determined to defend and will defend. My administration will always stand against violence, mayhem and disorder. We will stand with the family of George Floyd, with the peaceful protestors and with every law abiding citizen who wants decency, civility, safety, and security. We are working toward a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down.
Donald Trump: (08:03)
But that means building up, not tearing down, joining hands, not hurling fests, standing in solidarity, not surrendering to hostility. Moments ago as we went and just the launch of two great American astronauts into space, we were filled with the sense of pride and unity that brings us together as Americans. That same spirit, which powered our astronauts to the moon has also helped lift our country to ever greater heights of justice and opportunity throughout our history. So today, as we mark a renewed commitment to America’s future in space, a tremendous commitment it is. Let us also commit to a brighter future for all of our citizens right here on earth. When Americans are united, there is nothing we cannot do. From day one of my administration, we put America first.
Donald Trump: (09:17)
This afternoon, I am delighted to be with you at Cape Canaveral in this storied home of American daring aspiration and drive. This is the first big space message in 50 years, think of that, and it is an honor to be delivering it. Today as we gather in this special place to celebrate not only the launch of a new spacecraft, but also our Nation’s bold and triumphant return to the stars, it’s a special day. Moments ago, the world bore witness to the flight of the first new manned U.S. spacecraft in nearly 40 years since the space shuttle launched in 1981, a long time ago. I am thrilled to announce that the SpaceX Dragon capsule has successfully reached low earth orbit and that our astronauts are safe and sound. With this launch, the decades of last years and little action are officially over. A new age of American ambition has now begun. Past leaders put the United States at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore. Today, we once again, proudly launch American astronauts on American rockets, the best in the world from right here on American soil.
Donald Trump: (11:11)
Those of us who saw the spectacular and unforgettable liftoff this afternoon watched more than an act of history. We watched an act of heroism. Every time our astronauts climb aboard a rocket, which is many, many stories of only engine and fuel and vault across the sky, they display breathtaking valor. What Colonel Douglas Hurley and Colonel Robert Behnken did this afternoon was pure American genius and courage. They joined the ranks of just seven prior American astronauts who have made the perilous maiden voyage to test a new class of spacecraft. The names of Hurley and Behnken will stand in the history books alongside those of legends like Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, John Young. Now these brave and selfless astronauts will continue their mission to advance the cause of human knowledge as they proceed to the International Space Station before returning to Earth. We wish them Godspeed on their journey and as one proud nation, we salute their fearless service. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (12:42)
I also want to send our Nation’s gratitude to the wives of these valiant astronauts, both of whom are astronauts themselves, Karen Nyberg and Megan McArthur. We join them in praying for our heroes safe return. As you know, this spring, our nation has endured the pain and hardship of a global pandemic. As we usher in a new era of manned spacecraft, we are reminded that America is always in the process of transcending great challenges. Our Nation is blessed with limitless reserves of talent, tenacity, and resolve. The same spirit of American determination that sends our people into space, will conquer this disease on Earth. It should have never happened. Nothing, not even gravity itself can hold Americans down or keep America back. We are grateful to NASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine and Director of Kennedy Space Center, Bob Cabana, for welcoming us this evening. Very special. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Great job. Great job.
Donald Trump: (14:13)
Come a long way in three and a half years, Jim haven’t we? A long way. To the incredible men and women of NASA from here at Kennedy Space Center to the Johnson Space Center in Texas, we love you too, to NASA Plum Brook Station in Sandusky, Ohio, thank you all for working so hard to make this day a reality. We have many other great days almost ready to happen. Also with us are many members of my cabinet, including our great new DNI, John Radcliffe. Thank you, John. Thank you. We have a great friend of mine, special man ran a great, great campaign, Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis. Thank you, Ron. Thank you, Ron. Your senators, Rick Scott and Marco Rubio. Thank you very much. Thank you. Leader Kevin McCarthy, Kevin, thank you very much. Great job you do Kevin. And representatives, Matt Gaetz, John Rutherford, Michael Waltz, Bill Posey, Gus Bilirakis, Daniel Webster, Brian Mast, Elise Stefanik, Bill Flores, Brian Babin, Rodney Davis, Roger Marshall and Steven Palazzo. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (15:51)
What a great group of people. They’re warriors, they’re really warriors. They helped so much get this done and so many other things. With us also-
Donald Trump: (16:01)
With us also, is our Air Force Chief Of Staff General David Goldfein. General, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, General. Thank you. And Chief of Space Operation, the first ever named, and now a member of the joint chiefs of staff, because we created the United States Space Force. General Jay Raymond. Thank you very much, Jay. Thank you, Jay.
Donald Trump: (16:40)
And senior members also of our great United States military, has never been stronger than it is right now. Also Attorney General of Florida, Ashley Moody, and Chief Financial Officer of Florida, Jimmy Patronis and many other distinguished guests. Thank you very much for being here, we appreciate it. I especially want to congratulate someone who truly embodies the American ethos, a big thinking and risk taking. After achieving success as an internet entrepreneur, he could’ve spent his fortune doing anything, including yachting, lots of things, he could do lots of things. But in 2002, he began pouring tens of millions of dollars of his own money into research and development for a new rocket. He’s a little different than a lot of other people. He liked rockets. He assembled a crew of some of the greatest minds and talent in American aerospace. In the years since SpaceX has become the first private company to develop and successfully launch its own rocket into orbit. The first to launch and recover its own capsule. And of course, moments ago, SpaceX became the first private company to put humans into orbit around the earth. Elon Musk, congratulations. Congratulations, Elon. Thanks Elon. For Elon and 8,000 SpaceX employees, today is the fulfillment of a dream almost two decades in the making. For years on end, they have worked hand in hand with NASA, sculpting aluminum, tightening valves, tuning nozzles, testing parachutes, and filling massive tanks with thousands and thousands of pounds of kerosene and liquid oxygen. Today, the groundbreaking partnership between NASA and SpaceX has given our nation the gift of an unmatched power, a state of the art spaceship to put our astronauts into orbit at a fraction of the cost of the Space Shuttle and it’s much better. From now on the United States will leverage the fast growing capabilities of our commercial sector and the finest pieces of real estate on Earth, which you need very badly, to send U.S. astronauts into space. Under NASA’s commercial crew program, we will use rockets and spacecraft designed, built, owned, and launched by private American companies at a fixed price for the American taxpayer. Today’s launch makes clear the commercial space industry is the future. The modern world was built by risk takers and renegade fierce competitors, skilled craftsmens, captains of industry who pursued opportunities no one else saw and envisioned what no one else could ever think of seeing. The United States will harness the unrivaled creativity and speed of our private sector to stride even further into the unknown. This launch also marks an exciting turning point for NASA. This agency will now focus its unmatched expertise like nobody’s ever seen and power and integrity to do what NASA does better than anyone else and it’s not even close. Embark on the most difficult, most daring, most audacious missions in the history of humankind. When I first came into office three and a half years ago, NASA had lost its way and the excitement, energy and ambition as almost everybody in this room knows, was gone. There was grass growing through the cracks of your concrete runways, not a pretty sight, not a pretty sight at all.
Donald Trump: (21:26)
The last administration presided over the closing of the Space Shuttle and almost all of the giant facility that keeps so many people working, so many brilliant minds going. People were crying, they were devastated, but now it’s the greatest of its kind anywhere in the world and we’ll get greater and greater with years to come. I promise you that. We have created the envy of the world and will soon be landing on Mars. And we’ll soon have the greatest weapons ever imagined in history. I’ve already seen designs and even I can’t believe it. The United States has regained our place of prestige as the world leader. As has often been stated, you can’t be number one on Earth, if you are number two in space. And we are not going to be number two anywhere. Nowhere is this more true than with our military, which we have completely rebuilt. Under my administration, we have invested two and a half trillion dollars in new planes, ships, submarines, tanks, missiles, rockets, anything you can think of. And last year I signed the law, creating the sixth branch of that already very famous United States Armed Forces, the Space Force.
Donald Trump: (23:22)
For every citizen who has eagerly waited for America to reignite those engines of will, confidence and imagination that put a man on the moon, I stand before you to say you need wait no longer. Through NASA’s Artemis program, the United States is preparing for a crude mission to Mars. Earlier this week, I saw the Orion capsules being worked on in this building as part of the Artemis Moon to Mars program. Those capsules will soon return Americans-
Donald Trump: (24:03)
Those capsules will soon return Americans to lunar orbit for the first time in over 50 years, half a century. By 2024, our astronauts will return to the lunar surface to establish a permanent presence and the launching pad to Mars. And the first woman on the moon will be an American woman, and the first nation to land on Mars will be the United States of America.
Donald Trump: (24:44)
Since I signed the order to establish these goals shortly after taking office, we have made rapid gains. A new 22,000 pound capsule is already built. The next generation of spacesuits are already made. Colossal rockets are now being tested, and the contracts for three separate lunar landers have been awarded and signed, and they are magnificent. In the years ahead, America will go bigger, bolder, further, faster, and America will go first. America will always be first. To be certain, we will meet the adversity and hardship along the way. There may even be tragedy because that is the danger of space. There’s nothing we can do about that. The power that we’re talking about is unrivaled. It’s nothing we can do about problems, but we’ll have very few of them. We will confront all of those challenges, knowing that the quest for understanding is the oldest and deepest hope in our souls.
Donald Trump: (26:15)
The innate human desire to explore and innovate is what propels the engines of progress and the march of civilization. We will preserve and persevere, and we will ensure a future of American dominance in space. To that end, over the last three years, I reestablished the National Space Council. I issued a directive cutting red tape for innovative space companies, such as SpaceX. We created the world’s first comprehensive space traffic management system. Last month, I signed an executive order establishing U.S. policy for the recovery and use of space resources and minerals. Administrator Bridenstine announced the Artemis Accords to govern the future of space exploration development. Together, we will assert America’s rightful heritage as the greatest spacefaring nation on the planet. And already it’s not even close. In the half a century since the United States stopped sending astronauts to deep into space, 1972, no other country has ever done it.
Donald Trump: (27:43)
The reasons are simple: cost, technological complexity, and tremendous danger. For instance, I was told that the rocket you just witnessed had to be launched within one second, or it would be impossible for it to hit its target. And I was here two days ago, and I said to Jim, “Jim, it’s okay, why don’t you wait five or 10 minutes?” And he said, “Sir, we only have a window of one second.” And I walked out of here, shaking my head. “Is that true, Jim?” “Yes, it’s true.” Space travel is not a feat of engineering alone. It’s also a moral endeavor, a measure of a nation’s vision, its willpower, its place in the world.
Donald Trump: (28:42)
Exploration is a test of our values and of our faith. America is a nation defined by its commitment to discovery, to solve mysteries, to chart the unknown, to press the limits, to achieve the fullest expression of life’s potential and to ensure that America is the nation that always leads the way and especially in space. This evening, I am more confident than ever before that America stands poised to thrive in this grand undertaking. It’s incredible. We are a nation of pioneers. We are the people who crossed the ocean, carved out a foothold on a vast continent, settled a great wilderness, and then set our eyes upon the stars. This is our history and this is our destiny.
Donald Trump: (29:42)
Now, like our ancestors before us, we are venturing out to explore a new magnificent frontier. It’s called space. Our most daring feats, our most epic journeys, our biggest adventures, and our finest days are just beginning. America’s proudest moments are still ahead. We are on the verge of our most exciting years, and next year may be the most exciting of all, you just watch. So today as our brave American astronauts shake the earth and blaze a trail of fire and steel into the heavens, we proclaim for all to hear that we have not yet tested the full strength of the American character, and the world has not yet seen the full glory of the American spirit. For our country, for our children, and for humanity’s march into the stars, the best is yet to come.
Donald Trump: (30:53)
It was a great honor for me to deliver this speech. God bless our brave astronauts now soaring through the heavens. God bless the men and women of NASA and God bless America. Thank you very much."
"May 29, 2020",12:40 P.M. EDT,"President Donald Trump: (00:00)
Appreciate it. I want to express our nation’s deepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathies to the family of George Floyd. Terrible event. Terrible, terrible thing that happened. I’ve asked that the Department of Justice expedite the federal investigation into his death and do it immediately. Do it as quickly as absolutely possible. It’s a local situation, but we’re also making it into a federal situation. And it’s a terrible thing. We all saw what we saw and it’s very hard to even conceive of anything other than what we did see. It should never happen, should never be allowed to happen, a thing like that, but we’re determined that justice be served. And I spoke to members of the family, terrific people, and we’ll be reporting as time goes by. We think that we also have to make the statement and it’s very important that we have peaceful protestors and support the rights for peaceful protesters. We can’t allow a situation like happened in Minneapolis to descend further into lawless anarchy and chaos, and we understand that very well. It’s very important, I believe, to the family, to everybody that the memory of George Floyd be a perfect memory. Let it be a perfect memory. The looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters. They hurt so badly what is happening and it’s so bad for the state and for that great city. So we are working very closely with the Justice Department. We’re working with local law enforcement. We’re working with everybody and we’re speaking with the family and hopefully everything can be fairly taken care of.
President Donald Trump: (02:11)
I understand the hurt. I understand the pain. People have really been through a lot. The family of George is entitled to justice and the people of Minnesota are entitled to live in safety. Law and order will prevail. The Americans will honor the memory of George and the Floyd family. It’s very important to us. It’s very important to me to see that everything is taken care of properly. It’s a horrible, horrible situation. And so we’ll be reporting back in due course and as quickly as possible.
President Donald Trump: (02:54)
I’m pleased to welcome American industry leaders to the White House as we continue to safely reopened America. We’re glad to be joined by Geoff Ballotti of Wyndham Hotel and Resorts. Wyndham Hotels have been a really terrific company over the years. Brian Goldner of Hasbro, Dave Hoffmann of Dunkin brands, Gary Kelly of Southwest Airlines. Really good jobs they’ve done. Rodney McMullen of Kroger. Thanks, Rodney. Oscar Munoz, United. Thank you, Oscar, United Airlines. Brad Smith of Microsoft. That stock has done very well, I will say. Great job. Great job. Sonia Syngal of Gap, and thank you very much. Also with us is Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin and Secretary of Labor, Gene Scalia.
President Donald Trump: (03:51)
Our nation continues to mourn for the lives claimed by the virus and grieve for the families who have lost loved ones. We continue to battle the invisible enemy. We’re directing the full resources and support of the federal government to safeguard high-risk populations, especially in nursing homes. We put in a very powerful strategy on nursing homes for quite a while. The best strategy for public health is to aggressively protect the most vulnerable while allowing younger and healthier Americans to work safely. Nationwide hospitalizations, new cases and deaths are all declining. We’re tracking cases and hospitalizations daily in states that are demonstrating their ability to rapidly identify and contain new outbreaks. Our testing is the best in the world. We’ve now surpassed 15 million tests, which is much more than any other country by a factor of many times. We’ve completed over 15 million and I think we can say that’s a record by a lot. And we’re going to give you a big report on testing tomorrow. We have new tests coming out that are above and beyond anything that anybody would have thought even possible just a couple of months ago.
President Donald Trump: (05:16)
In many places, we’ve had more tests available than people seeking them. Florida and others have said that they have testing and they don’t have enough people to take the tests. So we’ve come a long way. We started with an empty cupboard. We didn’t have a lot that we inherited and we are… I think, really they’ve stepped up to the plate on ventilators, on tests and on equipment and gowns and everything else, gloves. If you look at masks, everybody has masks now. To maintain the health and safety of our society, we must also maintain the health our economy. There’s a reason why our nation’s life expectancy is closely correlated with economic development. A never ending shutdown would increase, not reduce, the total loss of life in the United States while failing to focus resources on the most vulnerable. We’ve made a lot of progress in terms of the invisible enemy. A lot of progress, a lot of things have happened that have taught us a lot. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this, and there certainly hasn’t been anything like this since over a hundred years, 1917.
President Donald Trump: (06:32)
I want to thank all of these great companies for being here and representing their company and themselves and our country so well. We’re going to be having a discussion with the companies as to suggestions they have. We think we’re going to have a very strong opening, which has just started, really. We had the greatest economy in history of any country, not just ours. The greatest in history. We had the best employment numbers that we’ve ever had. We’ve had the best numbers in every way. Whether it’s the biggest tax cuts, the greatest regulation cuts of any president, nobody’s even come close. We’ve rebuilt our military. We have the strongest military we’ve ever had. New equipment coming in all the time, a lot of it already arrived and very importantly, all made in the USA. And so many other things.
President Donald Trump: (07:23)
You look at what we’ve done for the vets with choice and accountability, the combination. They weren’t able to get that done for over 40 years and we got them both approved. Right to Try, got it approved. We’ve done so much and then we had to turn it all off in order to be in a position where we are right now. Numbers were estimated to be 2 million deaths, one and a half million deaths, maybe 1 million, but it could have been over 2 million and may be substantially over. Unfortunately, one is too many.
President Donald Trump: (07:57)
It should have been stopped. It could have been stopped in China. It should have been stopped in China. But it didn’t stop and the world got infected and it’s very sad. It’s a very sad thing. But we turned off the greatest economy ever, and we turned it off very quickly, very rapidly. We banned people coming in from China early, very early. In fact, most people said, don’t do it. Even a month later they were saying, you shouldn’t have done it. And we turned out to be right. But we have now a long way to go. But we’re getting very good early numbers, as everyone knows. The stock market has been doing very well because people have a lot of confidence.
President Donald Trump: (08:38)
We’re doing very well on therapeutics. We’re doing very well on vaccines. I think we’re going to have some very good answers soon. And we’re set up logistically with our military. Our military is set to move and to act so that when, I think I can say when we have that vaccine. I think I can say it with pretty good surety based on what we’re seeing. That rather than taking long periods of time and bringing it out slowly, we’re able to bring it out very, very quickly. So we have a general in charge of logistics, that’s what he does and he’s supposed to be the best. Usually moving soldiers and moving various things for other reasons, but now he’s going to be moving vaccines or therapeutics depending on what ultimately ends up. But we’re doing very well on vaccines. We’re doing very, very well on therapeutics and maybe I could use the word cure as opposed to purely therapeutic.
President Donald Trump: (09:32)
So I want to thank everybody for being here. We have a lot of positive things to report. You see some of the numbers coming out with some of the states that have been opened and some of the numbers have been really, really beyond expectations. So we’re very happy. And I think what we’ll do is we’ll go around the room quickly and we’ll say a few things about any ideas you might have, your company, how well you’ve done with your companies and might as well give it a little buildup. You have plenty of firepower back here. So please, [inaudible 00:10:03] you start. Thank you.
Sonia Syngal: (10:04)
Great. Thank you, Mr. President. I’m honored to be here today as representing Gap Inc and working with all of you to safely open our stores, which is very important for us right now. I have the honor of running America’s largest clothing company. Gap Inc had over 16 billion in revenue last year, and we house 4 billion dollar brands between Old Navy, Athleta, Banana Republic and our namesake, Gap. And Old Navy is the second largest apparel brand in the US. So we have serviced American families for our 51 years and these brands represent the best of American values and we’re anxious to get going and anxious to open up the economy.
Sonia Syngal: (10:50)
We have 2,500 stores here in the US and we’ve begun the opening process. Prior to COVID, we had over a million American customers walking through our doors every day. And so when we shut in March, we lost 70% of our sales overnight, and we reacted very quickly. We had to make really big unfortunate decisions to furlough employees and to retrench. We did have a very strong and powerful e-commerce business. So we’re the second largest e-com player for apparel and that’s really kept us going along with our fulfillment centers. We have five big campuses across the US and so that’s been great. We have over a hundred thousand employees that we’re anxious to bring back to work.
Sonia Syngal: (11:38)
We’ve developed these safe shopping protocols with industry leaders in retail, and we feel really good about them. We’re anxious to reopen our stores with these protocols and have been excited about what’s happening so far as we’ve opened. Our employees feel safe, our customers feel safe and they’re coming back to shop with us. And so we are committed to opening at least 800 stores this month. And so we’re on track for that. In fact, we’re a little ahead of that, which feels good. And as customers come in, they’ll have new protocols, social distancing, masks, and cleaning, et cetera. So it’s going to create trust and everyone’s responding really well.
Sonia Syngal: (12:16)
I visited our stores in Virginia last night, and I visited our stores in Texas and Arizona, California over the last couple of weeks and our customers are thrilled to be back. Our employees are thrilled to be back. In fact, one of our store managers came up to me and burst into tears thanking me for giving her her job back. It’s a really very important thing. And as much as the government’s helped, our employees want to be back. So that feels great.
Sonia Syngal: (12:44)
One in four Americans work in retail, as you know. So this is now my time to ask what we need. And during this closure process, half of retail stayed open, and half of retail’s been shut. So we’ve really created this lack of level playing field, the haves and the have nots. And as we look forward and as we think about a possibility of a resurgence or something, we must stay committed to these safe retailing protocols and really stay there and work through any future issues with that so we can have an equal playing field. So I look forward to working with you. And Secretary Mnuchin has been fantastic work with.
President Donald Trump: (13:22)
Thank you, Sonia. That’s great. He’s done a great job. Thank you, Sonia. I appreciate it. Steve.
Steve Mnuchin: (13:25)
Thank you, Mr. President. I really want to thank everybody. And Sonia, thank you for all the work you’ve done and everyone else. I do want to just particularly thank Gary and Oscar. As part of the CARES Act, we’ve worked with both of you and the rest of the airline industry. I know many of the businesses here have been hit very hard, but the travel industry in particular, and we appreciate everything you’ve done with us. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (13:46)
Thank you very much. Oscar, please.
Oscar Munoz: (13:48)
That’s a heck of a lead in. Thank you as well. Thank you. The CARES Act was great, and everybody that was involved. Larry, you were terrific as well in the waning moments. You know our story so I won’t belabor it. I have two slides, really one, just to give you a sense of the things-
Oscar: (14:03)
I have two slides, really one, just to give you a sense of the things that we’re doing. One of the most converse discussions going, are airplanes safe? Is flying safe? And I think that’s of paramount importance. We’ve always been one of the, if not the safest industry in the world. So some of the things that we’re doing are on this chart, and it’s simply everything you think, hydrostatic testing that disinfects, wiping everything down, the wearing of masks for everyone. We were one of the first to be able to do that, touchless aspects. Our customers get a chance to choose where they sit. The HEPA filters on our aircraft, I think it’s important for the flying public to understand, these HEPA filters are hospital grade filters that remove 99.7% of particles in the air. The combination of the filter and the masks that we’re wearing should completely eliminate to a great degree the aspect that if we practice all the other things. So we’re working through all of that. But again, it feels like we’re always talking into the wind with regards to that, so we took it a step further and have partnered with different people, Clorox in particular.
Oscar: (15:03)
It’s a brand name that speaks of powerful disinfectant, and that branding aspect gives it a little bit of sense. Then we went a step further and used Cleveland Clinic to guide us and direct us. Here are the things that we’re planning on doing, is that meaningful? It’s like having Ambassador Birx at our side to support those things. So those are the things that we’re doing with regards to our safety.
Oscar: (15:25)
On the next chart, your question is, how do we restart the economy? If I can get the next chart, please. The first one’s obvious, and I think we’ve all been talking at it in the business community. It isn’t just about airlines flying. People have to go someplace and fly somewhere, right? The hotels of the world, the restaurants, the theme parks, all of that has to be collectively. And I think everything we do as a business and as a government is to ensure that we take everybody into account and not forget the fact that airlines are only part of it. So, that’s an important part.
Oscar: (15:59)
Then again, from a health perspective, I don’t know that there’s another nation that has more powerful pull back to branding than the US. Anything that comes out of the US is going to be accepted. So, thank you for the efforts. Ambassador, it was a wonderful, those conversations.
Oscar: (16:12)
Then lastly, this is the big ask from our perspective, we are global, we fly over 60 countries. This isn’t a China question. This is the general aspect of when the world restarts to fly. It’s historically every government, every country will have its own regulatory scheme to start flying. That is called patchwork. That is not harmonization. In order to get the economy going and flowing out from a perspective of the entire planet, it’s important that we work with your teams to get that harmonization and avoid patchwork, so thank you again for everything.
President Donald Trump: (16:44)
Thank you again, Oscar. Appreciate it. You’ve been very much a factor in what we’ve done. You’ve been really helpful. We appreciate it. Larry Kudlow, please.
Larry Kudlow: (16:51)
Thank you, sir. Thanks to everybody who’s come here and worked with us, and I hope everything continues apace. We try to follow, Kevin Hassett and I try to follow these high frequency economic indicators, and my little list is growing. I’ll just rattle it off, because things as things open safely, I say that because Deb is here, truckloads, freight shipping, air travel, hotel, bookings, TSA travelers, all starting to shoot up. They’re really green shoots.
Larry Kudlow: (17:28)
You mentioned the stock market, sir, which has done very well. Apple mobility, gasoline demand, tremendous housing demand, applications for mortgages and so forth, they’re actually now pre pandemic levels again with low interest rates. We had number today from the income report. The saving rate, sir, is 33% for the month of April, 33%. Which is to say, we’ve given them a lot of income, government income has boosted things, liquidity, cash, and so forth. Steven’s great efforts on Capitol Hill. And of course the stores have been closed. They have nowhere to spend, so they’re saving at a 33% rate. That’s almost 10 times the norm. So that, my final point, as we open and as the stores open, we are going to see a boom in spending at the store. A boom.
President Donald Trump: (18:30)
I think so, I agree. We’re starting to see it. I think people are going to be very surprised. We’re going to have a great third quarter, a great fourth quarter. I think next year is going to be one of our better years. So, that’s really great. Thank you very much, Larry.
Larry Kudlow: (18:38)
Yes, sir.
President Donald Trump: (18:38)
So Jay Clayton is the head of the SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, and he’s done a fantastic job and I thought maybe I’d invite him up. And you could say a few words if you’d like, Jay.
Jay Clayton: (18:51)
Thank you, Mr. President. What I want to say is I appreciate the information that your companies have given us today. Investors want to understand the operational and financial challenges you’re facing. The more they understand them, whether they’re good or bad, the more they’ll plan [inaudible 00:19:07] for overcoming them, the more confidence they have. Our markets work better. I’d be remiss if I didn’t thank Secretary Mnuchin and our friends at the FED for the way they supported our markets through this uncertain time. And I really want to thank the many companies who’ve been very candid with their disclosure about where they stand. That’s what our investors expect. I think you’ve done a terrific job giving our investors what they expect. I look forward to continuing to work with you.
President Donald Trump: (19:35)
Thank you very much, Jay. Thank you. Southwest airlines. What a great company. Go ahead.
Gary Kelly: (19:39)
Well, thanks, Mr. President. It’s a pleasure to be here on behalf of all the Southwest people. My name is Gary Kelly, and again, I want to thank you. I want to thank Secretary Mnuchin. The Cares Act was exactly what we needed. The speed and the scope were just absolutely breathtaking. Before the markets were closed, and after that, the markets opened up, and we’ve been able to do a significant amount of financing. So thank you. It was just the right thing for our economy.
Gary Kelly: (20:10)
I’ll just mirror, echo what several have already said in terms of the business. We got down to about 2% of the normal traffic volumes, and are up well beyond that, thank goodness. We’re not there, but I’ll take 15% as opposed to a 2%. So we’ve got a long way to go, but the trends are in the right direction.
Gary Kelly: (20:36)
I think what is important is to make sure that our employees and our customers know that it is safe, and that is our number one priority to make sure that we have a healthy and safe environment. Again, I’ll echo a lot of what Oscar has already covered, but we published the Southwest promise in early May and it addresses cleaning of the airport, deep cleaning of the airplane. We require a mask of our customer facing employees, as well as our customers. We are not booking the airplanes full so that the middle seats are open to allow for physical distancing. And it’s a layered approach. The one thing that we would like to see, and I know that the administration is looking very carefully at this, is to add a health screening at the TSA checkpoint. I think a temperature check like we had today coming into the White House would be very sensible, along with a health declaration. We’re working closely with the TSA on that point.
Gary Kelly: (21:42)
I think beyond that, I think ongoing tax burden reduction would be very helpful in terms of ticket taxes. I know we’ve got a ticket tax holiday for 2020 as sales begin to pick up and airlines begin to get back on their feet. That could be something worth looking at. And I think for all of us, some sensible form of liability protection, which I know is also a topic would make great sense, but we applaud all that the administration is doing. I think the key indeed is to get treatments for when people are sick, number one, so that they’re confident that they’ll quickly get back on their feet. Then, number two, ultimately getting a vaccine. When that happens I think that things will absolutely take off.
Gary Kelly: (22:36)
Lastly, again, I wanted to thank you all for the support with the payroll support program. We’ve never had a furlough or a layoff or a pay cut in our history at Southwest, and we sure don’t want to have that now. So thank you again, and we’re going to fight the good fight here.
President Donald Trump: (22:53)
And thank you, Gary. Great job you do for a long time. Thank you very much. Deborah, please.
Deborah Birx: (23:00)
Thank you, Mr. President. We’ve made amazing progress together with the American people and with you all. As you heard the President describe, new hospitalizations are down month over month by 50%. Mortality, the fatalities that we all grieve are down significantly week over week. We’re excitingly really finding governors and mayors being able to respond to the epidemic in a new way, proactive testing, finding new cases, contact tracing, and stopping outbreaks. We’re seeing that over and over again, County by County, Metro by Metro.
Deborah Birx: (23:33)
I think we’re working with all of the healthcare providers, because just as we want to open up America safely, we want us to make sure every American has access to healthcare. We want to see our babies immunized. We want to see them at their well baby checkups. We want to see pregnant women cared for in their appointments, and we want to see the hospitals back caring for people, doing elective surgery, and ensuring people are getting their cancer screenings. So as we open up the economy, we also want to ensure the Americans are not only COVID free, but have all their healthcare taken care of.
President Donald Trump: (24:04)
So you’re seeing much improved numbers.
Deborah Birx: (24:07)
Much improved numbers. And I think this proactive testing, having enough tests available, not only for diagnosing at the hospitals and clinic, but having an abundance of testing available to really be able to do what we talk about as proactive surveillance, going into nursing homes and testing 100% of the residents, 100% of the workers, working in food processing plants to test everyone that is there and really stopping outbreaks before they start.
Deborah Birx: (24:31)
This asymptomatic piece is unique among diseases. We have that in HIV. We have it in this particular respiratory disease, so you have to test proactively to find the asymptomatic. No one intends to infect others. They just don’t know they’re infected themselves. So working with States and governors and mayors to really set up those testing sites has really been extraordinary, and having a testing available at that level, I think we’re about 350,000, 400,000 tests a day. We’re up to having tested 5% of every American in less than two months.
President Donald Trump: (25:08)
That’s fantastic. It’s great. I wish the press would report it, but someday they will. Someday they’re going to do that. Thank you very much, Deborah. I appreciate it. A lot of progress has been made. Great job you’re doing. Thank you. Please.
Brian Goldner: (25:20)
Hi, Mr. President, I’m Brian Goldner with Hasbro, and thank you for your leadership and for working closely with the private sector to reopen the American economy. You may know that Hasbro is a nearly 100 year old Rhode Island based play and entertainment company with brands like Monopoly, Transformers, Play-Doh, Peppa pig, and Nerf. It’s really an honor to be here today. It’s also an incredible honor to see how our brands are resonating with consumers, more people getting together and connecting and with games and brands like Play-Doh as they spend time together. We were talking as we were coming together today, just how people are making new connections. We’re very excited about that. Then the reopening of the economy. I also have to thank you for the partnership that we’ve had over time with director Kudlow, and it’s great to get the support that we’ve seen from Secretary Mnuchin as well.
Brian Goldner: (26:19)
From health screenings to interactive handbooks, safe return to the office, safe social distancing, staggering shifts in our warehouses and factory floors, we are safely reopening US businesses. If we could go to the next slide. We’ve worked closely with Governors in our region, the Rhode Island Governor, Raimondo, and the Massachusetts Governor, Baker, to design safe reopening guidelines. I’m especially proud of our Hasbro safety folks and operations. We’ve set a standard in our factories and warehouse operations across the country for consumer goods manufacturers. In fact, we’re training other consumer goods manufacturers to help them open safely in the US from Massachusetts to Texas.
Brian Goldner: (27:02)
So again, I’m very pleased to be here. I’m very proud of our employees. They’re all very excited about getting back to work, and we’ve been working all along. As our factories closed down during certain times over the last few months, our teams came together to make face shields in our factories, 50,000 a week-
President Donald Trump: (27:23)
That’s right.
Brian Goldner: (27:23)
To give to healthcare workers, and we’ve made good use of those factories. We’re now happy to see them back up and running. So thank you again and thank you for leadership. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (27:32)
Great job, Brian. That’s really great. We appreciate that too. Thank you very much.
David Hoffman: (27:38)
Thank you, Mr. President. Great to be here. Thank you to the team, your leadership team as well. And look, I’m here representing our great franchisees for both brands, Dunkin’ and Baskin. I don’t think a lot of people realize that we’re 100% franchised, and so big brand names powered by small independent business owners. We’ve got a saying in the company, that we think we’ve been getting …
David Hoffman: (28:03)
… in the company, that we think we’ve been getting America running for nearly 70 years, and when this crisis hit, it was about keeping the communities running, but it was also about getting America working again. And so, we’ve been guided by one simple principle, on the next slide, that we’ve been talking about is, it’s been about doing the right thing in the communities we serve, and 90% of our restaurants have remained open during the crisis. We’ve rallied around that mantra of people over profits and doing the right thing there, and look, we’re very proud that we didn’t have to furlough or do layoffs during all of that. And look, our great franchisees, I’m really proud of the work that they’ve been doing in the communities they serve. They live in these communities. They’re proud to be there. They serve probably coffee, donuts, ice cream to over 300 hospitals. They continue to do that. They raised $1.5 million for food banks, including the Capital Food Bank here in our backyard here in D.C. as well.
David Hoffman: (28:58)
And so, as somebody said, we’re starting to see a lot of hope and optimism in our business today. We’re seeing really good signs of encouraging green shoots right now. We’re working with the franchisees, again, to get America working again, looking at a really aggressive hiring campaign over the summer. But I’d say it’s three areas that we focused on that was really a good north star for us. And the first was, we got in early on a lot of the safety measures, making investments in safety measures as brand standards across both brands, but for us, and brands like Dunkin’ and Baskin, our mission is to give the consumer as many ways to access your brand on their terms.
David Hoffman: (29:41)
We know there’s a lot of consumers out there that have varying levels of comfort in terms of what’s going on right now. So whether it’s drive-thru, curbside, pick-up windows, delivery, you’ll hear a lot about digital today as well, giving the consumer as many options, as many choices to access your brand is important. And I think the last thing, I’ll repeat what a few other people said, thank you to you and your administration, the federal government, for the PPP program. That has really allowed us to keep our franchisees standing up, allowed them to continue to serve the communities and keep America working, and my ask in all of this would be, the second version of this that sailed through the house, the flexibility plan on PPP, I’m just hoping that it sales through cleanly and gets to your desk to be signed because that’s another great example of helping small, independent business owners like our franchisees keep America working right now. So, thank you for your consideration.
President Donald Trump: (30:41)
Thank you, David, very much.
David Hoffman: (30:42)
Yeah, thank you.
President Donald Trump: (30:45)
Appreciate it.
Rodney McMullen: (30:45)
Thank you, President Trump, and really appreciate the invitation to talk about reopening businesses in America. My name is Rodney McMullen. I’m the chairman and CEO of Kroger. I represent over 500,000 associates. We’ve hired over a 100,000 people over the last two months. And our job is to keep our supply chain operating fresh, affordable food and essentials, and we operate 2800 stores, 35 manufacturing plants, 44 distributions facilities. If you look at our associates, we’ve invested over $800 million in safety procedures and rewards for our associates over the last eight, nine weeks. Obviously, we all do everything we can to make sure we keep our employees safe, and on a daily basis. If you look at our customers, we have 11 million people a day that come into our stores.
Rodney McMullen: (31:44)
So, the things that we’re doing to protect our employees, we’re also doing the same thing to protect our customers. We use every available way of trying to remind customers on social distancing, limiting the number of people in the stores. We have an in-store radio network that every 15 minutes we remind people of social distancing, but everything that we can do, we’re trying to remind people to stay safe and do things. We also are supporting our business in continuing to make sure that we have a viable, strong business over time in supporting the communities that we operate in. Over the last year, working with local food banks, we’ve been able to provide, over the last three years, over a billion meals with local food banks, and it’s something that in the United States, no one should have to go to bed tonight hungry. We have so many resources as a country and together we can eliminate food waste, and when we eliminate food waste, we can make sure no one goes to bed hungry.
Rodney McMullen: (32:50)
Obviously, it’s one of the things that we thought it would be helpful to pay forward. As a company that’s operated throughout the pandemic, we’ve learned a lot, and one of the things you’ll learn is be agile and move quickly, and if you think you should do something, you probably should do it. With that, we developed a 59 page blueprint that we made public and we’ve shared it. And I know the other day I was on the Today Show and they asked me like four times, why would you do that? And one of the things that was incredibly helpful for us is, other retailers across the world that were in front of us from the pandemic standpoint, was nice enough to share their learnings with us, and we thought it was only fair and inappropriate for us to share our learnings with others.
Rodney McMullen: (33:40)
We’ve had over 100,000 site visits on that. We’ve had over 26,000 individuals and companies download that. We get a ton of notes from small companies in terms of their appreciation. If you look at all the companies in this room, we have a lot of resources, but if you think about somebody with 50 employees or a hundred employees or 200 employees, the resources they have is just not the same as us. And so, sharing that across, has been something that’s been important and it’s a real pleasure to represent all the Kroger associates in being able to help America get started again. So, thank you, Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (34:19)
Thank you, Rodney, very much, and thank you for all the help, too. You’ve been right from the beginning. Appreciate it.
Rodney McMullen: (34:24)
Yep, happy to. Thank you.
President Donald Trump: (34:25)
Thank you very much. Kevin, please.
Kevin: (34:28)
Thank you, sir. Sir, I think that you can sense the optimism around the room, that businesses, really a cross section of American businesses collected here are getting back to work, and I think this cross section is extraordinarily representative of what we’re seeing all around America. And as Larry mentioned, as you know, and as you require us, we watch every little detail of the economy every day, and there are now 27 States where more than 75% of the businesses are open. That was almost none a few weeks ago.
President Donald Trump: (35:00)
Right. That’s right.
Kevin: (35:00)
And there are 28 States where 80% of the workforce is back to work. And so, the question then becomes, and it’s the last thing I’ll say, that the people in this room are saying yes, but will we have demand for our product? And what we learned today in the personal income report that Larry said is, because you required historic policy action, we got money to people who needed it while they were laid off because of big unemployment insurance checks and because of the $1,200 checks that we mailed people, they have the income now that the economies are starting again to go out and demand product. And so, we’ve very, very bullish on what’s going on with the restart, sir.
President Donald Trump: (35:36)
Thank you very much, Kevin, appreciate it.
Geoff Ballotti: (35:39)
Mr. President, thank you on behalf of 7,000 small business owners, Wyndham Hotels and Resorts is the world’s largest franchisor, great state of New Jersey, and we have, if I could have the first slide up, remarkably remained open throughout this crisis. Much like Dave and Dunkin’, our hotels here in the United States really never closed. We were serving frontline workers. We were serving the national guard emergency workers and a large part of that had to do, if I could have the next slide, to the support that, and we really have to, the industry has to call out secretary Minutian and you’ve been there for us all along. You’ve listened to us. The PPP Act has been monumental. 95% of our franchisees have applied for either a PPP or an EID alone, and we estimate from the surveys that we’re hearing back, that 80% of them have received one of those and they view it as an absolute lifeline.
Geoff Ballotti: (36:45)
So, what Dave said is most important, this is going to be a long recovery, even though we’ve remained open. The most important thing for our franchisees is seeing this amendment to the 75/25 rule, which is in the bill, seeing the expansion of that loan term from two years to five years, I mean, that’s critical for our small business owner. In extending, as the secretary and I were talking earlier, our ability to rehire those employees that we have had to furlough, to be able to bring them back, not have it expire on June 30, but have that continue til the end of the year is critical for us.
Geoff Ballotti: (37:28)
We also think the idea of a temporary travel tax to spur leisure travel is important, and we know the administration is in favor of that, and bringing back the full deductability of necessary business expenses to spur business travel would be very, very helpful to opening our country up again, because as Oscar said, as Gary said, just as planes are safe, hotels are safe. They’re safe because we’ve been safe throughout this crisis with again, 90% of our hotels operating at low occupancy. Demand is coming back, but we need those consumers to feel safe and we just thank you for everything that you and the secretary and Congress is doing on this industry’s behalf, because it’s going to be a tough road back.
President Donald Trump: (38:21)
Well, it’s going away, but I think we’ll have vaccines, and I think we’re going to have therapeutics and maybe even beyond that, maybe a cure, and it won’t be in the long distance. So, I really think that’s going to be helpful and regardless, it’s going away, but that would certainly speed up the process so, we appreciate it, Jeff. Thank you very much. Jean?
Jean-Philippe Courtois: (38:43)
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for bringing together so many great companies, different companies, different sectors of the economy that some of them have been affected really very different ways during the pandemic. Some able to stay open, some really having great difficulty doing it, but one thing we’ve heard today and we had conversations earlier before the meeting got underway, I think all of them are very, very focused on safety. Safety of their customers, safety of their employees. I don’t think there’s been a time when American businesses have been as focused on safety as they are right now, and that’s a great thing for bringing customers back, bringing workers back. It’s been a focus of ours at the labor department, actually since January. We’ve tried to help American workers through this crisis in so many different ways, but as early as January, we were helping providing guidance guidelines to businesses.
Jean-Philippe Courtois: (39:36)
We’ve now put out guidelines to 16 different specific industries on how they can reopen safely. We’ll continue to do that so that companies understand what’s expected of them, can have confidence in what they need to do and same for workers, and we’re mindful that not every company is going to focus the right way on these things, so we’ll continue to respond to employee concerns, complaints as they come in. As Larry and Kevin said, Mr. President, we’ve turned a corner. We put out unemployment numbers yesterday showing that for the first time since February, the number of people on unemployment dropped, and that’s great. The number of filing is still much higher than we want.
President Donald Trump: (40:15)
That’s a good sign. That’s a good sign, isn’t it?
Jean-Philippe Courtois: (40:17)
We’ve turned the corner, Mr. President, and we’ll get back there to that extraordinary economy that you built so recently, and we’re going to do it safely.
President Donald Trump: (40:25)
Thank you, Jean, very much. A man who has done a very good job, Microsoft. That’s a good job they’ve done, Deborah, right? Thank you very much.
Brad Smith: (40:33)
Well, thank you, Mr. President, and I just think this is a fascinating conversation because it really shows how each industry is unique. And as an economy, we need to meet the needs of every industry and put the economy together. Not surprisingly, when you’re in a business and you’re in a sector that creates the tools that people can use to work from home, it’s not difficult to have your own employees work from home and that’s what we’ve been doing. But I think our mission in this first phase has really been much broader than that. It’s been twofold. One is, to provide the data resources and the technology to support the public health needs of the country, from public health agencies, to hospitals, to the researchers, as you mentioned, who are on the quest for a vaccine and therapeutics and the like. And I think more broadly, it is meant to work with, frankly, many of these companies around this table to sustain the economy these past few months, so that employees could work from home, so students could study from home, so that the government could operate from home when that was needed. Now, it’s all about phase two and I think you put it well. It’s all about both protecting public health and reopening the economy. And here we see in some ways, something that may look more like a dial than a switch as we go through a series of phases, we think we’ll all likely continue to see different industries with different needs. We do see technology playing some new and important role.
Brad Smith: (42:03)
We do see technology playing some new and important roles. And on this slide, which you’d have to stand within three feet of to read, you’ll see the nine different areas where we see different public health needs, but there’s three I want to call out because I think they’re especially important for the private sector. The first is the ability to use technology, to work with people, to detect the disease. I thought the reference to a health declaration was a really good one. It makes sense that the airport, many employers are going to want that on some kind of self attestation basis for their employees. It doesn’t make sense to do it on a piece of paper. We were developing an app for our employees. We realized, well, everybody’s employees need this, so we’re now partnering with United Health Group so it can be made available to everybody.
Brad Smith: (42:50)
The second layer that I think is really important for the private sector is the tracing capability. And we’re seeing both companies like Microsoft and others work to create tracing technology that can be used by individuals, that can be deployed by employers or by public health agencies. And then the last is notification, exposure notification that can be done by individuals with public health officers. I think the key to all of this is captured in the next slide. We want people to be comfortable using this technology. We need to protect people’s privacy so that they know that they’re not putting their personal information at risk when they use technology in this new way. So we’re very committed to doing that. In closing, I would say when you step back from this, this is also the right time to close the broadband gap, which you’re addressing through stimulus efforts-
President Donald Trump: (43:44)
Right, we are.
Brad Smith: (43:45)
And I think there are more. It’s the right time to invest in more skilling because we are going to see more jobs demand more digital skills than we did six months ago. And it’s the right time to maintain the focus as you have set on testing. You noted the progress, we’ve noticed the progress, we appreciate the progress. But I think even more than the progress is frankly, the high ambition level the administration has set to sustain that progress because I think by fall, if we want students to return to college campuses, if we want more employees to feel safe in the workplace, we’re going to see more private sector institutions wanting the ability to test people, even when they’re asymptomatic. And so that progress, I think will be another one of the fundamental ingredients that we’ll need. So, thank you.
President Donald Trump: (44:34)
Well, thank you very much and your first picture was so beautiful. The picture of the White House, I don’t think I’ve ever seen one more beautiful than that. I don’t know, you must have something very special over at Microsoft. Wasn’t that beautiful? We appreciate it, thank you very much, Brad. Thank you very much. You have any questions please? Any for the great executives?
Speaker 4: (44:53)
Mr. President?
President Donald Trump: (44:54)
Yeah.
Speaker 4: (44:55)
It’s obviously been a long day for a lot of Americans, but I’d like to give you an opportunity to address some of your tweets from this morning. “You tweeted when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” How would you know that phrase and not know it’s racially charged history?
President Donald Trump: (45:09)
Well, I’ve heard that phrase for a long time. I don’t know where it came from, where it originated.
Speaker 4: (45:13)
In 1967, the Miami police chief used it.
President Donald Trump: (45:17)
Well I don’t know, I’ve also heard it from many other places, but I’ve heard it for a long time as most people have. And frankly it means when there’s looting, people get shot and they die. And if you look at what happened last night and the night before, you see that. It’s very common. And that’s the way that was meant and that’s the way I think it was supposed to be meant, but I don’t know where it came from. I don’t know where it originated. I wouldn’t know a thing like that, but I will say it’s very accurate in the sense that when you do have looting, like you had last night, people often get shot and they die and that’s not good and we don’t want that to happen. Yeah, please.
Speaker 5: (45:51)
Thank you, Mr. President. In the past, you’ve criticized NFL players for their protest against police brutality. Given what we’ve seen with George Floyd and what we saw with the delays in the case of Amar Aubrey, does that change your views around those NFL protests? And also given that you had a message for those in the streets in Minneapolis, do you have a statement to make about the police that are involved in such police brutality incidents?
President Donald Trump: (46:15)
Yeah, I didn’t like what I saw at all. I thought it was a terrible thing, a terrible picture. I think that it sad in so many ways, from the standpoint of the family. When you look at George Floyd and his family and you see what that’s done to them, just a terrible thing. He was in tremendous pain obviously, and couldn’t breathe. It was very obvious to anybody that watched it. It was a very, very sad thing for me to see that. We also know that most policemen, you see the great job they do. They do a fantastic job, but this was a terrible insult to police and to policemen. And I know the Justice Department will, as you know it’s a local case, but I know the Justice Department is also looking at it very strongly.
Speaker 5: (47:05)
Does that change your views around, like the NFL protests?
President Donald Trump: (47:07)
Say that again? I can’t-
Speaker 5: (47:09)
Does that change your views around the NFL protest on this issue? They were peaceful protests. Does that change your stance on that at all?
President Donald Trump: (47:15)
Yeah, it should be a peaceful protest. I think really in memory of George Floyd, I think it should be peaceful. It’s terrible. I spoke with his family today, terrific people. I think it’s so bad for the memory when you see a thing like that going on, and hopefully that won’t happen tonight. And as you know, the National Guard has arrived and they’re there, but hopefully everything will be very different tonight. Last night was very sad on many different levels. Yeah, please. Yeah, please.
Speaker 6: (47:48)
[crosstalk 00:47:48] Rose Garden event, we see tensions with China over the virus, now over Hong Kong. Are we witnessing the start of a Cold War between the United States and China?
President Donald Trump: (47:58)
Well, we’re certainly not happy with what happened with respect to China. They have a virus that started then when it got out of control, perhaps I assume that’s what happened, it got out of control, whichever way and they stopped it from going to China, but they didn’t stop it from going to the rest of the world. So nobody likes that. That was not good. They did not do a good job. So I don’t know if it was incompetence or it was done for some other reason, but I know that I didn’t see anything in Beijing and I didn’t see anything in other Chinese cities, but I did see them in New York, in London, in Paris. We saw them in Spain and we saw them in Italy. We saw that the enemy, the invisible enemy come out and all over the world, 186 countries and probably more than that now. And they stopped it in China, but they didn’t stop it going to Europe and the United States and the rest of the world. So what’s that all about? And we have to do a very strong study and figure that out.
Speaker 6: (49:02)
If I could follow up, are you going to eliminate the special status for Hong Kong? I know you announced the measures.
President Donald Trump: (49:08)
We’re talking about doing a lot of things and we’re not. We’re very, very saddened by what happened to our relationship with China. They should have never allowed this to happen. They could have stopped it at the source. We asked them to come in and help them, and they didn’t want help from anybody. Even the World Health Organization, they wanted to go in and they were delayed, but we asked to go in very specifically and they didn’t want any help. They didn’t need any help. And then it got out of control in some form, but it didn’t seem to get out of control when it came to go into other parts of China, because it didn’t go very far, but it did come to the United States. It did come to Europe. It went all over the world.
Speaker 7: (49:49)
Mr. President, Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (49:49)
Yeah, please.
Speaker 8: (49:52)
During your conversation with the Floyd family after the Rose Garden event, what was the thing you were trying to impress on them and did they have a message for you?
President Donald Trump: (49:59)
Well, I just expressed my sorrow. That was a horrible thing to witness and I’ve seen bad things. I’ve seen many bad things and that was just a horrible thing to witness and to watch. And it would certainly look like there was no excuse for it.
Speaker 7: (50:16)
Mr. President, Mr. President.
Speaker 8: (50:16)
Did they have a message for you at all? Did they communicate-
President Donald Trump: (50:20)
They were grieving very much. It was their brother and they were grieving and I could see very much that they loved their brother.
Speaker 7: (50:30)
Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (50:30)
In the back, please go ahead.
Speaker 9: (50:32)
Thank you so much, Mr. President. The United States and Brazil right now have more cases of COVID-19 other than. I want-
President Donald Trump: (50:43)
Brazil, you said?
Speaker 9: (50:44)
Yes. My question is there are many comparisons between the way you and the Brazilian president handled the pandemic. Do you think it’s a fair comparison and how long do you think the travel ban will be in place?
President Donald Trump: (50:57)
Well, the Brazilian president is a friend of mine and he’s working very hard and they do have a big, big outbreak. And I can tell you, he’s a very good man and he loves his country incredibly well. They’ve had a hard time, there’s no question about it. They want a different route than we did.
Speaker 9: (51:13)
He is again-
President Donald Trump: (51:13)
We did a shut down, they decided to do it a different way. They’re having a very hard time.
Speaker 9: (51:18)
He is against social distancing at the moment where the Brazil-
President Donald Trump: (51:22)
Can you take that off, just for a second.
Speaker 9: (51:22)
Sure.
President Donald Trump: (51:23)
Yeah, it’s…
Speaker 9: (51:24)
He is against social distancing and lockdown at a moment where the numbers in Brazil are skyrocketing. What do you think about that?
President Donald Trump: (51:32)
Well, he went a different way. Brazil went a different way and certainly they’re having a hard time. I don’t want to be critical of anybody because I have great respect for him and he’s doing a very good job with the country then he got hit. He got hit like everybody else. They went about it differently than us. I closed down from China, I closed down from Europe and we did a lot of close downs. We had a close down from Brazil. You’re asking about Brazil, we closed down, as you know, the other night from Brazil. But it’s a tough time they’re having in Brazil. It’s a great country, great place, great people, but they’re having a very tough,
Speaker 9: (52:08)
How long would you think the ban had been place for Brazil?
President Donald Trump: (52:10)
I hope we-
Speaker 9: (52:10)
And are you also thinking Russia and India?
President Donald Trump: (52:12)
Yeah, I’d like to take the ban off as soon as we can. Okay? As soon as we can. Yes, please.
Speaker 7: (52:17)
Mr. President, do you believe that there’s a problem with police brutality in America? And if you do, what would you do about it?
President Donald Trump: (52:26)
Well, I think that police brutality certainly is something that we’ve been hearing about, reading about, studying, I have for many years and we all have to say, and I think most people would admit that most of the police, men and women, that I’ve seen have been outstanding. When you have something like this happen, you look at it and you just say, “How does a thing like that happen?” Because you just seem so bad to watch, but our police have been very outstanding. Our crime rates are way down right now in this country, and way down. The police have done a great job. Something like this happens and you really say it’s so bad in so many different ways and so unfortunate.
Speaker 7: (53:07)
You see the re-.
President Donald Trump: (53:08)
Yeah, please. Go ahead.
Speaker 10: (53:09)
Yes, Mr. President. It certainly seems like you’re sympathetic to some of the frustration expressed by the protesters last night. I want to ask you first off, do you think there were good people out protesting in Minneapolis last night?
President Donald Trump: (53:21)
Did you say were there good people?
Speaker 10: (53:23)
Were there good people among the protesters? And then also more broadly, what is your message to black Americans and others who just are really frustrated and saddened to see another video of a black man being killed in police custody?
President Donald Trump: (53:35)
Well, certainly there were a lot of different people and there were good people too and they were protesting and they were protesting for the right reason. They were protesting in honor of a man, George Floyd, where something happened that shouldn’t have happened. My opinion from what I’ve seen, certainly something happened that shouldn’t have happened. And yeah, you had a lot of people out there that were protesting out of sorrow. And then you had people that got out of control, some people, and I think they did a great disservice to their state and to their city and to really our country, what they did last night. And we brought in the National Guard today and they’re there and that won’t happen again. It can’t happen again. We can never let that happen again. That was run by the mayor of the city. In all fairness to him, he was in a tough position, but I don’t think they were very well prepared. But we brought in the National Guard. They’ll be very prepared tonight. Thank you all very much. Thank you, please. Thank you.
Speaker 7: (54:39)
Mr. President, would you support a civil Justice Department investigation? [crosstalk 00:12:41].
Speaker 11: (54:43)
Come on guys. Let’s go, quickly."
"May 21, 2020",4:04 P.M. EDT,"President Donald Trump: (00:00)
Jim, how are you?
Jim: (00:00)
Good to meet you.
President Donald Trump: (00:00)
Nice to see you.
Speaker 3: (00:03)
This is Mr. Lester from General Electric.
Mr. Lester: (00:03)
It’s nice to meet you, Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (00:03)
How’s our friend doing? Okay?
Mr. Lester: (00:03)
He’s good.
President Donald Trump: (00:03)
He’s doing well, right? They’re all doing well. They’re all doing well.
Speaker 3: (00:03)
So, they’re going to tell you really quickly what they’ve built here.
President Donald Trump: (00:03)
Okay, good.
Speaker 3: (00:03)
And the White House was superb [inaudible 00:00:21]. Vice President Pence-
President Donald Trump: (00:03)
Well this is a very important project. Please, go ahead.
Mr. Lester: (00:36)
Can I just start since day one? 60 days ago, we talked to supports on your staff around what the needs were, and it was around PPE. So, helping first responders but also clearly the charge for ventilators. So, maybe what I’ll do is just explain…
President Donald Trump: (00:37)
Go ahead. Please.
Speaker 5: (00:41)
From the GE side, we’ve been involved from day one of on ventilators side. So, Jim and I have been partners here-
President Donald Trump: (00:45)
How long have you been in GE?
Speaker 5: (00:47)
17 and a half years.
President Donald Trump: (00:48)
Very good.
Speaker 5: (00:49)
In the healthcare division the entire time.
President Donald Trump: (00:50)
Very good. Great company. It’s coming back?
Speaker 5: (00:54)
We’re doing well.
President Donald Trump: (00:54)
The engine thing has got to be tough though, right?
Speaker 5: (00:54)
The aircraft engines.
President Donald Trump: (00:54)
The airplane engines.
Speaker 5: (00:54)
Very tough.
President Donald Trump: (00:54)
That’s got to be tough because that was your-
Speaker 5: (00:54)
We had a huge market share.
President Donald Trump: (01:00)
That was your baby, right?
Speaker 5: (01:08)
It is. It is.
President Donald Trump: (01:08)
Exactly making too many planes.
Speaker 5: (01:08)
Servicing them.
President Donald Trump: (01:08)
But they’re making these.
Speaker 5: (01:09)
They’re making these.
President Donald Trump: (01:10)
So, go ahead.
Speaker 3: (01:11)
Actually, it’s all the stuff you see here, gowns, masks, face shields, face masks.
President Donald Trump: (01:16)
All right. Good. Are you making it all there?
Mr. Lester: (01:17)
Yeah, well actually in three different facilities.
President Donald Trump: (01:18)
Oh, yes.
Mr. Lester: (01:18)
So, it’s over 1000 UAW workers, all volunteers that are helping out.
President Donald Trump: (01:21)
That’s great. They’re all volunteers. Please.
Mr. Lester: (01:26)
Mr. President, our first thing is we wanted to move very, very quickly. The need was to move very fast, things like how do we help people. And one of the first gains we had with the administration said that the urge to contract the tension from the eyes, and we thought how would we actually help out with somebody who’s wearing a mask with more protection, so face masks. So what you see behind you is essentially the first week, we were producing face shields. This is an example of a face shield, and…
President Donald Trump: (02:00)
Can I see this? Anything unique about this?
Mr. Lester: (02:06)
It provides a…
President Donald Trump: (02:07)
Go ahead.
Mr. Lester: (02:12)
This photo behind you is a-
President Donald Trump: (02:13)
Is this any special kind of mask?
Mr. Lester: (02:13)
Well, it’s a cleanable plastic, basically, which means it had produced at high speeds. So, this is four weeks later. It can give you a [inaudible 00:02:25]. In less than 30 days, we were building four million face shields a week at [crosstalk 00:02:32].
President Donald Trump: (02:45)
That’s fantastic.
President Donald Trump: (02:45)
Will you keep doing that after the [inaudible 00:02:42]? You think it-
Mr. Lester: (02:45)
Our leadership-
William Ford, Jr.: (02:45)
Well, we could for as long as it’s needed, I think.
President Donald Trump: (02:47)
There’ll be a time when you’ll have it.
Jim: (02:48)
If you tell us, we’ll fill the cupboards.
President Donald Trump: (02:51)
Yeah, that’s great. You did really a good job quickly.
Mr. Lester: (02:54)
Well, that was the thing that was-
President Donald Trump: (02:57)
Hello everybody. Hi.
Carol Cain: (02:58)
Mr. President, can I ask you a question?
President Donald Trump: (02:58)
Yeah.
Carol Cain: (02:58)
So my question to you is this. Thanks to all the work of manufacturers like Ford and-
President Donald Trump: (03:07)
Who are you with?
Carol Cain: (03:08)
I’m Carol Cain with CBS in Detroit and Detroit Free Press.
President Donald Trump: (03:09)
Good, good. Very good.
Carol Cain: (03:12)
My question to you is this. Because of all the ventilators being made here at Ford, and the heroic efforts of all the manufacturers there at [inaudible 00:03:20], we now know we have enough manufacturing going on for the time being as far as the ventilator goes. You said you think we have enough, in fact, can share with other countries. My question to you, sir, is looking six months from now, a year from now, how much do we need to keep back in our stockpile to keep us safe?
President Donald Trump: (03:38)
You know, we were just talking about it. We have a very big stockpile right now and we’re building it bigger and we’re helping a lot of other countries. Nigeria, we just sent a thousand. We have various, various countries, France, Spain. We have a lot going to Italy. We have a lot going to a different, probably 15, 18 countries. They’re calling us. We had the capacity to do this. Nobody else did. So every state now has more than they need, and our stockpile is totally full. We have a tremendous amount. So now we’re really helping other countries where they’re losing a lot of people because they don’t have ventilators. Ventilators are hard to do, and I want to say that Ford and General Electric have done an incredible job working together. And also the companies that work with you, they really did a great job.
President Donald Trump: (04:29)
They do a great car and they really did a great job on the ventilators. And I hear that the quality of the ventilator has been really top of the line.
William Ford, Jr.: (04:38)
Thank you.
Speaker 7: (04:38)
Mr. President-
President Donald Trump: (04:38)
We really appreciate it, fellas. Good job.
Speaker 7: (04:41)
Mr. President, there was a lot of interest about whether you would end up wearing a mask today. Could you just take us through your thought process of why you decided not to wear a mask?
President Donald Trump: (04:51)
Well, I had one on before. I wore one in this back area, but I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it, but no, where I had it in the back area, I did put a mask on.
Speaker 7: (05:01)
Did you have the goggles on too, as well, sir?
President Donald Trump: (05:03)
I did. I had goggles, goggles and a mask right back there.
Speaker 7: (05:06)
Why would you not be-
President Donald Trump: (05:07)
And here’s another one.
Speaker 7: (05:08)
Why would you not be wearing it-
President Donald Trump: (05:10)
Because in this area… You take it.
Speaker 7: (05:11)
Why would you not be wearing it here, sir?
President Donald Trump: (05:13)
Not necessary here. Everybody’s been tested and I’ve been tested. In fact, I was tested this morning, so it’s not necessary.
Speaker 7: (05:19)
But the [crosstalk 00:05:20] executives are wearing them.
President Donald Trump: (05:22)
Well, that’s their choice. I was given a choice and I had one on in an area where they preferred it. So I put it on and it was very nice. It looked very nice, but they said they’re not necessary here. Yeah, please.
Speaker 8: (05:39)
What about the example that it would set for other Americans to see you wearing a mask?
President Donald Trump: (05:40)
Well, I think it sets an example both ways. And as they say, I did have it on. Thank you. Yeah, please.
Carol Cain: (05:45)
Mr. President.
President Donald Trump: (05:50)
I just liked your question so much. You know what, it was such a nice question.
Carol Cain: (05:53)
No, it was a great question. Here’s a question for you. So, you have seen-
President Donald Trump: (05:56)
I’ll take an extra question.
Carol Cain: (05:57)
There we go.
President Donald Trump: (05:57)
Go ahead.
Carol Cain: (05:58)
We’ve seen the manufacturers here, Ford, GM, [inaudible 00:00:06:00], others, small businesses, turning things overnight and making PPE materials. As someone who is the President of the United States, in terms of our manufacturing might, how do you see what’s taken place in these last months?
President Donald Trump: (06:12)
This is the biggest mobilization since World War II, and these people were in charge of it. They did it. They did a fantastic job. They did a really fantastic job and we appreciate it. All of these companies, they came together and they used to make cars here. They used to make other things here. And now not only the ventilators, but you’re saying the masks and all of the other… What other product do you make? It’s the head of Ford, by the way. Not bad. Not a bad position.
William Ford, Jr.: (06:39)
Thank you. So, we’ve got-
President Donald Trump: (06:40)
You know, she’s a very nice woman.
William Ford, Jr.: (06:41)
I know. Hi Carol. How are you?
Carol Cain: (06:43)
Hi Bill. How are you doing?
William Ford, Jr.: (06:43)
Well, you know what we’re making. We’ve got the pressure respirators, obviously the ventilators, the masks, the gowns, really anything that anybody needs. We responded quickly and we’re very proud of our workforce. They’ve been amazing.
President Donald Trump: (06:56)
Is he doing a good job?
Carol Cain: (06:58)
He is. In fact, Bill, you have been through so many crises through your years as Chairman and CEO of the company here. How does this crisis, dealing with this pandemic, making PPE materials compare?
William Ford, Jr.: (07:10)
Well, everyone’s different. I mean, I won’t take you through all of them going all the way back to maybe the oil shocks and then the dot com meltdowns and all those. Every crisis is different, but what’s amazing is how our people responded. And this one, they didn’t wait to be asked to do something. They said, “Here’s an opportunity, and let’s go.” What I love about our culture is they didn’t ask for permission. They just went, and that’s something that we’ve done throughout our 117 year history, and I hope we’ll always do.
Speaker 10: (07:39)
Mr. President-
Speaker 7: (07:41)
Mr. Ford, can we ask you another question?
President Donald Trump: (07:42)
By the way, here is my mask right here [crosstalk 00:07:44], and I liked it very much. I actually, honestly, I think I look better in the mask. I really did. I look better in the mask, [crosstalk 00:07:53] but I’m making a speech so I won’t have it now, but I did have it on right here. And I think some of you might’ve gotten a shot. Thank you very much.
Speaker 7: (08:01)
Mr. Ford, can you confirm that the President was told it’s okay not to wear one in this area?
William Ford, Jr.: (08:07)
It’s up to him.
Mr. Lester: (08:16)
It basically keeps the occupants safe. It takes in fresh air.
President Donald Trump: (08:16)
Oh, that’s great.
Mr. Lester: (08:16)
And we used automotive components, so we heard the message that we needed to go quickly. We built 32,000 of these respirators, and we’ve shipped 887 [crosstalk 00:08:28] –
President Donald Trump: (08:28)
Is that like a seatbelt something there?
Mr. Lester: (08:29)
If you walk around here, you can see the respirator. It just holds the respirator, so. On the first day when we had this conversation, in the drawing, we said how do we use automotive components to go quick? And so we got about a fan of a highly controlled seat in the F150. We take a battery pack off of a Dewalt tool from the battery source, and then a filter to filter the air for the occupant.
President Donald Trump: (08:54)
I hear it’s a very high grade ventilator.
William Ford, Jr.: (08:57)
Yeah, it’s great. It is. They’ve done a great job. I mean, the ventilator and the respirator, they’re really, really neat. What’s also amazing is how many our team can make. I mean that’s one thing the auto industry-
President Donald Trump: (09:11)
So how many will you make a week, ventilators?
Mr. Lester: (09:16)
Ventilators, we’re ramping up to 6,000 a week.
President Donald Trump: (09:20)
So folks, that’s 6,000 ventilators a week. Think of that. From a running start, which wasn’t much of a run, actually. So we had very few in this country, almost none. We were not in that business and now they’re making thousands a week. Great thing. What about this?
Mr. Lester: (09:37)
So, we built 32,000 of these already.
President Donald Trump: (09:37)
Wow.
Mr. Lester: (09:37)
So, we’ll be able to go 12,000 a week.
President Donald Trump: (09:40)
Is that full proof, would you say?
Mr. Lester: (09:46)
Basically this is the maximum protection for an occupant.
President Donald Trump: (09:48)
Maximum.
Mr. Lester: (09:48)
Maximum. It basically blows filtered air, filters out the virus over there over the occupant’s face, so if they’re in a large ICU ward, or they’re in one of these makeshift ICU wards, and there’s a lot of virus could be in the air, this would give them the maximum protection.
President Donald Trump: (10:03)
We got to get back to the rallies. Do you agree with that, John? We got to have the rallies.
John: (10:08)
One question, Mr. President. One question. The Secretary of the Treasury said there is a strong likelihood that we’ll need another fiscal stimulus. To your thinking, what shape would that take?
President Donald Trump: (10:18)
I think we will. I think we’re going to be helping people out. We’re going to be getting some money for them during the artificial… Because it really is. It’s an artificial closure and now we’re going to be able to open it up.
President Donald Trump: (10:28)
This isn’t like for long term problems and it takes years and years to have it come back. The depression took 12 years, more, 14, 15 years. We’re going to be back next year, maybe even in the fourth quarter, in a few months, we’re going to be back. Because we closed it and now we open it. But I would say there could be one more nice shot, one more nice dose.
John: (10:52)
What do you think should be in it?
President Donald Trump: (10:54)
Well, I’d let you know and I know exactly, but I’d rather do it at the appropriate time.
John: (10:58)
We know what payroll tax cuts-
President Donald Trump: (10:59)
Today we’re celebrating these great companies doing ventilators and other equipment, but we have a very, very specific plan, and it’ll be great for the American people, and our economy’s going to be back soon, and Ford and General Electric and these great companies that helped us so much in a time of need, they’re going to be very happy. And you’re already gearing up. I know you’re gearing up. Your lines are starting to roll making cars again. So a lot of things are happening.
President Donald Trump: (11:27)
By the way, on our southern border, it’s never been so secure. We’re up to almost 200 miles of wall and we have never had, that whole area, nobody comes through that area. The area where the wall goes up, that’s the end of that.
John: (11:42)
And so you’re having this speech here this afternoon. What are you thinking about in terms of campaign rounds? When will you be able to get back to doing rallies?
President Donald Trump: (11:48)
So, as soon as you’re able to have people get in. We’ve never had an empty seat since the day I came down the escalator with our future First Lady, we’ve never had an empty seat. You know that. And we’d have thousands of people we sent away. And I think the demand now from what we see is greater than ever before. We’re going to have to go to certain states where we’re able to… Look, I don’t want to have a stadium where you’re supposed to have a person and then seven empty seats and then another person.
President Donald Trump: (12:15)
So we might do some outdoor big ones, and we may also just wait until the stadiums can open up. I think it’s going to be soon. We’ll go to a place like Florida. We’ll go to a place like maybe Georgia, some other place where they’re going to be opening up. Whoever opens up first. The demand has been incredible to get going with the rallies. I just hear the music in the background. I’m saying we’ve had rallies like nobody’s ever had, and we would love to get back to that. I think it’s going to be sooner rather than later.
John: (12:47)
And I know you were asked about this briefly this morning, this new AstraZeneca vaccine from Oxford that HHS has invested $1 billion in, how much promise do you think that holds for an early vaccination progress?
President Donald Trump: (13:00)
I think it holds tremendous promise, but we have many other companies who are just about as far along. We have many companies. We have the greatest pharmaceutical companies in the world. They’re equally, you know what I mean? They’re really in a position and I’m not only talking about vaccine. I’m talking about cures and therapeutics. Therapeutically, we have some things coming out which we think are going to be great, but they have to be tested quickly. And we’re doing it very quickly.
John: (13:28)
Who would get the vaccine first? First responders, elderly people?
President Donald Trump: (13:31)
Right now, what we’re doing is we’re setting logistically with our military, our military is in gear so that we can give 150, 200 million shots quickly. The military is in gear. We can move a couple of hundred thousand soldiers immediately in time of emergency. So this is not nearly as big a deal is that it’s equally as important perhaps, but it’s not as tough logistically.
John: (14:00)
But how would you prioritize it?
President Donald Trump: (14:03)
I’ll sit down with a lot of people and we’ll figure it out. We’re going to sit down with the military and we hope to be in that position fairly soon. So rather than having the vaccine, doing the tests and then starting to gear up, we’re taking a risk. Because you know, it could be that if something happened, but I don’t think that’s going to be. But in addition to that company, we have other companies that are very far advanced. And also don’t forget, therapeutics and cure. We’re talking about a vaccine in this case, but therapeutics and cure.
President Donald Trump: (14:31)
I mean, frankly, that’s my first choice, because that would take care of people that are in trouble right now. Okay?
Speaker 7: (14:37)
Mr. President, on the issue of testing, there’s been questions about whether you’re satisfied or not with what the CDC is doing, the work they’re doing, particularly the director, Dr. Redfield. Can you address that? Are you satisfied with the work CDC-
President Donald Trump: (14:48)
I think they’re doing a good job, a really good job in a very complex situation. You know, we started off, nobody knew what the virus was. It came in from China and nobody knew what it was. And frankly, I think they’ve done a really good job. I’m very happy about it. A lot of other people think they’ve done a lot of great work. We’re now up to, and this is beyond even CDC, because we’ve done it between Jared Cushner and a lot of geniuses coming in from Silicon Valley, and a lot of people, these companies where they could make ventilators.
President Donald Trump: (15:20)
Look, what we did with ventilators is incredible because we geared up in a short period of time through General Electric, Ford, they’re represented here at the top level, through other companies. We were at Honeywell the other day. They make masks. Who would think Honeywell is making a mask? But that’s what they’re making now is a mask. It’s a very high tech company. You know, they make the dashboards to an airplane and lots of other things. And now they’re making masks. Our companies geared up so quickly, so fast. Honeywell opened a plant in three weeks from literally zero to open making masks in three weeks. It’s been an incredible achievement. There’s never been anything done like this since the end of World War II.
John: (16:04)
You said a number of weeks ago, we can’t let the cure become worse than the disease.
President Donald Trump: (16:09)
That’s true.
John: (16:10)
Where are we in that calculus?
President Donald Trump: (16:11)
I think I was the first one to say it. I don’t know. Wouldn’t you say that I was the first one? But you can’t let the cure become worse than the problem itself.
John: (16:19)
And where are we?
President Donald Trump: (16:21)
I think the governors have to start opening up. We now know the disease. We know the weaknesses and the strengths. We know that older people are affected gravely, and younger people are not affected gravely, frankly. You look at the statistics. It’s incredible. And we know that we have to protect some people much more so. I think a lot of the governors have done a very, very poor job on nursing homes, but they’ve done a good job on other things. I know every governor. I can grade every governor. But we’ve made a lot of hero governors. We’ve done a great job for the governors and my relationship with them in almost all cases is very good.
President Donald Trump: (17:02)
And remember this. One of the beauties we were just talking about, not one person who needed a ventilator didn’t get a ventilator.
John: (17:09)
But with another 2.4 million people claiming first time unemployment insurance benefits today, how close are we to the cure being worse than the disease?
President Donald Trump: (17:19)
I think that a lot of these states are going to, the ones that are sort of sticking to a certain very rigid pattern, I think they’re going to stop. I don’t think that people are going to stand for it. This is a country that’s meant to be open, not closed. And we did the right thing, John. We saved millions of lives, millions and millions of lives. You would have had anywhere from a million five to two million, five, three million lives, think of it. So if we were at a hundred thousand, instead of a hundred thousand, multiply that times 15, 20 or 25, it wouldn’t have been acceptable. It wouldn’t have been sustainable. You couldn’t have done it. So we’ve called it right, and now I want it open and we’re going to open. And if there’s a fire, an ember, a flame some place, we put it out.
President Donald Trump: (18:04)
But the people have done a great job, and General Electric, Ford and all the other people that work with them have done fantastic work. And Honeywell, again, I was there last week. But Honeywell, they’ve done fantastically also. Okay? Thank you very much.
Speaker 13: (18:17)
Mr. President, you mentioned that embers, right, smaller fires, those pockets of the virus popping up. Are you concerned about a potential second wave of this virus?
President Donald Trump: (18:27)
People say that’s a very distinct possibility. It’s standard. And we’re going to put out the fires. We’re not going to close the country. We’re going to put out the fires. There could be, whether it’s an ember or a flame, we’re going to put it out, but we’re not closing our country. Thank you very much.
Speaker 14: (18:39)
Are you looking to replace Dr. Redfield or his [inaudible 00:18:43]?
President Donald Trump: (18:39)
No."
"May 20, 2020",Uknown,"Donald Trump : (00:00)
… of his balance, you know all about harvesting and they do lots of bad things. Ideally people go out and they vote. Now, if you need a mail in ballot, if you need a specific… As an example, I’m in the white house and I have to send a ballot to Florida. That makes sense. So if you need it for some reason, or if somebody is not, well. That’s one thing. But when you send out 7.7 million, mail in ballots, there’s forgeries, there’s frankly, duplication, where they print ballots on the same kind of paper with the same kind of machinery. And you can’t tell the difference and they send in thousands and thousands of fake ballots. I tell you what, this nation can’t be going down that path because it’s a very dangerous path to go down. Now, we just won a big election.
Donald Trump : (00:45)
You probably heard about this one in California. California, 25, Mike Garcia. He just won a very big election and that was ballots. It was a very sort of the opposite. They won the case for ballots. He was doing very well because their ballots you see, he was way ahead in an area that frankly was not expected to go Republican. First time in 22 years, that it has happened. They flipped from Democrat to Republican California. The first time in 22 years, that it had happened. They actually put machines in there, in the last three days, because they thought meaning the Democrats, because they thought that might happen, but it didn’t. But that was the case. That was a positive case. But mail in ballots are very dangerous is tremendous fraud involved and tremendous illegality.
Speaker 1: (01:30)
But they are many Republicans secretaries of state that are also moving to mail in ballots because of the pandemic and people are scared to go vote.
Donald Trump : (01:38)
Well, we’re going to see how it all works out, but they had 7.7 million applications sent out. They have, in the state of Nevada, they have a tremendous drive in where you just mail in your balance. You can’t do that. You got to go and vote. People have to check you. They have to see that it’s you, they’re supposed to look at you and check you and make sure that… I mean, when you get thousands of ballots and they put them in a bag and they just bring them in and people start counting. Who knows where they come from. It’s so obvious. I mean, frankly, they should have voter ID. That’s what they should have. You really want to know what the country wants, the country wants voter ID otherwise it’s going to be subject to tremendous illegality and fraud.
Dr. Birx: (02:24)
Mr. President-
Speaker 3: (02:24)
Mr. President what fundings that are withdrawn for Michigan?
Donald Trump : (02:28)
From?
Speaker 3: (02:29)
From Michigan. You threatened to keep funding away from state of Michigan which funding are [crosstalk 00:02:34]
Donald Trump : (02:33)
Yeah. Well, I have very specific funding. I just spoke with the governor. We didn’t discuss that. We really discussed more the topic at hand plus the dams breaking. So we didn’t. But we’ll let you know if it’s necessary. You’ll be finding out… They’ll be finding out very soon if it’s necessary. I don’t think it’s going to be necessary because mail in ballots are a very dangerous thing. They’re subject to massive fraud. And by the way, I don’t want to put anybody on the spot if you have anything to say about it, so. Or Laura, but how can you do that? People signing ballots, who knows, who signing these ballots, they have a ballot, they pick the ballot, they take them out of mailboxes. They go around and accumulate them. They harvest, I guess the word is harvest them. And it was especially prevalent in California. It’s just not a fair situation. Do you have any comments on that?
Asa Hutchinson: (03:25)
Well, I do, of course, Arkansas supported a voter ID law.
Donald Trump : (03:29)
Good.
Asa Hutchinson: (03:30)
But in terms of the election in November, there’s a lot of discussion about how we can make the vote accessible. If there is continued worry from a health standpoint and we want to be able to use no excuse absentee voting as a way to do it. But it’s still a person to person identification of the individual versus the mail in variety that is, you said can be manipulated.
Donald Trump : (04:00)
Sure.
Asa Hutchinson: (04:00)
So we’re looking at that, but we believe in the identification of the vote.
Donald Trump : (04:06)
I think just common sense would tell you that it’s massive manipulation can take place. Massive. And you do, you have cases of fraudulent ballots where they actually print them and they give them to people to sign. Maybe the same person signs them with different writing, different pens. I don’t know. A lot of things can happen. Now, if you can, you should go and vote. Voting is an honor. It shouldn’t be something where they send you a pile of stuff and you send it back. Another thing that happens, a lot of people in certain districts, this is historically, a lot of people in certain districts don’t ever get their ballot. They keep calling, “Where’s my vote. Where’s my ballot.” Then election day passes and they forget about it. That can happen in the thousands. I’m not saying it does, but I can. It probably has.
Speaker 3: (04:51)
Just to follow up on that, sir. Are you concerned about the message that you’re sending of saying you may withhold funding from Michigan when it’s also going through these issues with the water [crosstalk 00:05:01]-
Donald Trump : (05:00)
No, I’m not. No, no. I’m not concerned at all. We’re going to help Michigan. Michigan is a great state. I’ve gotten tremendous business to go to Michigan. Michigan is one of the reasons I ran. I was honored in Michigan long before I thought about… I was honored as the man of the year at Michigan at a big event. I got up and I remember so well, I spoke probably five, six years before I even thought about running for president. I got up and I spoke and I said, “Why are you allowing them to steal your car business?” We lost 32% of our car business to Mexico. A lot of it came out of Michigan and I said, “Why did you allow that to happen?” I posed many questions to Michigan that not… I think made it quite an impression.
Donald Trump : (05:44)
And now we have those same car factories that coming back except in a brand newer and bigger form. So I think we’re going to do very well in Michigan. I guess we just got a poll that’s very good right here. A very good poll about how we’re doing in Michigan and other swing States and just generally in the election. But I won’t show you. I’m sure you can get it. I won’t flip this over. Everyone is saying, “Could you flip it over?” But no, I think we’re doing very well in Michigan. Very great place. I’ll be there tomorrow and I guess it’s tomorrow, but I’ll be there tomorrow Ford Plant. And maybe going to do the double stop or I’ll go back on the dams, but we have to take care of that problem.
Dr. Birx: (06:24)
Mr. President, with 4% of the world’s population and 30% of the outbreak, what would you have done differently facing this crisis?
Donald Trump : (06:33)
Well, nothing. If you take New York and New Jersey, which were very hard hit, we were very, very low. In terms of morbidity and in terms of… You look at the death, relatively speaking, we’re at the lowest level, along with Germany. Germany, us, it could have been some smaller countries too, perhaps. I’d like to ask you maybe about that, if I could. But we’ve done amazingly well. I think the biggest thing we did is stopping the inflow from China into our country. And Deborah was a big supporter of that. I mean, in terms of how important it turned out to be and so was Tony Fauci. They were very, very… Tony said we saved thousands and thousands of lives. That was a great decision that was made. And that was made very early, please, Deborah.
Dr. Birx: (07:23)
Yeah, I think it’s always confusing, particularly confusing to the American people. We don’t emphasize the size of our country. We’re the third largest country in the world, but every country has a different experience with this virus. So you have to adjust everything to population size. So when you look at Spain and Italy, our attack rates to this virus are identical to other countries that have experienced the type of epidemic that we have experienced. So every country is different. That’s why you really need to always report data normalized for population. And then you look at the mortality by population and it’s true. We have compared to our European colleagues, some of the lowest mortality, about half of Italy and Spain. So I think it’s really important that. And then these two States represent what we’ve been asking States to do. And Kansas, they found 50% of their clusters were in specific meat packing, nursing homes.
Donald Trump : (08:21)
Good job.
Dr. Birx: (08:21)
They identified their clusters, they found their clusters. They took care of those clusters. That was 50% of all of their cases in Arkansas, 80% of the Arkansas individuals have recovered with less than a 2% mortality. So these are the… It’s really important. We’re a big country, but each state is different, but as a country, we’re different than other countries around the world. We’ll be asking questions later about why were certain countries completely spared? I think that’s always a question that we have epidemiology is like that. But if your country has never had significant infections, you can’t compare it to a global number. There’s multiple countries in Africa where there’s really almost no outbreak. And then South Africa has a very different outbreak. So each of these outbreaks are different and that’s why it has to be really granular to understand it and to respond to it. You can see these two states have done exactly what we asked them to do, find cases, contact trace, contain outbreaks, and ensure that their citizens do as well as possible. That’s what these states illustrate.
Donald Trump : (09:30)
Just to finish your question, I mean, so we’re in that category along with Germany as the lowest. I think it’s a great honor. That’s including New York and New Jersey, which have had a very high number. So if you include New York, New Jersey, do… If you don’t include New York and New Jersey, we’re just about in a class by ourselves.
Dr. Birx: (09:53)
What about China and [crosstalk 00:09:54]?
Donald Trump : (09:55)
Well, China you tell me about, do you think they’re right numbers? Do you think China has given the right number? I don’t think so. I don’t think so.
Dr. Birx: (10:02)
[crosstalk 00:10:02].
Donald Trump : (10:02)
Take a look at the numbers, they gave numbers it was so low. I mean, I saw more problem on television that they were reporting just by looking at a picture. So I’m not including China and any numbers because those numbers weren’t correct obviously. That’s been easily shown and easily proven, but no, our people have done a fantastic job. Deborah, I always talk about the fact that our testing is so far advanced that we’re close to 14 million in testing. 14 million. Would you say China is that… Not China, if you would say Germany would be maybe three or four, three.
Dr. Birx: (10:40)
I can tell you certainly.
Donald Trump : (10:42)
South Korea is at a number, you tell us what that number is.
Dr. Birx: (10:46)
Well, we’ve been way ahead of South Korea for a long time.
Donald Trump : (10:49)
Way ahead of everybody.
Dr. Birx: (10:50)
Germany has done three million tests, Italy three million tests, UK about 2.7 million, Spain three million. I think to us, it’s not just the number of tests, it’s how those tests are utilized. I think in both of these states, you can see, they focus testing where they knew the outbreaks were. Now they’re proactively testing in nursing homes where they think the outbreaks, could go next and finding asymptomatic cases. I think we’ve only learned in the last couple of months, how many asymptomatic cases there are.
Dr. Birx: (11:24)
I think a lot of people at the beginning wanted to approach this like flu and most of the people who get flu are symptomatic. So really I think our thoughts have evolved, our understanding has evolved and the states have evolved with us. Really working in partnership to really change how we look for cases. I think that’s really remarkable. We’re not waiting for people to get sick, to find cases now. What you’re doing with testing and what you’re doing with testing in a proactive way is the way we’re moving as a country. And because we can do nearly 14 million tests, we have the luxury to be able to be proactive in our testing now.
Donald Trump : (12:02)
But when you do 14 million…
Dr. Birx: (12:03)
…be proactive in our testing now.
Donald Trump : (12:03)
But when you do 14 million tests, you’re going to find more cases. If instead of 14 million tests, we did 3 million… Like Germany’s at about 3 million, South Korea is at 3 million and they’ve done a very good job. It’s not a knock, but we’re at almost 14 million. We’re going to be passing 14 million very soon. So you’re going to have more tests. If we did 3 million, everyone say, “Oh, we’re doing great,” in terms of cases, we’re going to have more cases. Maybe that’s what we should have done, if I would have been 3 million they’d have said, “Oh, they have very few cases. United States is doing well.”
Donald Trump : (12:35)
We’re finding a lot of people. By doing testing, you’re finding people. So we’re doing 14, Germany’s doing 3, South Korea’s doing 3. And I think they’re number two and three, so we’re way ahead of everybody. But when you do that, you have more cases. So, a lot of times the fake news media will say, “You know, there are a lot of cases in the United States.” Well, if we didn’t do testing at a level that nobody’s ever dreamt possible, you wouldn’t have very many cases. So we’re finding a lot of cases and we’re doing a great job once we find them. Okay. Thank you, very much, everybody.
Speaker 4: (13:10)
[crosstalk 00:13:10] Press, lets go. Come on guys, we’re finished. Press, let’s move.
Speaker 5: (13:13)
Press let’s go, thank you.
Speaker 6: (13:17)
[crosstalk 00:13:17] how does it compare the per capita basis? Obviously, the United States is much larger than a lot of these European countries. How does our testing compare per capita?
Donald Trump : (13:22)
Yeah, sure. Do you want to do that Deborah? Per capita.
Dr. Birx: (13:26)
Our testing now, we’re almost up to 4%. So some of the European countries are at 4 to 5 percent. Our goal is to ensure that we can find the asymptomatics. And I think that’s really our focus right now, working with every state to really help them identify where these clusters came from historically, and then proactively going for those clusters. Identifying them early and finding the asymptomatic individuals before. And no one’s intending to spread the virus, I always want to be very clear about that. Asymptomatic people don’t know they’re infected, and so together we’re really working to find them. It’s a unique challenge, and I think together we’re really making progress.
Donald Trump : (14:10)
When you see “per capita,” there’s many per capitas. Is it’s like, “Per capita relative to what?” But you could look at just about any category, and we’re really at the top. Meaning positive on a per capita basis, too. They’ve done a great job. Please, Kaitlan.
Kaitlan: (14:25)
I heard yesterday at the Republican lunch that you were complaining about the CDC and the delayed rollout of testing. Do you think that-
Donald Trump : (14:32)
No. I wasn’t complaining, I don’t know who gave you that? It’s fake news.
Kaitlan: (14:35)
Do you think Robert Redfield is doing a good leading the CDC?
Donald Trump : (14:37)
Yeah, I do. I do. It’s fake news, Kaitlan. Fake news, therefore you can report it on CNN. It’s perfect for CNN.
Kaitlan: (14:44)
You didn’t complain about the CDC [crosstalk 00:02:49].
Donald Trump : (14:46)
No, not at all.
Kaitlan: (14:47)
Do you think they did a good job with testing at the beginning?
Donald Trump : (14:50)
You know, you’re asking me a wise guy question. Again I didn’t put CDC there, CDC has been there long before the Trump Administration came in. But they had a test that something happened to it, it was soiled-
Kaitlan: (15:05)
Contaminated.
Donald Trump : (15:06)
It was soiled and or foiled. But it was a problem, a short term problem. It lasted for about a week and then they got that solved. And frankly, the end result is… And this was done outside of CDC. This was done by private companies and people that we got involved. And you look at the numbers, I know you don’t like to talk about the numbers of what we’ve done, but for the first week they had a problem, CDC, because something went wrong with one of the tests. And that can happen, I’m not blaming CDC for it.
Donald Trump : (15:37)
No, I think he’s done a very good job I think. I think that my whole team has done a very good job. And it’s not really my team, they were there. CDC has been there for a long time. There’s some great talent in CDC, I deal with them.
Donald Trump : (15:50)
So now what you’re saying is, “Okay, we’ve done 14 million tests. So we can’t hit the President on that. So let’s go back to the first week.” CDC has done, I think, a really good job. No, and I didn’t say anything bad about CDC at the meeting. We actually had a very good meeting. The Republican party, the senators, I think virtually everyone was there. I think you had 53 there.
Donald Trump : (16:13)
We had a great meeting. We’re looking to do great things for the country. We’re helping people with stimulus. We’re getting money to people, they need it. We’re going to open up very big. I call it “transition to greatness.” That’s what it is, it’s a transition to greatness. And when Larry Kudlow tells you the numbers, those are really surprisingly good numbers this early in. I mean, we’re doing very well. I think it’s going to be something special.
Donald Trump : (16:38)
These are two governors that we invited. They’ve both done a fantastic job. One happens to be a Democrat, one happens to be a Republican. You’ve been on most of those calls Laura and I think we can say the Democrats have been as nice about what we’ve done as the Republicans. I mean, it’s been terrific. And Laura, I know she will speak her mind and so will some of the others. And if she was unhappy, she’d be letting you know.
Donald Trump : (17:05)
We’ve done a really great job. We’ve gotten along great with Democrats, the Democrat governors. And we’ve gotten along great with the Republicans. It’s been a tremendous thing to witness and we’re doing a fantastic job with… And you have been fantastic Deborah, I have to say. You’ve been working 24 hours a day and I hope people appreciate what you’re doing, but I do. I do. Thank you, very much.
Speaker 4: (17:28)
All right, press, let’s go. [crosstalk 00:17:31] Come on Kaitlan, we’re done. Let’s go.
Donald Trump : (17:38)
Thank you, very much.
Speaker 4: (17:38)
Ben, let’s move. [crosstalk 00:17:38]
Kaitlan: (17:38)
Are you done-
Speaker 5: (17:38)
Kaitlan, Kaitlan.
Speaker 4: (17:38)
Come on, let’s go. We’re finished.
Kaitlan: (17:38)
Have you finished the hydroxychloroquine?
Donald Trump : (17:40)
I think the regimen finishes in a day or two. I think it’s two days, two days.
Speaker 4: (17:45)
All right, let’s go.
Donald Trump : (17:48)
Thank you. Great job. [crosstalk 00:17:49] There is a man that has great talent right here, that guy. [crosstalk 00:17:49] He’s actually, he’s very talented.
Donald Trump : (17:53)
[inaudible 00:18:33].
Donald Trump : (17:53)
Hi, Larry.
Larry Kudlow: (17:53)
Sir.
Donald Trump : (18:37)
[inaudible 00:18:37] Hi, good job.
Donald Trump : (18:38)
Well, thank you very much. It’s an honor to have Asa Hutchinson, the Governor of Arkansas. We all know Asa and he’s been doing a tremendous job. Likewise, Governor Laura Kelly of Kansas, a terrific state, terrific people, hard workers. That’s for sure. Right? Hard workers. And we’re going to be discussing various things. I guess everything you can imagine. And we’ve been doing some of these meetings with the governors. Our relationship with the governors has been very strong. We’ve sent them everything they’ve needed and we’ll continue. I just spoke with Gretchen Whitmer, we’ll be going to Michigan at the appropriate time. They have a big problem with the dams breaking, you saw that. It’s a big, big problem. And so we’ve sent FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers out, and they’re very good at dams. They’re probably better at dams than anybody you can think of. Right? The Army Corps of Engineers, they’ve done a fantastic job all over.
Donald Trump : (19:38)
I’ll be going to Michigan at some point in the not too distant future. I’m also actually going to Ford tomorrow, come to think of it. And I think they called the Governor, invited the Governor. So, we’ll be heading out. Maybe we’ll do them both at the same time, I don’t want to get in the way of the fix-up though, because there’s a lot of water out there. It was a bad break, so we’ll be taking care of that in Michigan. And Michigan, these are great people and great survivors. When you get right down to it Larry, they’ve been through a lot over the years. Now we have a lot of auto factories being built there and a lot of good things are happening.
Donald Trump : (20:16)
States are opening up some rapidly, safely, and we look forward to that. And I think we’re going to get back. We’re going to have some very good numbers, I project. I think that we will have a great transition period, which is third quarter. I think you’re going to have a very good fourth quarter. I think you’re going to have an incredible year. You may have something to say about that, Larry, because you just got some numbers that are quite important. Go ahead.
Larry Kudlow: (20:40)
The Congressional Budget Office has just redone its estimates. After a predictably rough pandemic contraction in the second quarter, they’re looking for a twenty-one and a half percent growth rate, Sir, in the third quarter.
Donald Trump : (21:00)
Good.
Larry Kudlow: (21:00)
Which would actually, if it can true, would be the biggest growth quarter in American history, or since the data were compiled.
Donald Trump : (21:09)
I could see that happening.
Larry Kudlow: (21:09)
In the fourth quarter over 10%, and actually they’re showing 2021 now at 4.2%. So they’ve lifted their estimates. That would be a wonderful thing, really would.
Donald Trump : (21:22)
Those are big numbers. That would be incredible. That tells you what’s happening and that’s why the stock market’s as good as it is.
Larry Kudlow: (21:30)
Yep.
Donald Trump : (21:30)
Because, a lot of smart people that are projecting some very good results for this country. Laura, would you like to say something? You have these wonderful people right here and they’d love to hear from you Governor, please.
Laura Kelly: (21:42)
I do. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the invitation here today, and I appreciate what your team has done for us-
Donald Trump : (21:51)
Thank you.
Laura Kelly: (21:51)
… as we have been working our way through this pandemic and the recovery. I think one of the most significant things that has happened was when we put out a cry for help with our meat packing plants, you sent in a CDC SWAT team that came into Southwest Kansas where we have multiple meat packing plants and really helped us set up the kind of system that we needed to have in place to ensure that those plants could stay in production. And I’m very proud to say that Kansas is one of the few, if not the only state, that did not have to actually shut down our packing plants.
Donald Trump : (22:32)
That’s right.
Laura Kelly: (22:32)
We were able to create an environment that was safe. And we’re also able to provide, with your assistance, our own agency’s non-congregate living. Because, a lot of the folks who work in these meat packing plants live with a lot of other people. And so we were able to work with our community colleges and our hotels in that area to provide a quarantine space for folks. And that’s worked out really well.
Donald Trump : (23:01)
And our people worked very well together. I have to say your representatives and my representatives really worked well together. They did a good job together.
Laura Kelly: (23:10)
I want to give a little shout out to the Senator Pat Roberts.
Donald Trump : (23:12)
Absolutely.
Laura Kelly: (23:13)
Who I think was instrumental in elevating our cry for help.
Donald Trump : (23:18)
Right. That’s true, that’s true. Thank you, very much. Good job.
Donald Trump : (23:23)
Asa, go ahead.
Asa Hutchinson: (23:25)
Thank you, Mr. President. Thanks for this opportunity to be here. I’ve enjoyed visiting with Dr. Birx, before. And Larry Kudlow about the economy, but also the health side of this. And I want to tell you, thank you for your leadership in the food production for our country. Arkansas has 60 meat processors here in the state of Arkansas. All of them are active, none of them are shut down. They’re producing because we know the country depends upon that production. But your support of that industry has been critical. And I also want to thank you for your leadership on the economy-
Asa Hutchinson: (24:02)
And I also want to thank you for your leadership on the economy. The message that you have, that we need to get back to work, get back to business is critical in terms of shaping the direction of our country. In Arkansas, we’re back to work today. All of our retail stores are open.
Donald Trump : (24:20)
Great.
Asa Hutchinson: (24:20)
All of our retail establishments totally are open. Our gyms are open. Our barbers are open. Our restaurants are open. Now, sure, they have some restrictions, one third occupancy and things like that.
Donald Trump : (24:32)
Right, sure.
Asa Hutchinson: (24:32)
And we’re emphasizing the social distancing, but we’re at work. And the result of that is that we were projecting a 10% loss of our sales tax revenue year, over year, 10% reduction. We’re getting the numbers in and we’re going to be at 5%. It’s going to be about 5%.
Donald Trump : (24:51)
That’s great. That’s big news.
Asa Hutchinson: (24:52)
And so obviously there’s a loss there we expected, but we’re beating all of those projections, including our payroll. And so we want to work and we really appreciate what you’ve done for small businesses in the payroll protection plan that our… We’ll be speaking about through the course of this meeting. And Lori [Trogden 00:25:16] is here. But also in terms of testing, just to give you a flavor of Arkansas, we have fewer than 100 hospitalized in Arkansas. We have right about 5,000 cases, all total cumulative.
Donald Trump : (25:30)
Right.
Asa Hutchinson: (25:30)
The active cases are much less than that, but we’ve ramped up our testing because last month you all said, “You can have 90,000 test kits.”
Donald Trump : (25:41)
Right.
Asa Hutchinson: (25:41)
Because of that, we were able to test this month, 2% of our population, which was our goal. We’re going to do 60,000 in May. And then we made a pledge that next month in June, we will test all of our nursing home residents and their workers. And so that’s our goal for June that will really help the safety of those in the nursing home, as well as the staff that’s there.
Asa Hutchinson: (26:05)
So while we’re growing the economy in Arkansas, it has to be a national effort because we’re not going to really boom in Arkansas until New York is strong again and until Kansas and all of our neighbors. And you mentioned the automobile industry. We’re in the supply chain. So we can’t really produce until they’re in operation. But we’ve got a lot of exciting things happening in the state, but it couldn’t have been done without the support and partnership that we have with your federal agencies that have been very responsive and given us what we needed.
Donald Trump : (26:40)
Thank you very much, Jason. You’ve done a great job. You both have done a really great job and it’s been an honor to work with both of you. Thank you very much. It was really terrific. Any questions please?
Speaker 7: (26:50)
Mr. President, what is it that you think is happening in Michigan that’s illegal?
Donald Trump : (26:55)
Well, I think if we’re talking about the mail in ballots, if people mail in ballots it’s a lot of illegality. They send in ballots that… They harvest ballots. You know all about harvesting and they do lots of bad things. Ideally people go out and they vote. Now, if you need a mail in ballot, if you need a specific… As an example, I’m in the White House and I have to send a ballot to Florida. That makes sense. So if you need it for some reason, or if somebody is not well, that’s one thing. But when you send out 7.7 million mail in ballots, there’s forgeries. There’s frankly, duplication, where they print ballots on the same kind of paper with the same kind of machinery. And you can’t tell the difference and they send in thousands and thousands of fake ballots. And I tell you what, this nation can’t be going down that path because it’s a very dangerous path to go down. Now, we just won a big election. You probably heard about this one in California. California 25, Mike Garcia, he just won a very big election and that was ballots.
Donald Trump : (27:58)
And it was a very… Sort of the opposite. They won the case for ballots. He was doing very well because their ballots… You see, he was way ahead in an area that frankly was not expected to go Republican. First time in 22 years that has happened. They flipped from Democrat to Republican in California. The first time in 22 years that had happened. And they actually put machines in there in the last three days, because they thought… meaning the Democrats… Because they thought that might happen, but it didn’t. But that was the case. That was a positive case. But mail in ballots are very dangerous. There’s tremendous fraud involved and tremendous illegality.
Speaker 7: (28:36)
But there are many Republicans, Secretaries of State, that are also moving to mail in ballots because of the pandemic and people are scared to go vote.
Donald Trump : (28:41)
Well, we’re going to see how it all works out, but they had 7.7 million applications sent out. They have, in the state of Nevada, they have a tremendous drive in where you just mail in your ballots. You can’t do that. You’ve got to go and vote. People have to check you. They have to see that it’s you. They’re supposed to look at you and check you and make sure that… I mean, when you get thousands of ballots and they put them in a bag and they just bring them in and stuff, people start counting, who knows where they come from? It’s so obvious. I mean, frankly, they should have voter ID. That’s what they should have. You really want to know what the country wants? The country wants voter ID. Otherwise it’s going to be subject to tremendous illegality and fraud.
Speaker 8: (29:27)
Mr. President, what funding are you considering withdrawing from Michigan?
Donald Trump : (29:28)
From?
Speaker 8: (29:33)
From Michigan. You threatened to keep funding away from the state of Michigan. Which funding were you referring to?
Donald Trump : (29:37)
Yeah, well, I have very specific funding. I just spoke with the governor. We didn’t discuss that. We really discussed more the topic at hand plus the dam’s breaking. So we didn’t… But we’ll let you know if it’s necessary. You’ll be finding out. They’ll be finding out very soon if it’s necessary. I don’t think it’s going to be necessary because mail in ballots are a very dangerous thing. They’re subject to massive fraud. And by the way, I don’t want to put anybody on the spot. If you have anything to say about it, or so Laura, but how, how can you do that? You know, people are signing ballots. Who knows who’s signing these ballots? They have a ballot. They pick the ballot. They take them out of mailboxes. They go around and accumulate them. They harvest, I guess the word is harvest them. And it was especially prevalent in California. And it’s just not a fair situation. Do you have any comments on that?
Asa Hutchinson: (30:29)
Well, I do. Of course, Arkansas supported a voter ID law.
Donald Trump : (30:33)
Good.
Asa Hutchinson: (30:33)
But in terms of the election in November, there’s a lot of discussion about how we can make the vote accessible if there is continued worry from a health standpoint. And we want to be able to use no excuse absentee voting as a way to do it. But it’s still a person to person identification of the individual-
Donald Trump : (30:58)
Right, sure.
Asa Hutchinson: (30:58)
Versus the mail in variety, that as you said, can be manipulated. So we’re looking at that, but we believe in the identification of the voter.
Donald Trump : (31:09)
I think just common sense would tell you that it’s massive manipulation can take place, massive. They… And you do, you have cases of fraudulent ballots where they actually print them and they give them to people to sign. Maybe the same person signs them with different writing, different pens. I don’t know. There’s, a lot of things can happen. Now, if you can, you should go and vote. Voting is an honor. It shouldn’t be something where they send you a pile of stuff and you send it back.
Donald Trump : (31:36)
Another thing that happens, a lot of people in certain districts, this is historically a lot of people in certain districts don’t ever get their ballot. They keep calling, “Where’s my vote? Where’s my ballot?” Then election day passes and they forget about it. And that can happen in the thousands. I’m not saying it does, but it can. It probably has.
Speaker 8: (31:58)
Just a follow up on that, sir. Are you concerned about the message that you’re sending of saying, you may withhold funding from Michigan when it’s also going through these issues with the Water and the dam breaking?
Donald Trump : (32:04)
No, I’m not. No, no. I’m not concerned at all. We’re going to help Michigan. Michigan is a great state. I’ve gotten tremendous business to go to Michigan. Michigan’s one of the reasons I ran. I was honored in Michigan long before I thought about… I was honored as the man of the year in Michigan at a big event. And I got up and I remember so well, I spoke probably five, six years before I even thought about running for president. And I got up and I spoke and I said, ” Why are you allowing them to steal your car business?” You know, we lost 32% of our car business to Mexico. And a lot of it came out of Michigan and I said, “Why did you allow that to happen?” And I posed many questions to Michigan that night. I think it made quite an impression. And now we have those same car factories, they’re coming back except in a brand newer and bigger form.
Donald Trump : (32:53)
So I think we’re going to do very well in Michigan. I guess we just got a poll. That’s very good right here. A very good poll about how we’re doing in Michigan and other swing states and just generally in the election, but I won’t show you. I’m sure you can get it. I won’t flip this over. Everyone is saying, “Could you flip it over?” But no, I think we’re doing very well in Michigan. Very great place and I’ll be there tomorrow. And… I guess it’s tomorrow… But I’ll be there tomorrow at the Ford plant and I’m maybe going to do the double stop or I’ll go back on the dams, but we have to take care of that problem.
Speaker 9: (33:28)
Mr. President, with 4% of the world’s population and 30% of the outbreak, what would you have done differently facing this crisis?
Donald Trump : (33:37)
Well, nothing. If you take New York and New Jersey, which were very hard hit, we were very, very low. And in terms of morbidity and in terms of… You look at the death, relatively speaking, we’re at the lowest level, along with Germany. And Germany, us, it could have been some smaller countries too, perhaps. I’d like to ask you maybe about that, if I could, Deborah. We’ve done, you know, amazingly well. I think the biggest thing we did is stopping the inflow from China into our country. And Deborah was a big supporter of that. I mean, in terms of how important it turned out to be. And so was Tony Fauci. They were very, very… Tony said we saved thousands and thousands of lives. That was a great decision that was made. And that was made very early, please, Deborah.
Dr. Birx: (34:26)
Yeah, I think it’s always confusing and particularly confusing to the American people when we don’t emphasize the size of our country. We’re the third largest country in the world, but every country has its different experience with this virus. And so you have to adjust everything to population size. And so when you look at Spain and Italy, our attack rates to this virus are identical to other countries that have experienced the type of epidemic that we have experienced. And so every country is different. That’s why you really need to always report data normalized for population. And then you look at the mortality by population. And it’s true. We have, compared to our European colleagues, some of the lowest mortality, about half of Italy and Spain. And so I think it’s really important that… And then these two states represent what we’ve been asking states to do. In Kansas, they found 50% of their clusters were in specific meatpacking, nursing homes.
Donald Trump : (35:24)
Good job.
Dr. Birx: (35:24)
They identified their clusters. They found their clusters. They took care of those clusters. And that was 50% of all of their cases. In Arkansas, 80% of their, of the Arkansas individuals have recovered with less than a 2% mortality. And so these are the… It’s really important. We’re a big country, but each state is different, but as a country, we’re different than other countries around the world. We’ll be asking questions later about why were certain countries completely spared? And I think that’s always a question that we have. Epidemiology is like that. But if your country has never had significant infections, you can’t compare it to a global number that-
Dr. Birx: (36:03)
Has never had significant infections, you can’t compare it to a global number. There’s multiple countries in Africa where there’s really almost no outbreak, and then South Africa has a very different outbreak. So each of these outbreaks are different and that’s why it has to be really granular to understand it, and to respond to it. And you can see these two states have done exactly what we asked them to do. Find cases, contact trace, contain outbreaks, and ensure that their citizens do as well as possible. And that’s what these states illustrate.
Donald Trump : (36:33)
And just to finish your question, though, I mean, so we’re in that category along with Germany as the lowest. And I think that’s a great honor. And that’s including New York and New Jersey, which have had a very… They had a very high number. So if you include New York, New Jersey, do everything. If you don’t include New York and New Jersey, we’re just about in a class by ourselves. Now with-
Reporter: (36:58)
What about China?
Donald Trump : (36:59)
Well, China, you tell me about it? You think they are right numbers? Do you think China’s giving the right number? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. Take a look at the numbers. They gave numbers that were so low. I mean, I saw more problem on television than they were reporting just by looking at a picture. So I’m not including China in any numbers because those numbers weren’t correct, obviously. And that’s been easily shown and easily proven. But, no, our people have done a fantastic job. Deborah, I always talk about the fact that our testing is so far advanced that we’re close to 14 million in testing. 14 million. And would you say China is at… Not China. If you would say Germany would be at maybe three or four-
Dr. Birx: (37:43)
Yes, as far as I can tell. I can tell you [crosstalk 00:37:45].
Donald Trump : (37:45)
Three? And South Korea is at a number. You tell us what that number is.
Dr. Birx: (37:50)
Well, we’ve been way ahead of South Korea for a long time.
Donald Trump : (37:53)
Way ahead of everybody.
Dr. Birx: (37:54)
Germany has done three million tests; Italy, three million tests; UK, about 2.7 million; Spain, three million. And I think to us, it’s not just the number of tests. It’s how those tests are utilized. And I think in both of these states, you can see they focus testing where they knew the outbreaks were. And now they’re proactively testing in nursing homes where they think the outbreaks could go next and finding the asymptomatic cases. I think we’ve only learned in the last couple of months how many asymptomatic cases there are. And I think a lot of people at the beginning wanted to approach this like flu, and most of the people who get flu are symptomatic. So really, I think our thoughts have evolved, our understanding has evolved, and the states have evolved with us, really working in partnership to really change how we look for cases. And I think that’s really remarkable.
Dr. Birx: (38:49)
We’re not waiting for people to get sick to find cases now. And what you’re doing with testing and what you’re doing with testing in a proactive way is the way we’re moving as a country. And because we can do nearly 14 million tests, we have the luxury to be able to be proactive in our testing now.
Donald Trump : (39:05)
But when you do 14 million tests, you’re going to find more cases. If instead of 14 million tests, we did three million, like Germany’s at about three million, South Korea’s at three million, and they’ve done a very good job. It’s not a knock, but we’re at almost 14 million. We’re going to be passing 14 million very soon. So you’re going to have more tests. If we did three million, everyone would say, “Oh, we’re doing great,” in terms of cases. We’re going to have more cases. If we did three million, maybe that’s what we should have done. If I would have done three million, they’d have said, “Oh, they have very few cases. United States is doing well.” We’re finding a lot of people. By doing testing, you’re finding people. So we’re doing 14, Germany’s doing three, South Korea’s doing three, and I think they’re number two and three. So we’re way ahead of everybody. But when you do that, you have more cases.
Donald Trump : (39:53)
So a lot of times the fake news media will say, “There are a lot of cases in the United States.” Well, if we didn’t do testing at a level that nobody’s ever dreamt possible, you wouldn’t have very many cases. So we’re finding a lot of cases, and we’re doing a great job once we find them. Okay, thank you very much.
Press: (40:13)
[crosstalk 00:40:14].
Donald Trump : (40:13)
Thank you.
Speaker 10: (40:13)
Come on, guys. Press, let’s go. Thank you.
Reporter: (40:20)
[inaudible 00:40:20] follow up. How do we compare on a per capita basis? Obviously, the United States is much larger than a lot of these European countries. How does our testing compare per capita?
Donald Trump : (40:26)
Sure. You want to do that, Deborah. Per capita?
Dr. Birx: (40:29)
Yeah, our testing now, we’re almost up to four percent. So some of the European countries are at four to five percent. And I think our goal is to ensure that we can find the asymptomatics. And I think that’s really our focus right now, working with every state to really help them identify where these clusters came from historically, and then proactively going for those clusters, identifying them early, and finding the asymptomatic individuals before… And no one’s intending to spread the virus. I always want to be very clear about that. Asymptomatic people don’t know they’re infected, and so together we’re really working to find them. And I think it’s a unique challenge. And I think together, we’re really making progress.
Donald Trump : (41:14)
And when you see a per capita, there’s many per capitas. It’s like per capita relative to what? But you could look at just about any category, and we’re really at the top, meaning positive on a per capita basis, too. They’ve done a great job. Please, Caitlyn?
Caitlyn: (41:29)
I heard yesterday at the Republican lunch that you were complaining about the CDC and the delayed roll out of testing. Do you think-
Donald Trump : (41:37)
No, I wasn’t… I don’t know who gave you that. It’s fake news.
Caitlyn: (41:38)
Do you think Robert Redfield is doing a good job leading the CDC?
Donald Trump : (41:40)
Yeah, I do. I do. It’s fake news, Caitlyn, fake news. Therefore, you can report it on CNN.
Caitlyn: (41:47)
You didn’t complain?
Donald Trump : (41:47)
It’s perfect for CNN.
Caitlyn: (41:48)
You didn’t complain about the CDC?
Donald Trump : (41:50)
No, no.
Caitlyn: (41:50)
Do you think they did a good job with testing at the beginning?
Donald Trump : (41:54)
Well, you’re asking me a wise guy question. At the beginning, and again, I didn’t put CDC there. CDC has been there long before the Trump administration came in. But they had a test that was… Something happened to it. It was soiled. It was soiled and/or foiled, but it was a problem, a short term problem. It lasted for about a week. And then they got that solved. And frankly, the end result is… And this was done outside of CDC. This was done by private companies and people that we got involved. And you look at the numbers, I know you don’t like to talk about the numbers of what we’ve done, but for the first week, they had a problem, CDC, because something went wrong with one of the tests and that can happen. I’m not blaming CDC for it.
Donald Trump : (42:40)
No, I think he’s done a very good job. I think that my whole team has done a very good job. And it’s not really… If they were there… CDC has been there for a long time. There’s some great talent in CDC. I deal with them. So now what you’re saying is, okay, we’ve done 14 million tests. So we can’t hit the President on that. So let’s go back to the first week. The CDC has done, I think, a really good job.
Donald Trump : (43:04)
No, and I didn’t say anything bad about CDC at the meeting. We actually had a very good meeting. The Republican party, the senators, I think virtually everyone was there. We had 53 there, and we had a great meeting. We’re looking to do great things for the country. We’re helping people with stimulus. We’re getting money to people. They need it. And we’re going to open up very big. We’re going to open up. I call it Transition to Greatness. That’s what it is. It’s a transition to greatness. And when Larry Kudlow tells you the numbers, those are really surprisingly good numbers this early in. I mean, we’re doing very well. I think it’s going to be something special.
Donald Trump : (43:42)
These are two governors that we invited. They’ve both done a fantastic job. One happens to be a Democrat, one happens to be a Republican. But I think I’ve worked at… You’ve been on most of those calls, Laura, I think we can say the Democrats have been as nice about what we’ve done as the Republicans. I mean, it’s been terrific. And Laura, I know she will speak her mind and so will some of the others. And if she was unhappy, she’d be letting you know. No, we’ve done a really great job. We’ve gotten along great with Democrats, the Democratic governors, and we’ve gotten along great with the Republicans. It’s been a tremendous thing to witness, and we’re doing a fantastic job with… And you have been fantastic, Deborah, I have to say. You’ve been working 24 hours a day, and I hope people appreciate what you’re doing, but I do. I do. Thank you very much.

Everything good? Farmers doing good?
Speaker 1: (00:02)
[inaudible 00:00:03].
Donald Trump: (00:03)
Thank you, President Trump. We do, thank you very much, all, appreciate it. We’re here this morning to announce dramatic action to support our nation’s farmers, ranchers and growers as we work to safely reopen America and it’s happening very fast. Much faster, and with much better numbers than anybody would have thought. I want to begin by expressing our profound gratitude to everyone here today and the farmers and producers across the country, who have kept our nation fed and nourished as we have battled the invisible enemy. It is an invisible enemy. It’s tough, but we’re going to win and we’re going to win very big.
Donald Trump: (00:42)
But we can never forget all of the people that have been left behind, that have died. For some reason that should’ve never happened, should have never happened. You know that, I know that, and the people that caused the problem, they know that too. It’s too bad. You remind us once again that the American farmers, the backbone of our country, and they’re really a great friend of mine and I appreciate all the support, and I know they appreciate our support. We’re glad to be joined by Secretary Sonny Perdue, along with Ivanka, who has been working closely with Sonny to deliver this vital assistance for farmers and needy families.
Donald Trump: (01:21)
I’m also grateful to the president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, Zippy Duvall. Thank you very much. Thank you and thank you, Zippy, thank you. The president of the National Cattleman’s Beef Association, Marty Smith. Marty, thank you, Marty. And several of our great agricultural producers, nice to meet all of you. It’s really good to meet you. Zippy, you’re doing okay?
Zippy Duvall: (01:48)
I’m doing great.
Donald Trump: (01:48)
You got my condolences I hope, right?
Zippy Duvall: (01:50)
Yes, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:51)
Okay. Zippy was married to a great woman. And for purposes of the record, you still are, you always will be, right? She was a great person.
Zippy Duvall: (02:01)
[inaudible 00:02:01].
Donald Trump: (02:02)
Yeah, no. She was a great person. From day one, my administration has been determined to protect our nation’s incredible farmers. We enacted historic tax cuts and helped the family farms stay in the family. What we did is we passed, as you know in the tax cuts, the death tax, the inheritance tax, small farms and ranchers and even businesses, you don’t have to pay it, it’s a big deal. Instead of losing your farm, you keep your farm. I think that was a big deal, what do you think?
Speaker 2: (02:33)
[inaudible 00:02:34].
Donald Trump: (02:33)
Maybe your farm is so big it doesn’t qualify.
Speaker 2: (02:36)
No, I wish it was.
Donald Trump: (02:38)
No, but we eliminated that horrible death tax. And most of the kids, many of the kids lost the farm, they go borrow to pay the tax and then they ended up losing the farms, right? You don’t have to pay that tax anymore. I think that’s one of the reasons that farmers like me, I guess, but hopefully that’s not the only reason. We eliminated crushing Washington regulations, kept our promise on ethanol and replaced and negotiated a badly broken trade deals to finally give you a fair and level playing field. When China unfairly targeted our farmers, we provided $28 million in direct assistance. And it came from China, not from our government and you know that happened and they paid for it, we didn’t pay. They have this misconception, they like to say this as much as possible. China devalued their currency in order to pay it. We didn’t pay it. And what we did is we helped. I went to Sonny, we had $12 billion two years ago. We had $16 billion last year. And this year you’ll be hearing about what we’re doing because it’s very substantial. And through the Paycheck Protection Program, we have approved billions of dollars in relief to farmers as part of our unprecedented coronavirus relief efforts. So the paycheck has been a fantastic success as you know. Now we’re standing strong with our farmers and ranchers once again. In normal times, roughly 40% of fresh vegetables and about 40% of beef grown and raised in the United States is distributed to restaurants and other commercial food establishments. But as you know, the virus has forced many of our nation’s restaurants to temporarily close. And this has taken a major toll on our farmers and growers. Some of whom were dealing directly with restaurants. I didn’t realize that until yesterday, we were with the big restaurants and said they sometimes will deal directly with your farmer, no middlemen, no nothing, just directly and it’s a big business.
Donald Trump: (04:35)
For this reason my administration is launching a sweeping new initiative, the coronavirus food assistance program. Through this effort, we are providing $19 billion to support our nation’s agricultural producers, maintain the health of our critical food supply chains and provide food assistance to American families, $19 billion. No other president’s done this, Zippy. I tell you, you could go back to Abraham Lincoln, there’s no president that’s treated the farmers like Trump. No, no, no. I hear we’re doing well with the farmers, but I can’t imagine … I want to find out who wouldn’t be, who wouldn’t be with Trump, right? But it’s an honor to do it, actually. It’s an honor, they’re great people. These are great, great people. As part of this program today, we’re announcing $16 billion direct payments to farmers and ranchers. So $16 billion is going directly to the farmers and ranchers.
Donald Trump: (05:32)
And it’s authorized by the Cares Act and the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act. We fought hard for this. These payments will compensate farmers for losses related to the global pandemic, caused by China. We’ll be providing billions of dollars for corn, cotton, soybean and specialty crop farmers, cattle ranchers, just about every category. I think we have almost every category and if we don’t, we’re going to add them, all right. If we left something out, but we have a lot of territory, dairy producers, pork producers, and more. I read yesterday where we take some cattle in from other countries because we have trade deals. I think you should look at terminating those deals, all right?
Donald Trump: (06:18)
We have trade deals where we actually take in cattle and we have a lot of cattle in this country. And I think you should look at the possibility of terminating those trade deals. Now, if a country has been a great country and a great ally and a great friend, you have to do that. But there are some countries that are sending us cattle for many years. And I think we should look at terminating. We’re very self sufficient and we’re becoming more and more self sufficient. Probably one of the reasons I got elected. Sign ups will begin on May 26 through your local farm service agency offices. They got to go sign up to pick it up, to get the money. And we’ll start issuing payments within one week of receiving your application. So that’s a lot of money, you’re talking about a total of $16 billion plus three billion.
Donald Trump: (07:11)
We bought last week and it’s already in distribution, three billion dollars worth of product for the food lines. Is this already in distribution? I see that they’re handing it out. I see where they couldn’t get food, they’re having a hard time. And we have these incredible ranchers and farmers that have so much food. And I said, let’s spend that money and give it to our farmers, our ranchers and it’s worked out really well. And they’ve already got it in supply, it’s already on the lines. I saw them handing it out today, a couple of days ago, actually, it’s fantastic how quickly it works. In addition, this important initiative also includes a new Farmers to Families Food Box program, which Ivanka and Secretary Perdue helped officially launch on Friday.
Donald Trump: (07:57)
Through this effort, the Department of Agriculture will work with local food distribution companies and we have a lot of great distribution companies, I’ve gotten to meet some of them. Which have also been hit very hard to purchase three billion dollars of food and produce from the American farmer, which I just mentioned, and to deliver to the food banks and charities that serve needy families. Already, we’ve allocated one point two billion dollars to Farmers to Families, funding through 198 contracts with distribution companies. Many of which are small businesses adversely impacted also by this horrible plague. It’s a plague. Here today are a few of the American farmers and ranchers who can tell us why this program has been so essential and successful. Scott Sink is a cattle producer, his business has been badly impacted by the virus. He says this initiative will provide a bridge to help them move forward. And we’ve been helping them in a lot of other ways too, but this was a great help. And Scott, please come forward. Thank you, Scott.
Donald Trump: (09:01)
Thank you, Scott. Thank you very much.
Scott Sink: (09:06)
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Scott Sink: (09:08)
Hi, my name is Scott Sink. I’m a producer in southwest Virginia, Blacksburg. We have a catering business and we do farm to table along with raising livestock, produce and custom hay. We were able to benefit from the Paycheck Protection Program and now this bridge will also help us get into the new growing season.
Scott Sink: (09:27)
Talking to farmers all across the country, farming is something that’s always unexpected. We deal with that. We have to pivot at any time, but with something like this, that’s impacted the supply chain, producers as well as consumers, that’s why having a program like this is very beneficial to all of us.
Scott Sink: (09:43)
So we thank y’all.
Donald Trump: (09:44)
Thank you very much and you love that business. You wouldn’t trade businesses for anything, right?
Scott Sink: (09:51)
No sir.
Donald Trump: (09:51)
What is it with farmers? They don’t want to do anything else. They have some bad years but we’ve helped them have very good years actually. But they have some bad years but they wouldn’t trade it for anything would they?
Scott Sink: (10:00)
Always [inaudible 00:01:02].
Donald Trump: (10:03)
That’s true and then they start making money and they go out and buy bigger tractors. Maybe they’ll slow it up a little bit the next time. Right. But you guys are great.
Donald Trump: (10:12)
Robert Mills raises both crops and livestock and he believes this program will help countless farm families get buy and more than by, as we begin to reopen our economy and it’s opening up really fast. Robert, please come up. Robert. Thank you.
Robert Mills Jr.: (10:26)
Thank you, Mr. President. I’m Robert Mills Jr. I’m a first generation farmer from Southside of Virginia. We raised tobacco, beef cattle, poultry, hay, small grain and industrial hemp for CBD. We’re pretty diverse operation and we are diverse because we always expect the unexpected and we want to make sure that we can stay in business and we didn’t expect this. But I will tell the American people that your farmers and your ranchers were out here working each and every day to make sure that those grocery store shelves, stay full and it’s administrations like President Trump’s administration and the forethought that he’s had with the programs that’s been put in place and the one that we’re talking about today. It’s not a rescue program. It’s going to help these farm families be able to make good, wise financial decisions, in the months and weeks and years ahead and it’s also there to let them know that this country is there supporting them because this country relies on what these farmers and ranchers do every day.
Robert Mills Jr.: (11:29)
So I want to personally thank President Trump, the administration, and all those who’ve worked hard to make sure that these farm families stay there, that they stay whole and that the American people will never have to worry about running out of food. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (11:43)
Thank you very much. I love his accent. I love that accent. Is that originally from Virginia?
Robert Mills Jr.: (11:50)
Yes, sir. Southside, Virginia, about 20 miles north of North Carolina.
Donald Trump: (11:53)
Oh, I see and they like Trump.
Robert Mills Jr.: (11:54)
Yes, they do.
Donald Trump: (11:55)
They like Trump. That’s that’s great area. Thank you very much. Great job. You know, the farmers were targeted by China when we started negotiating tough with China and what I did is we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars of tariffs. Sonny was very aware of this because he had to distribute the money to the farmers. I said, “Sonny, we’ve taken in a lot of money. How much did the farmers lose?” This is two years ago.
Donald Trump: (12:24)
They were targeted for an amount. What do you think? The impact? He said, “$12 billion.” So I said, “That’s okay. We’ll take $12 billion out of our tariff money,” which was many billions, more than that, that China paid. Never paid us 25 cents, by the way. Before that, before Trump, they never paid anything. I said, “We’ll take 12 billion out of the tens of billions of dollars that we took in and we’re going to give it to the farmers.” And you distributed that money and Zippy, I think you were shocked because you’ve never seen anything.
Donald Trump: (12:51)
Otherwise these farmers wouldn’t have been in business. So we took 12 million. We gave it to the farmers. We said, “Thank you very much to China. Thank you very much, China,” and then the next year I said, “Sonny, what’s the number?” We called Zippy. We called some of the other people. We determined it was $16 billion that the farmers were targeted; 16 billion by China.
Donald Trump: (13:11)
So I took 16 billion out of the tariffs, which were many, many billions of tens of billions more than that. We gave it to the farmers, right? This year the same thing. It’s been pretty amazing and the farmers are doing fine. One of them said, “I do better this way.” But you know what? They don’t want to do better that way. They just want a level playing field but we took care of our farmers. Right? And ranchers. Thank you, Robert. That was great. Appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (13:38)
David Hickman is a vegetable grower who runs Dublin Farms in Virginia. His potatoes will be among the produce distributed to local food banks through The Farmers To Families Program and David, please come up and say a few words.
Donald Trump: (13:53)
Hi, David.
David Hickman: (13:56)
Thank you, Mr. President. I’m David Hickman with Dublin Farms in Horntown, Virginia. We are a fifth generation operation, produce fresh market potatoes, red skins, yellows, whites.
David Hickman: (14:13)
This program is going to help tremendously with the movement of potatoes this summer. For us, we have six distributors who are our current customers that are doing the food box program. So our potatoes will be in some of these food boxes. We’ve submitted bids for a five pound bags to go directly to the food banks of yellow and white potatoes. So certainly going to impact the Virginia potato business.
Donald Trump: (14:40)
See a five pound bags, what other size bags do you have?
David Hickman: (14:43)
We have a packing operation. We pack five pound bags, 10 pound bags, 50 pound bags, and then 2,000 pound bags that go to other packers but a lot of our business goes into the terminal markets also. That’s dependent on restaurant business. So we’re anxious to see our restaurants get back up.
David Hickman: (15:06)
Certain sizes of potatoes are used primarily for food service, so it’s important.
Donald Trump: (15:11)
So is potato a big business in Virginia.
David Hickman: (15:13)
It’s regionally, it’s a big business and our area called the Eastern Shore.
Donald Trump: (15:18)
How does that area compare with Idaho?
David Hickman: (15:21)
Oh, we’re very, very, very small compared to the Idaho production but we fit a niche between farther North Carolina’s spring production.
Donald Trump: (15:32)
Is it a very similar product, would you say? Or is it different?
David Hickman: (15:33)
No. The Idaho potatoes are like the russet long potato. We grow red skin potatoes and round yellow potatoes.
Donald Trump: (15:41)
Could you grow an Idaho?
David Hickman: (15:43)
We do but we fill a different market.
Donald Trump: (15:46)
That’s very good.
David Hickman: (15:47)
Our potatoes-
Donald Trump: (15:47)
Just interesting to me.
David Hickman: (15:52)
Our potatoes are shipped right from the field to the store.
Donald Trump: (15:55)
That’s great.
David Hickman: (15:55)
Where Idaho, they store them through the winter and we also grow green beans for fresh market, which is largely dependent on restaurant business. Also grow corn, soy beans.
Donald Trump: (16:07)
You love that business.
David Hickman: (16:08)
Done it all my life. Yes, sir. On my home farm, there’s been potatoes planting there since 1887, which is sort of unusual in the country. All different parts of that field, farm, has being in potatoes.
Donald Trump: (16:22)
Beautiful business. Beautiful way to live.
David Hickman: (16:24)
We appreciate what you’re doing for us.
Donald Trump: (16:25)
Thank you very much.
David Hickman: (16:26)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (16:27)
Great job. Gave me a little education but that’s interesting. I wonder if the media enjoyed that? I don’t think so but that’s okay. I might. Be careful. I might. I’ll be there. We’re going after Virginia with your crazy governor. We’re going after Virginia.
Donald Trump: (16:46)
They want to take your second amendment away. You know that, right? You’ll have nobody guarding your potatoes.
Donald Trump: (16:51)
As each of you demonstrate a healthy economy is vital to maintaining a healthy society and by working together, we can restore our economy, shield the vulnerable, care for the needy, deliver world class healthcare and vanquish the virus.
Donald Trump: (17:05)
I have to say, the job you do is so powerful and so important. The American farmer is very critical to the success of that mission and what I’d like to do is just before I finish, I’d like to ask Zippy to come up and say a couple of words, because he really is at the forefront of so much of what we do.
Donald Trump: (17:23)
So Zippy Duvall, come on up.
Zippy Duvall: (17:25)
Thank you, Mr.. President. I remember four years and several months ago, I won the election to be President of American Farm Bureau and candidate Trump called me. He says, “I’m going to be a friend to the farmer.” And Mr. President, I’m here to tell you today, thank you. You’ve lived up to those words that you made to me that day.
Zippy Duvall: (17:49)
I represent all farmers across the country. I also farm. My son and I. I’m third generation. My son is fourth generation. We run a 400 cow, beef cattle operation and we grow chickens for Pilgrim Pride, about a million and a half chickens a year.
Zippy Duvall: (18:03)
We grow chickens for Pilgrim Prime, about a million and a half chickens a year. And the farmers across America are very appreciative, mister president, of what you’ve done. You’ve stood behind us during a trade war. You stood behind us during all the difficulties we went through. And now with the pandemic, you stood behind us again. And you know, and you’ve made the comment, we’re the only group that comes to the White House without our hand … We don’t come with our hands out.
Donald Trump: (18:26)
That’s true. That’s true.
Zippy Duvall: (18:26)
We want that level playing field. We want that trade. We want to be able to make our money from the markets. But we appreciate when we’re going through difficult times that you stand behind us. This pandemic has made us realize one thing. We live in land of plenty, but there’s a food chain that is just as important to us as our military is. We have to be able to feed our own people. We can’t afford to be fed by other countries, that makes us a national security issue. And we know that you realize that. And I think the American people unfortunately have had go to the store and see some empty shelves. And we all now realize how important that chain, that food chain is. And the farmer is that very first link.
Zippy Duvall: (19:13)
Without that support, we wouldn’t be there to produce that food. Our farmers are still farming. Hashtag still farming. You’ll get some great stories. We’ve touched over 50 million people with that hashtag, talking about what farmers are doing, still farming, but we want to thank you. We want to thank Secretary Purdue for his hard work, and his staff’s done an excellent job putting this problem together, and we want to thank Congress for thinking about agriculture today and delivering it to your desk for you to sign. So many thanks for helping the people that feed the American people. And we look forward to continuing to work with you, Mr. Trump, we appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (19:54)
Thank you very much. Thanks Zippy. That’s true. Four and a half years ago, I called Zippy, never spoke to him and he liked me. I liked him and I don’t know, I got good support right from the beginning, but we’ve come through.
Zippy Duvall: (20:06)
[inaudible 00:20:06] my wife.
Donald Trump: (20:06)
We’ve come through. Absolutely. She’s a great woman. Great woman. Thank you very much Zippy. So just to conclude, American farmers, ranchers, and growers feed fuel and sustain our nation. They’re proud defenders of the American way of life, and I’m proud to stand right by their side in this hour of need. And the food chains are now back to almost working perfectly again. They had some interruptions which you knew about, and we were able to take a very bold action, you saw that. And that action caused them to do what they had to do. And they were in good shape, and very shortly there’ll be an absolutely perfect shape, but people were worried about that. The action we took was a very important action, Larry Kudlow, wasn’t it? We did a good job. Now I’d like to ask Secretary Perdue to say a few words followed by Ivanka and Marty Smith, if I could. Okay? Please, please.
Secretary Perdue: (21:02)
Mister president. I remember very clearly you calling me just a few weeks ago when you read about the effects of the pandemic own American agriculture. And once again you directed me, Sonny, we’re going to have to help our farmers. Bring me a program. What’s it going to take? I want you to use all the available resources at your disposal, just as you’ve done before, when China retaliated against our farmers there. I don’t know how, mister president, but you instinctively know that American agriculture, farmers and ranchers have been the bedrock of our American economy since the founding of our nation and still are. And we talked about the food supply chain, you know that instinctively, but I want to tell you, I’ve never, in my lifetime, seen another president recognized that value among the folks standing here and representing farmers and ranchers all across the country.
Secretary Perdue: (21:54)
So we’re very appreciative at USDA that we don’t have to push the rock up the hill. Usually when it comes to President Trump, the rock’s coming down the hill, I have to catch it. And we appreciate that very much that we don’t have to sell you on the value of agriculture, but the program that we’re announcing today will be a benefit. The $16 million of direct farmer, direct payments to farmers of all sizes and really all production there will be very helpful. A real lifeline, but certainly the program that Ivanka and I were privileged to go out last Friday, the coastal produce that you see here is also a lifeline, not only to those specialty crop producers, both dairy producers and meat producers, but also to the families who need this food.
Secretary Perdue: (22:40)
So you can see this is high quality food here that is being distributed all across the country to our food banks, and really a lifeline for them as well. So the food supply chain begins with these producers representing farmers and branches all across the country, ending up in the families tables that need this food is a real noble profession. I’m honored to be a part of it. And I’m really particularly honored, President Trump, that you understand, just in your heart, how valuable our American agricultural sector is. And I thank you.
Donald Trump: (23:10)
Thank you.
Ivanka Trump: (23:15)
Thank you, secretary. This is an incredibly exciting day as this very large relief package is announced. And you can hear today and you can hear through the course of the campaign in the last three years, the special place all of you have in the heart of this president. Farmers and ranchers feed America. And that’s never been more true than we’ve all realized over the course of the last several months. In addition to the much needed relief, the $16 billion that will go to farmers and ranchers to help support them through this difficult time. This farmers to family food box program is just an amazing initiative. As the secretary mentioned, the saw that there were those in need, those vulnerable. Long lines at food banks trying to get food. And yet there was this unbelievable, beautiful American fresh produce that was going to waste.
Ivanka Trump: (24:09)
So thinking about that supply chain and ensuring with $3 billion, that those who are vulnerable, that those who are in need get access to boxes like these 20 to 25 pounds of meat, milk, all forms of dairy, and of course, great fresh produce is incredibly virtuous. It’s a great cycle. It helps the small distributors. It helps the small farmers who weren’t prioritized in the bids. And of course it helps those in need. So we’re very excited about this program. These boxes themselves will also be going to a mission here in DC, along with several others that we have at the White House. And we hope that these boxes will play a big role in feeding those who needed across the country. So thank you. And thank you secretary for the hard work of your team in standing up this program so rapidly. We think that it will be extraordinarily successful for our small farmers and, of course, those in need, so thank you.
Donald Trump: (25:06)
Thank you. Marty?
Marty Smith: (25:15)
Thank you, mister president. You have provided unprecedented leadership to the United States and to the world throughout this crisis. And with that, you have shown so much concern and so much support for American agriculture, and on behalf of the National Cattleman’s Beef Association and the rest of agriculture, I want to say thank you. I’m Marty Smith. And I’m a rancher from Florida and serving this year as president of the National Cattleman’s Beef Association. Your executive order a few weeks ago directed toward the packers. We’re starting to see the impact of that. We’re getting beef pork back online and getting the products back on the shelf. America’s farmers and ranchers continue to work around the clock to feed the public, to feed all of our notion, feed a large part of the world. What you’ve done with that and what we’re doing with this current program enables us to stay in business and continue to do that.
Marty Smith: (26:14)
Again, we thank you for that. We thank your administration. Working with Secretary Perdue has just been a great way for us to all move forward. Even more importantly than that, I want to thank you and your family. With us, it’s all about our families and our family operation. Your family is just as dedicated to this, and Ivanka, we thank you for the support. You’ve shown them to us. It’s just … It’s so meaningful. And together we get through this and we do beat this and we keep the highest quality, safest, most sustainable protein sources on the plate of Americans all through this. And we thank you.
Donald Trump: (26:52)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, any questions real quick?
Speaker 3: (26:55)
Mister president-
Donald Trump: (26:59)
I’m going to Capitol Hill [inaudible 00:26:58].
Speaker 4: (27:02)
Mister president, will any of this aid-
Speaker 5: (27:03)
Will any of this aid be directed towards cattlemen, chicken farmers and pork producers who have had to euthanize their flocks already because of the pandemic?
Donald Trump: (27:13)
Do you want to answer that question, sir?
Speaker 6: (27:17)
Yes, we’re gathering that data now. This particular direct payment is not directly for that. There will be help coming through NRCS over the euthanasia and disposal coming that way. So there will be certainly directed there soon.
Speaker 5: (27:34)
Do you know when we can expect some of that guidance?
Speaker 6: (27:34)
Yeah, it will be after this is announced and we get more data. There are a lot of rumors out there about what’s actually happening. We want to get the facts and the data and make policy based on good data.
Donald Trump: (27:46)
And that’s being looked at separately.
Speaker 7: (27:49)
Mr. President, how is your administration addressing the comorbidities that Secretary Azar said are responsible for a lot of the coronavirus deaths: Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, obviously very closely connected to our food supply.
Donald Trump: (28:02)
Well, I think we just want people in this country to be healthy. How does every country address it? We want our people to be healthy. We want them to be happy and we want them to have all of the benefits that you could have including great healthcare. The Republican party has been very strong on healthcare, as you know, and that includes preexisting conditions. And we have done a terrific job on healthcare. Then we got hit by a plague like nobody’s ever seen before, outside of maybe 1917. And I think we’ve done an incredible job in producing ventilators and producing testing. Right now, you probably saw the numbers were over 12 million tests. That’s three times more, four times more than any other country in the world. And we’re talking about countries that have done a good job. Nobody’s done testing like us. Plus we have the highest quality test. So very simply we want our people to be healthy. [crosstalk 00:28:53]
Speaker 7: (28:53)
But the diabetes, hypertension, and obesity specifically, that’s very closely connected to the food supply. How are you addressing those? Specifically, your own health and human services secretary said that’s why America has so many COVID deaths.
Donald Trump: (29:03)
Sure, we want to give people great food. And that’s one of the reasons we have our farmers and ranchers involved.
Speaker 8: (29:08)
Could you talk a little bit more about this problem. You say it’s a problem with importing cattle from other countries. What is the problem there?
Donald Trump: (29:14)
Well, it’s a relatively small number. Actually, I heard Sonny speaking about it yesterday. It’s a very small number, but it’s still cattle coming in. We have tremendous amounts of supply cattle and all, but generally speaking, supply. Tremendous supply, our farmers have done an incredible job. And now the distribution is being made much better than it has been and better. I think it will end up being much better than it’s ever been, [Zippy. 00:00:29:38].
Donald Trump: (29:38)
But I’m saying, why are we bringing in cattle? All trade deals that were made a long time ago, why are we bringing in cattle from other countries when we have so much ourselves? Now, in some cases, I thought your answer was very good. They’ve been great allies. They’ve been working with us for many years. Sometimes we needed the cattle and sometimes we don’t. That’s the farming business, but I would say generally speaking, unless this is a country that really has been with us, we shouldn’t be taking their cattle. You know that. Okay? And that’s the way we’re going to handle it.
Speaker 8: (30:06)
On a separate subject, you sent a letter last night to the WHO. What reforms do they need to do to understand [crosstalk 00:30:13].
Donald Trump: (30:14)
I don’t want to go through it. The letter is a very detailed, long letter. But basically they have to clean up their act. They have to do a better job. They have to be much more fair to other countries, including the United States. So we’re not going to be involved with them anymore. We’ll do in a separate way. Okay? [crosstalk 00:30:29]
Speaker 9: (30:33)
Some workers at meat packing plants, it’s like they’re still concerned about their safety and that they want the government to do more to enforce and make sure that meat packing companies are keeping their workers safe with protective equipment, testing, et cetera. Is there any more that you plan to do to make sure and enforce that meat packing companies are keeping their workers safe?
Donald Trump: (30:57)
I’ve been very much involved with plants since this problem came up and they’ve done a lot in terms of shields and other things, but they had a disproportionately high number of people that had the problem and that’s going away. The plants are very, very clean now. And they’re getting to a level where I think we had a report that they’re cleaner than they’ve ever been. That’s a good report, but I don’t know exactly what that means, but they are cleaner than they’ve ever been. They’re doing a very good job, I think, right now in terms of the Production Act and in terms of what we’re enforcing. But the meat packing plants are coming online. Many of them are online and fewer and fewer problems and being seen. If we didn’t act, we would have had a big problem. If somebody who was in this position, that didn’t act, we would have had a big problem, but it’s something that we were very much involved in because we saw it very early. Okay. Did you have a question?
Speaker 10: (31:51)
Yes. Are you extending the ban on nonessential travel over the US/Canada border?
Donald Trump: (31:58)
US/Canada?
Speaker 10: (31:59)
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Donald Trump: (32:00)
We’re dealing with, the Prime Minister is a friend of ours, and we’re very close to Canada. We just signed the USMCA, which is a big deal. And it’s with Mexico and with Canada. And we’re dealing on that subject. And we’re also, on the Southern border, as you know, the wall is going up, it’s going up very rapidly. We’re at 182 miles. Wherever we have the wall, it’s just ended. It just ended people coming into our country illegally. We’re stopping drug traffic, we’re stopping trafficking and people, mostly women, because they traffic mostly women, unfortunately. It’s a tremendously big business. It’s a horrible business and we’re stopping it. It’s a worldwide problem. This isn’t a problem for our southern border, but our southern border is a big point. And we’re stopping trafficking. The wall has had an incredible power and strength on what we’re doing. I have to say that, so we’ll have by pretty early next year, we’ll have 450 to 500 miles of wall fully built. So we’re doing a great job on the border.
Donald Trump: (33:01)
We have among the lowest numbers we’ve ever had of people coming in and we’re moving them out as soon as they come in. As they come in, we’re moving them out. Literally we’re moving them out immediately and that’s never taken place before. Meaning in the last, in modern history, it’s never taken out, never taken-
Speaker 10: (33:16)
On the question of non-essential trade, are you going to extend the ban that you’ve put in place on non-essential trade between-
Donald Trump: (33:23)
For now, yes. But we’re talking to Canada. As things clean up in terms of the plague, we’re both going to want to do the normal. Everything we want to get back to normal. I think we’re going to have a fantastic year next year. I think we will do very well in the fourth quarter. And I think the transition quarter, which is coming up, we’re starting at very shortly, the third quarter. I think you’ll see some very good numbers, but you’re going to see some great numbers in the fourth quarter. And you’re going to end up doing a great year next year. You can see it. Look at the states that are opening up. They’re busy and their numbers, interestingly, going down. So they’re opening up. You look at Florida and Georgia in particular, their numbers are going down. So, we’re very confident that we’re going to have a tremendous, tremendous turnaround. And we had to turn it off artificially, and now we’re turning it back on and you’re going to see some tremendous numbers. Thank you very much. I’m going over to Capitol Hill.
Speaker 11: (34:17)
Are you going to be urging the Republican senators not to pass the Phase IV Bill immediately?"
"May 18, 2020",10:49 A.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
And a lot of good things have come out about the hydroxy. A lot of good things have come out. And you’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers, before you catch it. The frontline workers, many, many are taking it. I happen to be taking it. I happen to be taking it.
Media: (00:18)
Hydroxychloroquine?
Donald Trump: (00:20)
I’m taking it, hydroxychloroquine. Right now. Yeah. Couple of weeks ago I started taking it. Because I think it’s good. I’ve heard a lot of good stories. And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you right. I’m not going to get hurt by it. It’s been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things. I’d take it. Frontline workers take it. A lot of doctors take it. Excuse me. A lot of doctors take it. I take it. Now, I hope to not be able to take it soon because I hope they come up with some answer. But I think people should be allowed to. I got a letter from a doctor the other day from Westchester, New York, around the area. He didn’t want anything. He just said, “Sir, I have hundreds of patients and I give them hydroxychloroquine. I give them the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin. And I give them zinc. And out of the hundreds of patients, many hundreds, over 300 patients, I haven’t lost one.” He said, “Please keep pressing that, sir.”
Donald Trump: (01:19)
And if you look at that phony report that was put in, that report on the hydroxy was given to people that were in extraordinarily bad condition, extraordinary bad. People that were dying. No, I think for whatever it’s worth, I take it. I would have told you that three, four days ago, but we never had a chance because you never asked me the question.
Media: (01:42)
Did the White House doctor recommend that you take that? Is that why you’re taking it?
Donald Trump: (01:46)
Yeah, White House doctor. He didn’t recommend it. No, I asked him, “What do you think?” He said, “Well, if you’d like it.” I said, “Yeah, I’d like it. I’d like to take it.” A lot of people are taking it. A lot of frontline workers are taking hydroxychloroquine. I don’t take it because hey, people said, “Oh, maybe he owns the company.” No, I don’t own the company. You know what? I want the people of this nation to feel good. I don’t want them being sick. And there’s a very good chance that this has an impact, especially early on. But you look at frontline workers, you look at doctors and nurses, a lot of them are taking it as a preventative. And they’re taking, totally unrelated, but they take the Z-Pak or the azithromycin for possible infection. Now, I haven’t taken that other than an original dose because all you need, you don’t have to take it simultaneously. But the zinc, you do take. So I’m taking the two, the zinc and the hydroxy. And all I can tell you is so far, I seem to be okay.
Media: (02:47)
Can you explain, sir, though, why you started taking it? Have you been exposed?
Donald Trump: (02:51)
No. No, not at all. I just said that I’ve had so many letters from people like the one I told you about, I got it last week. Would you like a copy of it? I’d love to give you … If you ask Molly, she’ll give you a copy of it. But this is a doctor. He doesn’t want anything. I don’t know him, never heard of him. But he treats people that we’re talking about. And he said out of hundreds of people that he’s treated, he hasn’t lost one. And he just wanted me to know about it. That’s all. He wasn’t saying, “Gee, can I have dinner with you, Mr. President? I’d like to come to the White House.”
Donald Trump: (03:21)
But I’ve received many such letters. I’ve received a lot of positive letters. And it seems to have an impact. And maybe it does, maybe it doesn’t. But if it doesn’t, you’re not going to get sick or die. This is a pill that’s been used for a long time, for 30, 40 years on the malaria and on lupus too. And even on arthritis, I guess, from what I understand. So it’s been heavily tested in terms of … I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this, when I announced this, but I’ve taken it for about a week and a half now and I’m still here. I’m still here.
Media: (03:59)
Can you explain, sir, though, what is the evidence that it has a preventative effect?
Donald Trump: (04:04)
Here we go, you ready? Here’s my evidence. I get a lot of positive calls about it. The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it, was it the VA? With people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it. And we’ve done the greatest job, maybe of anything in the VA, because I got VA Choice and VA Accountability both approved. Accountability, Tillman, is where you can fire bad people that work in the VA that you couldn’t fire them. We had thousands of people that were sadists, that were stealing, that were robbers, that were horrible people. They’d beat up our veterans. They couldn’t do it in primetime, but they did it when they were sick. And we got accountability. Nobody thought you could get it because of the unions and civil service. I got it passed so that now you fire bad people in the VA. We got rid of tremendously bad people that should never been there.
Donald Trump: (04:53)
But I also got, probably even more importantly, if you can say that, maybe not, VA Choice. So if you have to wait on line for a doctor, you go outside, you have a private doctor, we pay the bill. We work out deals with doctors. We have pricing. So you go out and you pay the bill. And it was a great thing that we did. So we’ve done a great job with the VA, but they had a report come out. And the results of the report, it was very unscientific report by the way.
Donald Trump: (05:18)
But I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy. And I say, “Hey, you know the expression I’ve used, John? What do you have to lose?” Okay, what do you have to lose? So I have been taking it for about a week and a half.
Media: (05:34)
Every day?
Donald Trump: (05:35)
Every day, I take a pill every day. At some point, I’ll stop. What I’d like to do is I’d like to have the cure and/or the vaccine and that’ll happen, I think, very soon.
Media: (05:48)
And you’ve had no symptoms, sir?
Donald Trump: (05:49)
Zero symptoms. No, I haven’t had any. No, I tested. I test every couple of days, they want to test me, for obvious reasons. I mean, I am the President. So they want to test me. I don’t want to be tested, but they want to test me. So every couple of days I get tested. And I’ve shown always negative, right? Negative. Is that the term you use for this? Right? Negative. Totally negative. No symptoms, no nothing. But no, I take it because I think I hear very good things. Again, you have to go to frontline workers. Many frontline workers take it and they seem to be doing very well."
"May 13, 2020",Uknown,"Speaker 1: (01:17:40)
Appreciate all the support you’re giving us and for leadership of our governors.
Donald Trump: (01:17:46)
And that’s what we’re doing. That’s what we’re here for to do that and to talk about. We just came out with a new listing on testing. We just cracked 10 million tests, which is here. I thought you’d like to show that to everybody, 10 million. We set an all time record by far. If you look down here, these are other countries that have not done anywhere near what we’re doing.
Donald Trump: (01:18:08)
We double. If you add them up and double them, we’ve done more tests, but I can’t get the press to print that unfortunately, they just don’t want to print it, but I want to thank the governors for being here very much. We appreciate it. We’re going to have some good fruitful talks about going even to the next step and I know you’re trying to open up and I know you’re opening up.
Donald Trump: (01:18:31)
You’re sort of more than trying. You’re opening up and you’re both do an excellent job and it’s an honor to have you at the White House very much and these two gentlemen have done a fantastic job. And David, from interior and David’s very much involved with the states and how are they doing David? What do you think?
David Bernhardt: (01:18:48)
Fantastic.
Donald Trump: (01:18:49)
I think so. They’re doing a good job. They really are. They’re doing a good job. We’re talking about Space Force and a lot of the States are interested in Space Force and we’re talking to some of them and I know that Colorado is very interested in it. And so we’ll be talking to you about that too. Okay. We might mention that today a little bit during our meeting. So thank you all very much. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (01:19:11)
Mr. President, what’s your advice administrators and school principals around the country in terms of their plans to reopen school and colleges in the fall.
Donald Trump: (01:19:22)
I think they should open the schools, absolutely. I think they should and it’s had very little impact on young people and I think that if you’re an instructor, if you’re a teacher, a professor, and you’re over a certain age, let’s say 65, or maybe even if you want to be conservative 60, perhaps you want to stay out for a little while longer, but I think you should absolutely open the schools.
Donald Trump: (01:19:45)
Our country is got to get back and it’s got to get back as soon as possible and I don’t consider our country coming back if the schools are closed and it’s had very little, very unusual situation, it’s had very little impact on young people and I would strongly say they should open. It’s up to the governors. It’s the governor’s choice, but the state is not open if the schools aren’t open, so again, it’s had very little impact on young people and I think they should open their schools.
Speaker 3: (01:20:13)
Mr. President, Senator Graham is introduced a bill to sanction China. Would you support it if it goes to the House and it comes to your desk. Do you support that bill?
Donald Trump: (01:20:24)
Well, I respect Lindsey Graham and I’ll certainly look at the bill to sanction China, so I’ll certainly take a look at it. I have not seen it yet.
Speaker 4: (01:20:31)
Are you going to comment on the release of those names of [inaudible 01:20:34].
Donald Trump: (01:20:34)
Well the unmasking, it’s a massive thing. I just got a list, who can believe a thing like this and I watched Biden yesterday on Good Morning America being interviewed by one of your colleagues, George Stephanopoulos, and he said he knew nothing about anything. He has no idea. He knows nothing about anything, nothing at all.
Donald Trump: (01:20:59)
Then it gets released today that he was a big unmasker, so how do you know nothing if you’re one of the unmaskers? It’s one of the very big stories and I suspect you’ll have, if it’s possible, even bigger stories coming out.
Speaker 5: (01:21:13)
Can I follow up with on a separate sidekick sir, we’ve had a number of explosions in Afghanistan, are you concerned that that piece deal may be falling apart?
Donald Trump: (01:21:25)
Look, Afghanistan, we’ve been there for many years, we’re like a police force, we’re not fighting in Afghanistan. We’re a police force in Afghanistan and at some point they’re going to have to be able to take care of their country. They’re going to have to be able to police their country, but we’re not meant to be a police force. We’re meant to be fighters and we’ve been there for a long time, so I don’t know.
Donald Trump: (01:21:44)
Well have to see it. I have not heard that. In Kabul, we’ve had some, I understand some pretty big blow ups, but again, you count on the government to be able to police themselves and they’re having a hard time, I suspect. But again, we are the greatest fighting force in the world. We’re not a police force that’s going to stay around and police the streets and check out the red lights and traffic.
Donald Trump: (01:22:11)
It’s not what we’re supposed to be doing. Been there a long time. You know, our forces down quite a bit, as you know, we’re way down and a lot of people have come back, brought them back, but the government has to be able at some point to do something for themselves.
Speaker 6: (01:22:30)
[crosstalk 01:22:30] probably today Germany [inaudible 01:22:32] said both that he wasn’t interested in bringing interest rates negative and that he saw a need for additional stimulus from Congress. I know that you said we could wait and see the stimulus and that you want negative rates, so what’s your reaction.
Donald Trump: (01:22:47)
Well, I’m a believer in negative rates, only if other countries that are competitors. Like Germany, they’re an ally, they’re friends of ours, but they’re still competitors on trade and other things. So Germany, Japan, others have negative rates and I think if they do, we’re the most prime of the world. It’s based in many countries, based on the dollar, the dollar is by far the strongest, most powerful currency in the world.
Donald Trump: (01:23:11)
We’ve made it more powerful. We’ve made it stronger and certainly if they’re going to have the advantage of negative rates, we should too. I feel strongly we should have negative rates. Negative rates is basically where they pay you interest if you borrow money, this is a new one. I’ve been looking for something like that all my life. That’s a pretty good one, but certainly if other countries are going to be paid for putting out money.
Donald Trump: (01:23:34)
I mean, think of it, they’re borrowing money and instead of paying interest, they’re getting paid. It’s the craziest thing, but you know what other countries are doing it. Look at Germany, look at Japan, look at others and we’re the most prime in the world right now and we have the currency and we have the power of the dollar. I know that the chairman has… And he’s done a very good job over the last couple of months. I have to tell you that because I’ve been critical, but in many ways, I call him my MIP. Do you know what I…
Donald Trump: (01:24:03)
But in many ways I call him my MIP. Do you know what an MIP is? Most improved player. It’s called the most improved player award. Did you ever get one of them when you were playing baseball, Corey? Good baseball player?
Reporter: (01:24:12)
Certainly not.
Donald Trump: (01:24:14)
The chairman, he’s my MIP right now for the last few months. I think he’s done a very good job. I disagree with him on one thing now. That’s negative rates and only because we’re paying zero. Good news with this money, you’re talking about other stimulus. We’re paying zero. We’re down to zero interest. That’s good, but some countries and some states rather, and some also countries you look at. But we are paying, right now, zero and other countries are paying less than that if you can believe it. They’re receiving money and I think we should be in the exact same situations.
Donald Trump: (01:24:56)
And by the way, states are getting tremendous deals in borrowing. So a lot of the states that are coming to the federal government, they can go out and they can borrow. They’re getting phenomenal rates. Some of our states is what I’m talking about. They’re getting phenomenal borrowing rates.
Reporter: (01:25:11)
Would you agree that stimulus should move forward? There’s been some Republicans who suggest that [crosstalk 01:25:16]
Donald Trump: (01:25:16)
I don’t know. It depends. It’s certainly not the package that I saw today. Basically, if you look at that package, what they want more than anything else is it’s a voting package. They want to be able to make sure that Republicans can’t win an election by putting in all sorts of mailing ballots. Now, I don’t know if you do because the press doesn’t report this too much, but we had two very big victories last night. We won very big. Tom Tiffany won very big in the great state of Wisconsin.
Donald Trump: (01:25:45)
You saw that. That was last night it came in. That was a big one. You saw that Doug. Won by a very, very substantial margin. In California of all places, we had a fantastic race and this was all mail in ballots. This was all a mailed ballots. When they saw because it was mail, they saw they were losing three days ago and they ended up putting polling booths in, into basically Democrat areas. But despite that, it’s looking like Mike Garcia … I don’t know if they’ve called the race yet, but he was substantially ahead. That’s the problem with mail in ballots. Are they going to dump a whole pile of ballots on your desk just before the election? So the problem with the mail in ballots, it’s subject to tremendous corruption, tremendous corruption, cheating. So I’m against it. If you look at the bill that Nancy Pelosi is putting in, has a lot to do with elections. We’re not going to lose elections because of that.
Donald Trump: (01:26:45)
I do think you should mention the fact that the Republicans won two major congressional seats last night. I think it’s really worthy of mentioning.
Reporter: (01:26:58)
Do you believe that the judge presiding over the Mike Flynn case limits [crosstalk 01:27:01]
Donald Trump: (01:27:01)
Let’s finish with your question.
Reporter: (01:27:03)
Is that bill a nonstarter? Is there anything in there you could support?
Donald Trump: (01:27:06)
Well, as they say DOA, right? DOA, dead on arrival. Of course, Nancy Pelosi knows that, obviously.
Reporter: (01:27:18)
Thank you, Mr. President. Do you believe that the judge presiding over the Michael Flynn case, Emmett Sullivan ought to recuse himself or be disqualified for being biased against Mr. Flint?
Donald Trump: (01:27:30)
I was just with General Millie and some other generals. I asked them about General Flynn. Do you know him? They said, “Yes, sir. I’ve known him for 20 years.” What do you think? “He’s an incredible man, an incredible soldier. He’s an incredible general.” This is General Millie, head of the joint chiefs of staff, four-star. He’s done fantastically. He thinks General Flynn is a great, great gentleman and a real fighter. When I see what is happening to him, it’s disgraceful and it was all a ruse. By the way, the FBI said he didn’t lie. The FBI said he did not lie. So with all this stuff I’m hearing about lying, the FBI said he didn’t lie. But the sleazebag said, “Well, we don’t care what they say. We’re saying he lied.” Okay, but the FBI, you remember when they left, they said he didn’t lie.
Donald Trump: (01:28:29)
What they’ve done to that man and that family is a disgrace, but I just tell you that because I just left General Millie. He said, “A great man and a great soldier.”
Donald Trump: (01:28:41)
I won’t talk about that, but he’s going to be okay. He’s going to be just fine.
Donald Trump: (01:28:45)
I’m very, very saddened by what’s happening to General Flynn and others. I want to tell you right now and others. Please.
Reporter: (01:28:54)
Dr. Fauci yesterday was a little cautious on reopening the economy too soon. Do you share his concerns?
Donald Trump: (01:29:00)
About reopening what?
Reporter: (01:29:01)
Reopening the economy to soon in some states.
Donald Trump: (01:29:06)
Look, he wants to play all sides of the equation. I think we’re going to have a tremendous fourth quarter. I think we’re going to have a transitional third quarter. I think we’re going to have a phenomenal next year. I feel that we are going to have a country that’s ready to absolutely have one of its best years. Next year, with all of the stimulus and all of the fact that it’s a pent up demand like I haven’t seen. You see it right now. These two really professional, good governors that work so hard. I know both of them very well. One happens to be a Democrat, but we’ve worked together and I think we’ve worked together very well. One, you would expect me to say that, but it happens to be true. Really good job too. But we’ve worked very, very well together. They want to get their states open. Some governors and some perhaps partisans, maybe for election reasons, don’t want to have their states open. Then some shouldn’t open them quite yet. They’re not ready. They went through a lot and they’re not quite ready, but no we’re opening our country. People want it open. The schools are going to be open. I was seeing the other day, Purdue is a great school, great college university.
Donald Trump: (01:30:24)
Purdue is opening and others are opening, and they’re all announcing it. These are young people. These are students, young students. They’re in great shape. They’re in great shape. Now when you have an incident, one out of a million, one out of 500, that well something happen perhaps. You can be driving to school and some bad things can happen too. So no, we’re going to open our country. We want it open.
Reporter: (01:30:48)
When you say Dr. Fauci is playing both sides, are you suggesting that the advice he’s giving to is different?
Donald Trump: (01:30:54)
I was surprised by his answer actually, because it’s just to me, it’s not an acceptable answer. Especially when it comes to schools. The only thing that would be acceptable as I said, is professors, teachers, et cetera, over a certain age. I think they ought to take it easy for another few weeks, five weeks, four weeks. Who knows whatever it may be. But I think they have to be careful because this is a disease that attacks age. It attacks health. If you have a heart problem, if you have diabetes, if you’re a certain age, it’s certainly much more dangerous. But with the young children and students, it’s really … just take a look at the statistics. It’s pretty amazing.
Reporter: (01:31:39)
Mr. President, businesses are concerned about getting sued once they reopen? Will you be insistent on some sort of shield from liability being in a phase four bill?
Donald Trump: (01:31:49)
If anythings done, I will do that. These are the new testing numbers. So you saw that, but I was just showing this to a group of people. I said we’re now over 10 million tests or we will be very shortly, like within a couple of days. Look at that test. This is us. This is the rest of the world. We have more tests and we have better tests. We have more tests and we have better tests. We’re going to have your football team in, your championship football team. [inaudible 01:32:20] Tell us a little bit about the team. First of all, you know they won the championship and we’re all set to have them. What happened is the plague came in. Because of the plague, came in from China. Because of the plague, we didn’t have those great people, but we’ll do a rain check. But seriously, even if it’s in a few months, we’ll do a rain check. Tell them about the team because it was a tremendous season.
Doug Burgum: (01:32:47)
Well, I’ll just say that the team and Senator Hoeven was here, Senator Kramer was here, the whole codel, the first lady was here. She says, hi. But you hosted them last year because they again, won the national championship this year in January. This is the eighth out of ninth year in a row they’ve done that. They would love to get back here with the rain check.
Donald Trump: (01:33:05)
So I watched the game on television, the championship game. I didn’t know too much about it. I don’t get to watch too much of the television football games. I’m saying, “Man, that team is really good.” They were really good. Then I got a call from [inaudible 01:33:18] and I get a call from John. I get a call from our other very friendly Senator, the three of them. They said, “Do you think we could possibly honor the team?” Because we honor the national champion. My question was, “How would your team do against the national champions?” They were pretty good, LSU this year, right? Not a bad quarterback. How do you think? I don’t know. You think, okay, right?
Reporter: (01:33:44)
You open up against Oregon. Next year at Oregon. So then we’ll be able to answer your question.
Donald Trump: (01:33:48)
That’s pretty good.
Doug Burgum: (01:33:48)
That great LSU quarterback started his career playing flag football in elementary school in Fargo, North Dakota. So that’s where [inaudible 01:33:54].
Donald Trump: (01:33:54)
Had a good start.
Donald Trump: (01:33:58)
Let the team know we’re going to do a rain check.
Reporter: (01:34:01)
Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (01:34:02)
Yeah.
Reporter: (01:34:03)
What will happen to the public companies that don’t return their PPP loans to the SBI by tomorrow’s deadline?
Donald Trump: (01:34:08)
Well, we’ll go after them very seriously. If there’s any companies that got loans that they weren’t entitled to, we’ll go after them very soon. They’ll have big problems.
Reporter: (01:34:17)
Mr. President, what’s your level of confidence that the Supreme Court will ultimately rule in your favor in the case involving your tax returns?
Donald Trump: (01:34:25)
I hope they will. You have a situation where a president has to be able to focus on this. When you’re doing an audit … In the old days, no president gave tax returns. A while ago, I mean, no president gave tax returns. But when you’re under audit, who would want to give them? It’s a very big thing, but it would also take time. Ultimately, people are going to be getting returns. They’re going to see that. But I think it went very well yesterday. I have great respect for the Supreme Court. I think the lawyers put out a very strong case. From what I’ve read, it was a very strong case. Yeah, please.
Reporter: (01:35:11)
How long do you and the vice president plan to stay apart distance wise?
Donald Trump: (01:35:16)
Well, it’s an interesting question. I haven’t seen Mike Pence and I miss him, but he was in the room with somebody that tested positive. He did not test positive. He tested the opposite. He’s in good shape. But I guess we said for a little while, we’ll stay apart because you don’t know what happens with this very crazy and horrible disease. But we speak a lot on the phone, but I’m in the White House. Mike is at his office, but he’s pretty much away from people. He’s doing a great job. He’s done a great job I think you’d say on the task force. He really has. I think you’ve pretty much gotten everything you wanted and we try and get it to you quickly.
Jared Polis: (01:36:02)
We talk to the vice president regularly.
Donald Trump: (01:36:06)
We work very well together with Republican governors and with Democrat governors. When are you thinking of opening and explain what you’re going to do [inaudible 01:36:16]
Jared Polis: (01:36:18)
Most businesses are open in Colorado, pretty much everything except for those social businesses like bars and nightclubs. A few places have restaurants open. We’re working on the rest soon, but offices, manufacturing, salons, pretty much all people are back in a safer way. It’s not the same way it was. I got my hair cut the other day.
Donald Trump: (01:36:38)
It looks good.
Jared Polis: (01:36:39)
Thank you. You should have seen it before. It was crazy, what little is left of it.
Donald Trump: (01:36:42)
Not bad. Not bad.
Jared Polis: (01:36:45)
They wore a mask. I wore a mask. So we’re doing it in a safe way. All the stores are back. April 27th, we were one of the states where we wanted to do that in a safe way. People are being responsible. It’s that individual responsibility that’s going to make sure that we can stay on this trajectory. Hopefully restaurants in May, by the end of May. They’re already opening a few places in our state.
Donald Trump: (01:37:06)
How about because I go there, as you know. The ski slopes are fantastic. There are those that say the greatest anywhere. How are you doing with the skiing? It’s a big business for you.
Jared Polis: (01:37:17)
It’s a big business. It’s also one of the reasons that we got a lot of the virus in our state because people come from all over the world. All over the world.
Donald Trump: (01:37:23)
That’s very true. I’ve heard that.
Jared Polis: (01:37:24)
So that’s what led to the spread. So most of the ski season is ending, but we’re actually hopeful. A lot of people don’t know this, but in Colorado we have a few areas that they’re skiing through July 4th. We’re hoping that people will be able to ski again. David knows, the secretary Bernard knows this. In [inaudible 01:37:41] Wolf Creek, maybe Breckenridge, Loveland in June. We’re hoping that people can actually ski again.
Donald Trump: (01:37:45)
You also did a lot of a summer business and springtime business. What are you doing with that?
Jared Polis: (01:37:50)
It’s we really respecting the communities in our state because they have a lot at stake. Nobody is more at stake than … In fact, Jill Ryan who’s with us from Eagle. She’s our secretary of health in Colorado. She was a commissioner in Eagle County, which is where bail is. So they have the most at stake economically and from a health perspective. We’re really respecting what the different communities decide. I think there’ll be some folks that are coming back, spending money in stores. There’ll be other communities that say, “You know what? We have to wait a little bit longer.” It’s been very traumatic for many of those communities because Eagle County for awhile, had the highest infection rate in the country early on.
Donald Trump: (01:38:25)
I heard that.
Jared Polis: (01:38:26)
Yeah, early on. [crosstalk 01:38:27]
Donald Trump: (01:38:27)
Now there’s people coming because everyone goes, everyone coming in. How has that been? How is the level of infection right now?
Jared Polis: (01:38:34)
Eagle County has done an amazing job, as has Summit County, Picking County, Aspen. All those areas, they’ve gotten it under control because they acted early. They have great county health departments. They look at the science, they look at the data. Their residents stayed home. In fact, Eagle County was one of the first in our state, along with Mesa County, which secretary Bernard knows well in Grand Junction area, to be able to open up a little bit ahead of some of the other areas in a safer way. In a safer way. So like in Grand Junction, the restaurants are at 25% capacity. So there’s space. We’re looking at ways that people can dine outdoors, sidewalks, and even on a lane of the road because it’s safer to be in that environment. So those are the kinds of things that we think about as we’re just trying to get back to as much normalcy as we can.
Donald Trump: (01:39:17)
Corey you’re working together very much I know with the governor and everybody else.
Speaker 9: (01:39:21)
We do. We speak regularly. The government’s done a good job and I appreciate that. Here to help as much as we can.
Jared Polis: (01:39:26)
One of the things we did that Corey introduced us to and worked on, was importing some tests from South Korea. So they’re already being used in our state. We’re also partnering with the vice president and you on some Thermo Fisher tests that we think are coming very soon. We’re getting I think 95,000 [crosstalk 01:39:44]
Donald Trump: (01:39:44)
We’re still over here.
Jared Polis: (01:39:44)
Good.
Donald Trump: (01:39:45)
And we’re getting them very quickly.
Jared Polis: (01:39:46)
Good. We’re excited because we’re running through those tests from South Korea. That’s what’s so important is the supplies. We have the ability to do it, the labs to do it. You guys sent around the labs. We have the capacity, but it’s getting the tests in. Both with the Thermo Fisher test, the Abbott test, the [inaudible 01:40:03] tests, we’re mixing and matching across. We have 32 free community testing sites across our state. Some of them you drive in, some of them you walk in, but those are free. That’s in addition to the hospitals and doctor’s offices. Of course, you get tested there. But we have 32 free community testing sites [crosstalk 01:40:19]
Donald Trump: (01:40:19)
And you have good healthcare in that state.
Colorado Rep: (01:40:22)
Mr. President, so I think the key that Jared is talking about, the governor talks about is you have counties that have a plan they’re able to open up earlier than others because of the work that they’re doing. When the governor is talking about Grand Junction, you have restaurants that aren’t just open, but you have dine in. In some of these restaurants, which I think is maybe some of the first around the country to actually reopen to dine in because of the good work that they have done together.
Jared Polis: (01:40:44)
Then we wanted to, for our restaurants who were open throughout this whole period in our state. They just did delivery. They did take out, they did curbside. We even waived some of the laws so they could sell alcohol curbside and sell alcohol delivery, because that extra piece can make the difference between them staying in business or not.
Donald Trump: (01:41:00)
How did they do? How did those restaurants do with the take out?
Jared Polis: (01:41:03)
You’ll hear from some that are doing okay with it. It doesn’t work for every restaurant and that’s why they need to be open for the in restaurant dining. But for many of them, it’s paid their bills and they’ve gotten through it, and it’s helped them.
Donald Trump: (01:41:13)
That’s good. That’s good.
Jared Polis: (01:41:13)
Not every restaurant, but I hear those stories that it’s helped them get through it. That we’ve been able to make sure they’ve been able to stay in business the whole time.
Donald Trump: (01:41:19)
Good job.
Colorado Rep: (01:41:19)
Yesterday we talked as well about Colorado’s additional Thermal Fisher tests, and that’ll be a very big help to get those.
Donald Trump: (01:41:25)
That’s a great test. That’s a new and a great test. So Doug, how about North Dakota? How you doing?
Doug Burgum: (01:41:31)
Well, first I want to just lead with gratitude and say thank you to you for your leadership, and the vice president, and Dr. Bergson. The whole team has been a great partnership federal to state, to local and North Dakota. Secondly, wanted to say thanks to all the great people in North Dakota, because like Jared in Colorado, we relied a lot on individual responsibility, light touch from government and had great results. Here we sit today, we’re number two in the nation. We passed New York this week in terms of testing per capita. So we’ve really driven in. We’ve tested over 6% of the population.
Donald Trump: (01:42:03)
Great. And you’re using different tests, all different and you’re in good shape with the testing. What test are you using?
Doug Burgum: (01:42:08)
Well, this has all been the PCR, the nucleic acid testing. It’s been across a number of different platforms, Thermal Fisher, Avid, Panther. So we’ve got a variety of different platforms, but most of it driven through our state lab, which has had an order of magnitude increase. So we’ve gone to three shifts a day and each shift is doing more than three times they did before. So 10X increase going on there on the testing site.
Donald Trump: (01:42:30)
That’s fantastic.
Doug Burgum: (01:42:31)
Then we’re the fifth lowest positivity rate in the country. Alaska and Hawaii are ahead of us, but we’ve been right at the bottom in terms of that. You take those two things together-
Donald Trump: (01:42:41)
So what do you attribute? What do you attribute that to?
Doug Burgum: (01:42:43)
Well, I would say very early on-
Donald Trump: (01:42:46)
Being a good governor.
Doug Burgum: (01:42:47)
Well, geography helps and the people of the state helped. Those two things, but I’d say we took early action to try to reduce transmissible moments. So we kept 93% of the jobs in the state open, but the 7% we closed, bars and restaurants and personal care businesses. Everybody else kept going. All the construction, all of energy, all of Ag, including all of elective surgery at hospitals kept that going.
Donald Trump: (01:43:11)
Oh wow. That’s fantastic.
Doug Burgum: (01:43:13)
We were well-stocked. We had a great medical cash and [crosstalk 01:43:16]
Donald Trump: (01:43:16)
That’s great.
Doug Burgum: (01:43:16)
We never took more than 2% of our capacity in healthcare. We have a lot of great healthcare providers in North Dakota. Only 2% we’re going to COVID.
Donald Trump: (01:43:23)
That’s fantastic.
Doug Burgum: (01:43:24)
So we were able to then drive through that. We handled the virus and really focused and we got Michelle Comber here who leads our commerce department. We have less to worry about opening up because we never really closed down. But on that other 7%, we got bars, restaurants, personal care businesses open on May 1st. All that’s going very well under new operating procedures that everybody’s using to stay safe.
Donald Trump: (01:43:48)
And your oil prices are going up a little bit now. So that you’re 26, $27 a barrel. Pretty soon you’ll up to the number that you have to be up to. That’s the big difference.
Doug Burgum: (01:43:58)
Well, absolutely because what we do in North Dakota is we power the world and we feed the world. Number two oil producer, producing state in the nation. A lot of the unemployment that we saw early on wasn’t related to the virus. It was related to the demand destruction associated with the oil price drive.
Donald Trump: (01:44:13)
Great job. John, what do you have to say about the state and the job the governor and everybody else has done? I know it well.
North Dakota Rep: (01:44:20)
Listening to these two governors, I was governor for a long time. It tells me your approach is the right approach. You’re working with the governors across this country and empowering them to open up as soon as they can safely, based on the conditions in their state and every state’s different. That’s why that approach is so important. Then you providing all that support, along with us in Congress with the Cares Act as well. But you see that now with North Dakota, with Colorado, and across the country. So that’s why it’s so important that you’re doing it the way that you’re doing it with these great governors that we have across the state. So thank you for that.
North Dakota Rep: (01:44:58)
The other thing I want to mention is for our farmers. You know I work a lot on Ag.
Donald Trump: (01:45:01)
Yes.
North Dakota Rep: (01:45:01)
But for our farmers and ranchers, you’ve been there for them and hang in there with them. They’re doing a whale of a job and they’re so important, and our energy industry too.
Donald Trump: (01:45:10)
We’re sending them billions of dollars of money that we took in from a country that targeted them. Last year, we gave them 16 billion. The year before, we gave them 12 billion. No other president would have done that, I can tell you.
North Dakota Rep: (01:45:24)
That’s really important and appreciated. We need to hang in there with them. The only other thing I got to tell you is we have a great governor as you know, but he is so data driven that I was teasing Dr. Birx. Who’s more data driven? These two are amazing.
Donald Trump: (01:45:38)
She is.
North Dakota Rep: (01:45:38)
They’re amazing together. They’re just amazing.
Donald Trump: (01:45:41)
That’s great. Michelle, do you have anything to say?
Michelle: (01:45:45)
Well, it’s been a privilege to work for governor of Oregon. I think it’s through his wisdom that we’ve talked a lot about lowering the curve. But as governor [inaudible 01:45:54] pointed out, we didn’t close the state. So I feel like-
Donald Trump: (01:45:56)
That’s so good.
Michelle: (01:45:57)
We raised the bottom and we’ve had the good fortune to work very, very closely with our business community. It’s through that process and the open dialogue, and the collaboration, and the hyper connectedness in our state, that we were able to build what we call North Dakota smart, restart protocols with our business community over the span of about eight days. So we were closed for 40 days and 40 nights and we are opening in a safe way.
Donald Trump: (01:46:23)
That’s fantastic.
Michelle: (01:46:23)
We’re really proud of the work that’s happening.
Donald Trump: (01:46:25)
You’ve done a great job. Thank you very much. Just to finish off, go ahead.
Colorado Rep: (01:46:30)
Well, hi. Thank you Mr. President. I want to thank the federal government for its partnership on our COVID-19 response. Particularly, the supplies you’ve given us, the tests. Look forward to that continuing and the more people we can test, and then we can force multiply that with contact tracing. So we can quarantine people that haven’t even had a test yet. That’s really the way that we’re going to contain the virus in Colorado. We’ve got a local public health department that covers every county. They are ready to do testing and contact tracing. So that’s our plan. It’s going to be a statewide effort.
Donald Trump: (01:47:12)
Well, thank you very much. Terrific job too.
Doug Burgum: (01:47:15)
While we’re here I want to also say, Secretary Bernhardt, doing a fantastic job because we had a chance to interact with him on national parks. We had great things going on in the Theodore Roosevelt National Park. As we move ahead with the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library, we’ve got the US Fish and Wildlife BLM. We’ve been great partners working with the five tribal nations that are headquartered in North Dakota, with whom we share geography. We’ve done great collaboration with those tribal leaders on testing through COVID. But I just want to thank the secretary.
Donald Trump: (01:47:45)
They’ve had a lot of difficulty in the different tribes, haven’t they? A lot of difficulty. Tremendous difficulty.
Doug Burgum: (01:47:48)
Thank you secretary [inaudible 01:47:49] and for all their support as well through all this.
Donald Trump: (01:47:52)
David, you’ve done a great job. Do you feel comfortable with all those cameras right behind your head?
Speaker 9: (01:47:57)
You gave me clear direction to work with governors to open things up. We worked with local communities. Our parks, my goal is that we’re right on the shoulder of the governor. We’ve worked with [Larimer 01:48:11] County Health Department and [inaudible 01:48:14] park to bring that online. We’ve opened up Theodore Roosevelt. We just announced today, the timing of the opening for Yellowstone. So we’re moving forward.
Donald Trump: (01:48:26)
So you getting those parks open, right?
Speaker 9: (01:48:28)
Absolutely.
Donald Trump: (01:48:29)
I hope everybody’s listening. The parks are opening and rapidly actually.
Speaker 9: (01:48:33)
With those governors.
Donald Trump: (01:48:34)
And with those governors. You want the help for the governors.
Jared Polis: (01:48:37)
Even with the counties [crosstalk 01:48:38] even within the state. We’re all excited because recreating outdoors is safe and healthy. The flip side is, we’re not yet ready to have all the people from other states and other countries coming in. So that’s the battle.
Speaker 9: (01:48:48)
That’s why we’re collaborating with those local communities to ramp [crosstalk 01:48:52]
Donald Trump: (01:48:51)
So in all cases, you’re working with governors and opening up-
Speaker 9: (01:48:54)
And local towns.
Donald Trump: (01:48:55)
That’s good.
Speaker 9: (01:48:56)
Absolutely.
Donald Trump: (01:48:56)
That’s great. Great job. Thank you.
Reporter: (01:48:58)
Good neighbor.
Donald Trump: (01:48:58)
Thank you very much, everybody. [crosstalk 01:49:07]
Donald Trump: (01:49:08)
They have great confidence and they have great confidence in us. They have great confidence in the airlines. We’ve saved the airlines with $25 billion and another $25 billion. We have airlines that are now in good shape. Obviously, they’re going to pick up with the fares and with the seats, but the airline industry is in good shape. We’ve been able to save the airline industry, which would have been devastating if that happened. So they’re in good shape. Thank you very much."
"May 11, 2020",5:38 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
We’re here to provide an update on the unprecedented testing capacity developed by the United States, the most advanced and robust testing system anywhere in the world by far. This afternoon I’ll also announce new steps that we’re taking to make test even more widely available. To battle the virus, my administration marshaled every resource at our nation’s disposal, public, private, military, economic, scientific and industrial all at your disposal. We launched the largest manufacturing ramp up since the second world war, there has been nothing like it since. At the center of this industrial and scientific mobilization, was the development of our coronavirus testing capabilities. In the span of just a few short months, we’ve developed a testing capacity unmatched and unrivaled anywhere in the world, and it’s not even close. This is a core element of our plan to safely and gradually reopen America, and we’re opening and we’re starting and there’s enthusiasm like I haven’t seen in a long time. Every American should be proud of the amazing array of talent, skill and enterprise our nation has brought to this challenge. In three months, the FDA has authorized more than 92 different tests, and over 9 million have been performed here in the United States. Three weeks ago, we were conducting roughly 150,000 tests per day, now we’re doing approximately 300,000 tests per day, a 100% increase, and it will go up substantially from that number. This week the United States will pass 10 million tests conducted nearly double the number of any other country, we’re testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland and many other countries, and in some cases combined.
Donald Trump: (01:50)
On Friday, the FDA authorized coronavirus antigen test, an alternative testing technology that can be much more readily manufactured. Quidel Corporation, which makes this newly authorized point of care test estimates that it will be able to manufacture 150,000 tests per day, immediately increasing to 300,000 tests per day within just a few weeks. To further expand our nation’s testing capabilities, this afternoon I am announcing that my administration … and we’ve got this all approved, it’s all done, is sending $ 1 billion to America states, territories and tribes. So, this has all been approved, we’ve gotten it done completed, the money is going out. This major investment will ensure that America continues to conduct more tests than any country on earth by far. I said from the beginning that the federal government would back up the states and help them build their testing capability and capacities, and that’s exactly what’s happened.
Donald Trump: (02:56)
This partnership has truly flourished, we have really had a very good relationship with the states and the governors and other representatives within the states. A relationship I think I can honestly say has not been seen in this country for many, many years. The governors and us are working together very closely, not only in testing but on ventilators where we have a capacity that’s at this point virtually unlimited, and we’re sending ventilators, as you probably heard from other countries, we’re sending many, many thousands of ventilators to other countries because they’re in tremendous need. I think building up a lot of Goodwill, but much more importantly than that we’re saving a lot of lives. Most states are now doing a great job. My administration allocated 5,000 machines and 700 labs across all 50 states, and governors have learned how to maximize these testing resources.
Donald Trump: (03:54)
The federal government is also supporting states with vital supplies, quick approvals of new tests, and one on one coaching from the team here at the White House on how to increase capacity and increase it very quickly. In recent weeks, we’ve held multiple conference calls with every state, as well as with DC and Puerto Rico. We jointly developed testing projections and goals for each state for the month of may altogether, totalling 12.9 million tests, think of that 12.9 million tests. Today I’m announcing that my administration will provide the collection supplies to help states meet their targets and meet them rapidly. During the month of may, FEMA and HHS will be delivering 12.9 million swaps to states nationwide. We already have them, the delivery will be very quick. We’re prepared to provide millions of additional swabs if any state is on a pace to surpass its goal and their goals are very high. We’ve set them very high, we’ve told them to set them very high.
Donald Trump: (04:56)
My administration will also provide approximately 9 million transport media, which are used to transfer swabs to the lab processing, a complicated process, but we’ve made it simple. As a result of these actions, every single state will be able to test more people per capita in May alone than South Korea has tested in four months since the outbreak began. This major commitment is possible because of the massive mobilization of American industry, including Puritan Medical Products, U.S. Cotton, Abbott Labs, and Thermo Fisher. Some of these incredible companies produce rapidly for us, and their products are here with us this afternoon. These are all different products that were literally just developed, and if you can imagine that, and these are the best machines and the best equipment anywhere in the world and other countries are calling us and we’re trying to work as much as we can, not only on ventilators, but also with testing.
Donald Trump: (05:56)
My administration also continues our tireless effort to expand testing in the most underserved communities through our partnership with the private sector, leading pharmacies and retailers are now operating over 240 testing sites across the country, and that’s in addition to all of the other sites that we have working, 70% of these sites are located in communities with unique vulnerabilities. There will be more than 300 sites by the end of this week, and retailers are making plans to open up hundreds and hundreds more locations within the next 30 days. These additional sites are helping us ensure access to testing in every community. My administration is fighting relentlessly to protect all citizens of every color and creed from this terrible virus, the invisible enemy.
Donald Trump: (06:46)
In addition to vast amounts of testing supplies, my administration has partnered with the private sector to coordinate the delivery of more than 90,000,095 masks, and these are of the highest quality. Many are made right here in the United States, a capacity we didn’t have it all at the beginning. 126 million surgical masks, likewise many are made here, 9 million face shields, 21 million surgical gowns, 993 million gloves and 10,690 ventilators, we’re building thousands of ventilators and numerous plants all across our country, it’s incredible actually. This global pandemic has inflicted great pain and hardship on our people, it should have never been allowed to happen, it should have been stopped at the source. We mourn for every life the virus has claimed, and we share the grief of all of you who have lost a loved one, and that goes worldwide to many, many countries, 184 countries at least.
Donald Trump: (07:52)
Thanks to the courage of our citizens and our aggressive strategy, hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved, and we have saved. If you look at on a per 100,000 basis, we’re at the best part of the pack right on the bottom, Germany and us are leading the world. Germany and the United States are leading the world, lives saved per a hundred thousand. In every generation through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task. We have met the moment and we have prevailed. Americans do whatever it takes to find solutions, pioneer breakthroughs and harness the energies we need to achieve a total victory. Day after day we’re making tremendous strides with the dedication of our doctors and nurses, these are incredible people, these are brave people, these are warriors.
Donald Trump: (08:45)
With the devotion of our manufacturing workers, food suppliers, and lab technicians, and with the profound patriotism of the American people, we will defeat this horrible enemy, we will revive our economy and we will transition into greatness. That’s a phrase you’re going to hear a lot because that’s what’s going to happen. We’re going into the third quarter and we’re going to do well. In the fourth quarter, we’re going to do very good, and next year, I think we’re going to have one of the best years we’ve ever had because there’s a tremendous pent-up demand. It’s a demand and I’m feeling it, I’ve felt things a lot over my life, and I’ve made a lot of good calls. It’s a demand like I don’t think I’ve ever seen. There’s a pent-up demand, there’s a spirit in this country like few have seen.
Donald Trump: (09:34)
I think you can say, and we’ve helped a lot of the countries, a lot, really a lot. There’s a tremendous spirit all over the world to beat this terrible, terrible thing. But we’re transitioning to greatness and the greatness is going to be on the fourth quarter, but it’s really going to be next year, and it’s going to be a year like we’ve never had before. I really believe that as good as we’ve done and we’ve done great, we had the best economy in the history of the world, not just here, but anywhere in the world, you can talk China, you can talk any other country, we had the best economy anywhere in the world. We were going for numbers where there was unemployment numbers, where we had our best numbers, employment also numbers, little different where we had our best numbers, almost 160 million people. All of that, we had the greatest stock market numbers ever. I think we had 142 days where we set records in a short period of time, 152 days, we set records in the stock market.
Donald Trump: (10:38)
We rebuilt our military, all built in the United States. All of our equipment built $1.5 trillion plus. On the Southern border, the wall is being built, it’s being built rapidly. Now you don’t hear the opponents talking too much about the border, they don’t like to talk about it because it seemed that we were right on a lot of things. One of the things we are right about, one of the many things was the border, we have a very powerful border now. We had one of the best weeks in the history of our border between the United States and Mexico, our Southern border. We had very few people coming in very, very few, almost record low numbers. The wall is being built, it’s up to 181 miles already.
Donald Trump: (11:22)
It’s being built, it’s being built rapidly. People don’t talk about it anymore because it’s very successful, and the area where the wall has built, that is a lot still, but we want to be up to 450 by very short period of time. Early next year, we should be up to 450 and very shortly after that over 500 miles to be completed, but it’s had a tremendous impact. But again, we’ve had the best numbers, the last thing we want now with this pandemic is for people to come across our Southern border. Again, we’re doing record numbers, meaning record low numbers. So I just want to thank everybody, and I want to introduce Admiral Giroir, if you could please come up and Brad, if you would, Brad Smith. They’re going to do a little explaining as to what we’ve done with regard to testing and how successful it’s been. Then we’ll take some questions after that. Thank you very much.
Admiral Giroir: (12:22)
Well, thank you Mr. President for your leadership and for your high expectations that really made this all come together and for the uniform support of everyone in the White House and the administration. Thank you, secretary Azar for providing his leadership at HHS and allowing both Brad and I, the opportunity to work on this project. I think it’s clear that America does lead the world in testing. I’ll go through some of the charts that show that we lead quantitatively. I will also suggest that we lead in the diversity of tests, which are very important to establish the testing ecosystem, to keep America safe, and clearly, as we’ve said, multiple times, no one beats America when it comes to quality.
Admiral Giroir: (13:04)
So let’s start potentially with the next slide. This may be hard to see, but if you look at the line on top, that’s the total numbers of tests done by the United States. No other country in the world comes close to the total numbers. Again, as the president has said, today we will top over 9 million tests. If you look at per capita, everyone talks about South Korea being the standard, today we will have done more than twice their per capita rate of testing that was accomplished in South Korea. No matter how you look at it, America is leading the world in testing. How did we get there? Let’s look at the next slide. Next slide please. A very important component of how we came to this point, was the authorization by the FDA, under the leadership of our secretary of many different diagnostic tests of diagnostic devices and now a serology tests.
Admiral Giroir: (14:06)
So, you’ve heard a lot about the different testing and you see some of the machines up here, most of the diagnostic tests, all but one, rely on the amplification of the viral RNA, the viral genetic material. And we’ve talked to you about the diversity of tests. They’re very high throughput tests that are done at big reference labs, like LabCorp and Quest. But very importantly, there are also tests, and you heard us talk about Cepheid, delivering over 2 million tests, vitally important to rural Americas and to places that do not have very large infrastructure. You’ve also seen the Abbott’s test, we’ve talked about, there it is on the left of the president, delivering about 1.4 million tests as a point of care test.
Admiral Giroir: (14:51)
You get the result within five to 15 minutes, and we have deployed over 235,000 of these tests to the state public health laboratories in every state of this country to make sure that that point of care testing capability is there to research outbreaks like in nursing homes or in certain industrial capacities, and well over 90,000 to the Indian Health Service, so they could test at a point of care in remote locations. The president also talked about a new first in class test. It’s listed there as an antigen based test. This is very important and you’ve heard ambassador Birx talk about this multiple times, because antigen testing, although complex is much less complex than the nucleic acid testing that we’ve had.
Admiral Giroir: (15:39)
Quidel, had this authorized by the FDA, and as the president said, we’ll soon be making over 300,000 tests per day. Do the math, that’s 9 million point of care tests that we will have every month in just a few weeks. It will clearly add to and to a certain degree transform our landscape, which you don’t see up here is the important …
Admiral Giroir: (16:03)
… form our landscape. What you don’t see up here is the important work the FDA did. I’m a swab guy now. I’m very interested in swabs. In order to make all these tests work, you have to show that a certain swab, made of a certain material, performed in a certain way, delivers a highly accurate result.
Admiral Giroir: (16:18)
And what you’re seeing up here is some of the fruits of that labor. Without the authorizations, or for example, the foam nasal swab, we would be blowing through PPE all across the country because of the need for a full PPE just to take a test. That has really been changed by this diverse authorization and a recent authorization that allows the great manufacturer, U.S. Cotton, to join our foundational industry of Puritan. Next slide.
Admiral Giroir: (16:45)
Last week we did over 1.9 million tests and that number is growing. And again, as the President said and Brad will talk about, our states aspire to do well over 12 million tests over the next four weeks. You see the graph growing. What you also see very importantly is that little orange bar on the bottom is the cumulative number of positives. Our percent positives are going down, and that’s what we want to see.
Admiral Giroir: (17:10)
In fact, in 31 states as of last night, the positivity rate is less than 10%, which is not a litmus test, but is a good idea that we’re doing plenty enough testing that we can enter phase one for careful reopening. I also want to take the opportunity to say this doesn’t happen by accident. I’m seeing everyone in the audience here, and I’m so pleased that they can be here. People sitting in the front have been working literally 18 to 20 hours a day every single day of the week for at least the past two months.
Admiral Giroir: (17:42)
None of this happens by accident. It happens because their hard work, their sacrifice, their sacrifice of their family, all for a common good. And I’m very, very honored to consider you all as my colleagues. And my last slide, as the President said, $11 billion are now being announced to be delivered to the states for the sole support of testing. This will give them the resources to partner as they have with the federal government, with the President, the Vice President, the task force, with Brad and I to achieve their testing goals.
Admiral Giroir: (18:18)
And we’re going to be very specific and they know it that there needs to be minimum numbers to be planned to test. They have to have plans for their vulnerable communities, including nursing homes, including those who are disabled, including those who are in prisons or who have working environments that they may have a more likelihood to spread the infection.
Admiral Giroir: (18:39)
And combined with that, the Secretary’s Office of Minority Health will soon be awarding a large contract to guarantee a national network of state, local, and community-based organizations to assure that those underserved, particularly racial and ethnic minorities, are linked the services that they need, not only testing, but in care as well.
Admiral Giroir: (19:03)
And with that, I’d like to hand it over to Brad Smith, who’s the Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, but has really been the chief operating officer to make all of this come together. Brett.
Brad Smith: (19:16)
Thank you, Admiral. I want to talk through a little bit, specifically the work that we’ve been doing with the states. So as the Admiral mentioned, over the past few weeks, we’ve been working with each state to set a target for their testing goal for May. Over the series of a couple of different calls, we’ve aligned on what those goals are, and as the Admiral mentioned and the President mentioned, they add up to over 12.9 million tests in the month of May.
Brad Smith: (19:39)
For every state, this is greater than 2% of their population in the entire state being tested in May, and for many states, it’s a much higher number than that. When you compare this, as the President mentioned, to South Korea, South Korea is actually below that 2%, not for a month, but for their total tests to date since the start of the year. And so our states have come together to set really ambitious goals that we’re excited to support them in meeting.
Brad Smith: (20:02)
If you go to the next slide, as I talked about last time in the press briefing, there are really three parts to making sure that a test can happen. The first part is the specimen collection supplies, the second part is the machines, and the third part are the lab supplies that the machines need to run. And what we’ve been working to do is to make sure that each state has all three of those parts to be able to conduct a number of tests.
Brad Smith: (20:24)
The first part is the specimen collection supplies. The commercial market today is providing a large number of these supplies already to states and already to hospitals, but we wanted to ensure that every state had more than what they needed to be able to conduct the number of tests they’re aiming in May. So what we’ve done is we’ve purchased enough tests to support the state testing goals for May and June.
Brad Smith: (20:46)
So we will be sending more than 12.9 million swabs and over 10 million media to the states over the course of May and a similar or greater number over the course of June. In addition, we have several million in reserve. So if states are able to exceed their goal in the third and fourth week of May, we can provide them even more swabs and transport media. And again, this is in addition to what’s already available in the commercial market.
Brad Smith: (21:08)
If you go to the next slide, there are large numbers, it’s been talked about many times, a large number of testing machines across the country, over 5,000 different machines that can conduct these tests. The key part is making sure that the machines and that the labs have enough supplies to run the machines. There will be in the month of May commercially produced over 25 million test kits, which is either the PCR and extraction kits or the cartridges to be able to support states in their testing effort.
Brad Smith: (21:39)
And what we’ve been working to do with each state is understand their total goal, and each of the manufacturers has been a great partner with us and told us how many tests they’re shipping to each lab in each state over the course of May. And what we know is that in the aggregate, the number of test kits the state is getting is greater than their testing goal for month of May.
Brad Smith: (21:58)
In addition to what the states have already purchased, there’s over 7 million additional tests that remain unpurchased, the majority of those from Thermo Fisher, which is the most common machine in the country. So we feel very confident the states will not only have the specimen collection supplies and the machines, but also the extraction kits and the reagents they need to be able to hit or potentially exceed their testing goals.
Brad Smith: (22:19)
And if you go to the last slide, the last piece of the puzzle is making sure that Americans have access to these tests. Healthcare providers, hospitals, primary care physicians are already providing these tests to date. And we, for the past six or seven weeks have been partnered with the retailers who have massively been ramping up their effort.
Brad Smith: (22:36)
Today they’re over 240 retail sites. We’ve been working with the retailers to make sure that they’re specifically targeting low-income and other vulnerable communities across the country, and we’re talking with them about potentially opening more than another thousand additional sites over the next month or two.
Brad Smith: (22:52)
So we hope that we’ve put together the right pieces of the puzzle, having access points for patients and Americans across the country, having the specimen collection supplies needed to take the test, having the machines, and then also having the lab testing supplies with the machines. So thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (23:08)
Thank you very much, Brett. Maybe you’ll both stay there. Could be some questions. Okay. Please, John, go ahead.
John: (23:18)
You can’t hear me. We had a situation here at the White House on Friday where a member of the Vice President’s staff tested positive for coronavirus, which has now caused three of the top U.S. officials involved in the coronavirus response to self isolate. Two-part question. Where did the system break down to allow that to happen? And what would you say to employers who look at the experience here at the White House and say, “Are we ready for this?”
Donald Trump: (23:45)
I don’t think the system broke down at all, and one person tested positive, surprisingly, because the previous day tested negative, and three people that were in contact, relative contact, who, I believe they’ve all tested totally negative, but they are going to, for a period of time, self isolate. So that’s not breaking down.
Donald Trump: (24:04)
It can happen. It’s the hidden enemy. Remember that. It’s the hidden enemy. So things happen, but the three tested negative. The one who tested positive will be fine. It will be absolutely fine. Yeah, John? Yes?
John: (24:17)
What do you say, Mr. President, to other companies who may look at this and say, “I don’t know if we’re ready for all this”?
Donald Trump: (24:23)
Well, I think, we have a lot of people in the White House, and we had one, basically we had one person. So we had a lot of people that work here. This building is shocking if you looked at the numbers, and it’s also tremendous numbers of people coming in. Normally, you wouldn’t do that, but because we’re running a country, we want to keep our country running. So we have a lot of people coming in and out.
Donald Trump: (24:44)
Many of those people, most of those people are tested, depending on what portion of the Oval Office area they’re going in. Everybody coming into the President’s office gets tested, and I felt no vulnerability whatsoever, John. But the two people, as I said, and three people are, they have been tested and it’s negative, and there’ll be probably out of quarantine very quickly. Okay? John?
John: (25:08)
If I can follow up on that, your staff, your senior staff, as you just referenced, is able to get tested every day. When will it be that Americans across the country will be able to get tested every day as they go back to work?
Donald Trump: (25:20)
Very soon. I mean, really very soon. It’s an interesting question, because normally you would have said that you are not tested and you would have been knocking us for not getting tested. So if we get tested, it’s a problem, and if we don’t get tested, it’s a problem. But I like the way your question was phrased better this way, because it is a positive.
Donald Trump: (25:39)
We are tested. We have great capability. You look at all of these machines here. They’re incredible machines, the best anywhere in the world. No place in the world has this kind of equipment. Other countries are calling, sophisticated countries, and they’re calling, lots of countries, and we’re trying to make as much as we can available to them because there’s nothing like what we’ve been able to do in literally a couple of months.
Donald Trump: (26:04)
What they’ve been able to do, the private sector, how they got it done. This is a five to 15-minute test, as an example, the Abbott Laboratories test. These tests are highly sophisticated, very quick, very good. This is things that didn’t even exist a short while ago. So we do have a great testing capability at the White House. We’re doing it, and I think generally speaking, we had a call with the governors the other day, generally speaking, without exception, they were all extremely happy with what’s going on with respect to their testing. Okay?
John: (26:38)
But should people be told to go back to work until they have that assurance that they and their coworkers are able to get a test, which we’re still not there?
Donald Trump: (26:46)
We’re leaving that up to the governors, as you know, and if we see something wrong, we’ll call them out and we’ll stop it, but we are leaving it up to the governors. Some are being not aggressive enough in my opinion, and some are being a little bit aggressive, but they’re being very careful. And the people of the country, they’ve learned a lot over the last two months. They’ve learned about social distancing and washing your hands and other things that we’ve all learned and talked about. They’ve learned about, I see everybody, just about everybody, has a face mask on. They’ve learned about face masks, the good and the bad, by the way. It’s not a one-sided thing, believe it or not.
Donald Trump: (27:20)
But our country has learned. Our country has been incredible. And you see the numbers. They’re dropping very substantially. The numbers are dropping around our country very, very substantially. So we leave that, John, up to the governors, and I think they’re making a lot of good decisions. We’ve had, as I said, a great relationship with governors, Democrat and Republican. And I think overall they’re making very good decisions. Nobody in this group. All the ones behind the rope. That’s interesting. Please.
Press: (27:54)
Thank you, Mr. President. You said it in your comments earlier, “We have met the moment. We have prevailed.” To you, sir, is the mission accomplished, even with 1.4 million …
Donald Trump: (28:02)
No, we’ve prevailed on testing is what I’m referring to. That was with regard to testing. You never prevail when you have 90,000 people, a hundred thousand people, when you have 80,000 people as of today, when you have the kind of death you’re talking about, when you have potentially millions of people throughout the world that are dying, that’s not prevail.
Donald Trump: (28:26)
What I’m talking about is we have a great testing capacity now. It’s getting even better. There’s nobody close to us in the world, and we certainly have done a great job on testing, and testing is a big, is a very big, important function. By the way, some people consider it more important than others, to be honest with you, but testing certainly is a very important function, and we have prevailed. We have the best equipment anywhere in the world. Okay, please. Yeah. Please, go ahead.
Steve: (28:56)
There are a variety of reports that Chinese hackers are attempting to steal technology related to vaccine research. Is this something you’re concerned about? What can you say?
Donald Trump: (29:06)
So what else is new with China? What else is new? Tell me. I’m not happy with China. They should have stopped this at the source. They could have stopped it right at the source. So now you’re telling me their hacking. So I just say this, Steve, what else is new? We’re watching it very closely.
John: (29:25)
If I could follow up, sir. The South China Morning Post, the Beijing newspaper, says that China would like to reopen negotiations on the trade deal to make the terms more favorable to them. Is this something you’d be interested in doing?
Donald Trump: (29:37)
No, not at all. Not even a little bit. No. I’m not interested. We signed a deal. I had heard that too. They’d like to reopen the trade talk to make it a better deal for them. China has been taking advantage of the United States for many, many years, for decades, because we had people at this position right here where I’m standing, sitting right in that office, the Oval Office, that allowed that to happen. No, I’m not interested in that. Let’s see if they live up to the deal that they signed. Okay? Please, go ahead.
Press: (30:11)
Mr. President, what are your thoughts about a second round of direct payments to Americans that’s included in the House Democratic bill?
Donald Trump: (30:18)
Well, we’re talking about that with a lot of different people. I want to see a payroll tax cut, I want to see various things that we want, I want the workers to be taken care of, but we are talking about that. We’re negotiating with the Democrats. We’ll see what happens.
Donald Trump: (30:34)
But as I said, it’s a transition and this is really going to be, in my opinion, we’ll see, but I think it’s going to be something that’s going to be very special. It’s a transition to greatness, and greatness is next year, right from the beginning. I think we’re going to do fantastically well.
Donald Trump: (30:52)
I view the third quarter, as I said, as a transition quarter. Could be pretty good, but a transition quarter. Toward the end of the fourth quarter, you’re going to see some numbers that are going to be tremendous, I think, and next year, you’re going to have potentially the kind of numbers that you saw before and maybe even better because there is that pent-up demand.
Donald Trump: (31:13)
A lot of people wanted to do things. They were ready to do things, and they’ve had to hold back because of the virus. So I think you’re going to have with that pent-up demand, a phenomenal year next year, unless somebody messes it up by coming along and raising taxes, doubling, tripling, quadrupling your taxes, like a certain party, namely, the Democrats want to do, you’ll mess it all up.
Donald Trump: (31:36)
You know, we had the greatest in the world. I presided, this administration presided over it. It got great for a reason and we’ll do it again and we’ll do it again very quickly and very easily. I see that happening. Yes, ma’am. Please.
Press: (31:52)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Almost everyone, as you noted, in the Rose Garden is wearing a mask today. Why haven’t you required everyone at the White House to wear masks before now?
Press: (32:03)
… everyone at the White House to wear masks before now?
Donald Trump: (32:03)
Well, if they’re a certain distance from me, or if they’re a certain distance from each other, they do. In the case of me, I’m not close to anybody. I’d like to be close to these two gentlemen, they’re hardworking, great men, but they just said, “Frankly, let’s keep it this way.” So obviously in my case, I’m very far away from everyone. But if you look at all of those people over there, every one of them, from what I see, these are White House staffers, they’re White House representatives, they’re White House executives, and everybody has a mask on. We’ve had just about everybody I’ve seen today has worn a mask. Yeah.
Press: (32:38)
Were you the one that required that, sir?
Donald Trump: (32:41)
Yeah, I did. I did. I required it. Yes. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 3: (32:44)
Mr. President, you’re now promising that everyone who needs a test will be able to get one at some point soon. Can you give us some figures on what you’re changing to ramp up testing? When will that be a true statement exactly? And how exactly are you going to accomplish that?
Donald Trump: (33:00)
Well, it’s a true statement already. We have more testing than any country in the world by far, but I’ll let Admiral go into a little bit of the future.
Admiral Giroir: (33:11)
When you look at the testing numbers that we worked with collaboratively with the state leadership, it’s not just with the governor, but the state health officers, the state epidemiologists, the public health labs. It’s really a combination of testing those who need something for diagnosis, diagnostic testing, tracing, so testing those who have been around the people with the diagnosis. But the largest fraction of that is really moving into surveillance, that is testing those who are asymptomatic.
Admiral Giroir: (33:39)
And when you do the numbers, this amount of testing on a state to state basis, really is in the range that we need to accomplish all of that, certainly within the range that we need. So it really encompasses those three things. The other thing I would say is, particularly as we move into the summer, there are surveillance mechanisms. And I talked about them before, like a weather radar. And just think about that weather radar. The influenza-like illness network, which is at about 75% of healthcare institutions, and syndromic surveillance. So if we see a blip on that weather radar, combined with CDC personnel in every single state and with contact tracers, we really run to the fire, right? And that’s when you detect, you trace and you shut off that outbreak right when it starts.
Donald Trump: (34:33)
Phil?
Speaker 3: (34:33)
Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (34:33)
Go ahead.
Speaker 3: (34:33)
There does seem to be a double standard here, Mr. President, where members of your own staff can get tests frequently when they need it, but ordinary Americans can not.
Donald Trump: (34:42)
Yeah.
Speaker 3: (34:42)
So when will the rest of America have the same access that members of your own White House have to testing?
Donald Trump: (34:47)
And you know what, if we didn’t get the tests, if we did no tests in the White House, you’d be up complaining, “Why aren’t you getting tests for the White House?” See, we can’t win. Because if we didn’t get the tests, you’d be up… I understand you very, better than you understand yourself. And frankly, if we didn’t get tests done, you’d be up complaining about the fact that we didn’t have the tests done.
Donald Trump: (35:05)
Now that we’re doing so well on tests and so quick and so fast, five minutes, et cetera, and so accurate, you’re complaining that we’re getting too many tests. So you can’t win. Go ahead, Phil.
Phil: (35:17)
Yeah. Mr. President, many Americans want to return to their normal lives, but they’re afraid to do so. How can you ensure Americans that it’s safe to go to their own workplaces when the most secure workplace in the country, the White House, can not contain the spread of the coronavirus, it’s infected some of your own staff?
Donald Trump: (35:34)
Well, when you say some,, so we have a person. And the person, something happened right after a test was done. Three other people met that person, came into relative contact, very little contact, and they’re self-quarantining. That is not exactly not controlling it. I think we’ve controlled it very well. We have hundreds and hundreds of people a day pouring into the White House. It’s a massive office complex, including the very large building right behind us that you know so well.
Donald Trump: (36:04)
So I think we’re really doing a very good job in watching it. And I think it’s very well-contained, actually. And part of the reason, it is because of all the tests we’re able to give, but it was one person and the other people were only people that are quarantined. You understand this field, they’re quarantined for a specific reason. The reason is they were in the general proximity of the one person. And the one person I believe will be fine in a very short period of time.
Phil: (36:28)
Why hasn’t Vice President Pence followed the CDC guidelines of self-isolation, and other people who might have been exposed [crosstalk 00:00:36:36].
Donald Trump: (36:36)
Well, that I’m going to have to ask that he will give you that information. Whatever he is proceeding and doing, he will give you that information. I’ll make sure that they put out a notice. John, go ahead, please.
John: (36:47)
Mr. President, up until now, it’s thought that the most vulnerable people were those above the age of 60, or 70, or 80, and the children were pretty much, I don’t want to say immune from this, but weren’t affected by it. But all day long in the news today, we have been hearing and seeing this terrible syndrome…
Donald Trump: (37:04)
Yeah.
John: (37:05)
… that some 85 children have now. Three of them have died. What is the task force talking about in terms of that, and what could be done about it?
Donald Trump: (37:14)
Yeah. We’re seeing that all over the world now with young children, very, very tiny percentage, but it’s still, it’s the swelling and the skin rash. And we’re looking at that very closely. John. It’s a phenomena that’s just been brought to everyone’s attention a couple of weeks ago. Admiral, you may have something to say about that.
Admiral Giroir: (37:33)
So thank you for pointing that out. And again, I’ve said many times, I’m a pediatrician and a pediatric ICU doctor. This syndrome, which we call, or similar to Kawasaki syndrome. It has been seen in a novel coronavirus before and it’s associated with illnesses. So we have a very strong activation on this. We do no treatments for this, but the CDC is interacting actively with the pediatric intensive care unit network to create case definitions and to understand how this is going. And if there are predispositions.
Admiral Giroir: (38:07)
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, I spoke to Dr. Gary Gibbons, who directs that, who is advancing many research projects based on that. The ASPAR, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, has a team out in several areas, looking at if there are any special treatments. We know what the basic treatment is, but this is a little bit different than we normally see.
Admiral Giroir: (38:30)
So there really is an activation among all the branches within HHS, working with networks at children’s hospitals in ICU nets. It is a small percentage, but it is quite frightening. And this reflects the fact that this virus affects the vasculature. We see clotting, we see strokes. And this is a vasculature phenomenon of inflammation we see in children.
John: (38:53)
Mr. President, with this newly emerging syndrome now among young children, what do you say to parents who would like to get their children back to school, but are now looking at this and potentially afraid to do that?
Donald Trump: (39:05)
Well, again, it’s a tiny percentage, but you’re right. So we’re looking into it very strongly. And the Admiral, as he said, he’s known about this for long before this happened, but it is a very, very small percentage. And people recover from that. The children recover from that, right?
Admiral Giroir: (39:25)
Yes, sir. Most do recover from this, but it is a serious and it can be a fatal condition. So we do want to make sure that parents understand that high fevers, red rashes, particularly in your child, you may need to contact your healthcare provider. There are treatments for this. They work very effectively if gotten early, at least for the vast majority of the cases.
Donald Trump: (39:50)
We’re studying that very closely. And it’s a been on the radar for weeks, actually, because we’ve seen this for quite a while, but it’s been very rare. But we’re, we’re looking at it very closely. It’s very important to us. I think one of the things we’re most proud of is this just came out, deaths per 100,000 people, death. So deaths for 100,000 people, Germany and the United States are at the lowest rung of that ladder. Meaning low is a positive, not a negative. Germany and the United States are the two best in deaths per 100,000 people. Which frankly, to me, that’s perhaps the most important number there is. Please, go in the back, please.
Speaker 4: (40:38)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions. One on the Ahmaud Arbery case and one on the coronavirus. The first on the coronavirus, the Vice President is said to be in some sort of self-isolating, keeping his distance from people. What do you say to Americans who say, “How can you keep me safe? How can you reopen the government if even the vice president is self-isolating?” And why hasn’t testing gotten up to the point where every American who wants to test can get a test?
Donald Trump: (41:07)
Well, the Vice President, first of all, has been tested and he’s negative. And was tested yesterday, tested today. And he’s negative. He’s in very good shape. And I think that that’s going to be fine. As far as Americans getting a test, they should all be able to get a test right now. They should be able to get a test. That’s the problem with a question like that. We go through a whole announcement saying we’re number one in the world by far, by a factor of two and even three and four, depending on where you’re looking. And I get a question. “When will everybody be able to get tested?”
Donald Trump: (41:37)
If somebody wants to be tested right now, they’ll be able to be tested. As far as the incident in Georgia, I think it’s horrible. And it’s certainly being looked at by many people. I’m speaking to many people about it. He looked, I saw the picture of him and his tuxedo, it was so beautiful. He looks like a wonderful young guy would have been a wonderful, just a wonderful guy. I think it’s a horrible thing. I think it’s a horrible thing.
Donald Trump: (42:05)
Now, with that being said, as you know, they’re studying the case very carefully. They’re interviewing everybody involved and we’ll see what happens. To me, it’s a very sad thing. I spoke to a number of people that are very much involved in it. I’ve been following that one very closely. It breaks your heart to watch it. It breaks your heart. And certainly the video was… it was a terrible looking video to me. But you have a lot of people looking at it and hopefully an answer’s going to be arrived at very quickly. But it’s something that is heartbreaking.
Speaker 4: (42:41)
Another question about the case if I could ask it?
Donald Trump: (42:42)
Go ahead.
Speaker 4: (42:43)
The specific question I have is you said that there possibly are things that happened that were not recorded on the tape. Could you expound on what you mean by that and your thoughts on…
Donald Trump: (42:53)
Yeah. Well, I saw the tape and when they moved left, I don’t believe, when they moved left outside of the tape, nobody saw what was going on. It’s an empty spot on the tape. Now do they have additional tapes? I hope, but I will say that it’s something that based on what I saw, doesn’t look good. Somebody that I have a lot of respect for is Senator Scott of South Carolina. You know who I’m talking about? He’s a great gentleman. He’s a great Senator, he’s a great gentleman, Tim Scott. And I called him two days ago. I said, “Tim, what do you think? Tell me, what do you think?” He’s very disturbed by it. He’s very disturbed. And I’m very disturbed, also. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 5: (43:38)
President Trump, thank you. I have two questions. One on testing and one on democratic states that you’ve tweeted about. First, the money for this new testing support today comes from the CARES Act, which you signed into law 42 days ago. Did your delay in embracing widespread testing have anything to do with the desire to suppress the official number of US cases and deaths as you try to reopen the country?
Donald Trump: (44:02)
No, we just wanted to make sure we had the proper machinery, apparatus and everything else out there before people started wasting money. So method of saving money. We wanted to make sure we had even things like this. Plus they have machines that are far more complex than this. They have massive machines at some of the laboratories that can do millions of tests. We wanted to make sure everything was in place. Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 5: (44:26)
And earlier today you tweeted that Democrats are moving slowly for political purposes. Why do you believe that their motive is politics rather than public safety? And how do you respond to criticism that you’re also motivated by politics to try to grow the economy ahead of the election?
Donald Trump: (44:43)
Well, I think that if you look at Pennsylvania, as an example, if you look at various other states, I won’t get into them, the people want to go back. The numbers are getting to a point where they can and there just seems to be no effort on certain blue states to get back into gear and the people aren’t going to stand for it. They want to get back. They’re not going to stand for it. They want our country open. I want our country open too. I wand it open safely, but I want it open.
Donald Trump: (45:11)
Don’t forget, people are dying the other route. You can go with the enclosed route. Everything’s closed up, you’re in your house. You’re not allowed to move. People are dying with that too. You look at drug addiction, you look at suicides, you look at some of the things that are taking place. People are dying that way too. You could make the case it’s in even greater numbers. So it’s a situation that some people, and I’ve noticed that some states could be moving more quickly. And also at the same time, safety. Look, safety is paramount, but people are dying in the lockdown position too. And everybody understands that. They’re just starting to find out. And look at what’s going on with drugs and look at what’s happening with suicides. Yeah, please, please go ahead.
Speaker 6: (45:58)
Hi, Mr. Present. So Americans have been self-quarantining for several months now, social distancing, yet we’re still seeing about 20,000 new cases a day, one to 2000 deaths. Is there anything else the administration is planning to do to get these new cases under control? Because we seem to be on a plateau, or is this [crosstalk 00:14:21].
Donald Trump: (46:20)
Well, excuse me, the numbers are way down from what they were two weeks ago. The numbers are really coming down and very substantially. This weekend was one of the lowest we’ve had. The numbers are coming down very rapidly all throughout the country, By the way, there may be one exception. But all throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly. I think you see that, Admiral.
Speaker 6: (46:43)
Oh yeah. But… Now 130,000 cases that go through August. Do you agree with those models? Is that your expectation as well?
Donald Trump: (46:53)
Well, the models haven’t been exactly accurate. These are models done by a lot of think tanks. A lot of universities. You look at some of the models they’ve been way off. A few of the models have been accurate. But as far as the models are concerned, if you go by the model, we were going to lose 2.2 million people. And because we mitigated, we did things that were very tough for our country to do, frankly. We had to turn off our whole magnificent economy. We had to turn down the whole country. We’re at the lowest of all of the models. If you look at that 100 to 120, 000 people would be at the low side and we’re at… there’s nothing low. Look, nothing low. One is too many people.
Donald Trump: (47:39)
And I say it all the time. One person to lose for this is too many people. It’s a disgrace what happened. But if you look at the models, we’re at the lowest of those projections. But the models are not models done necessarily by the White House, they’re models done by many people all over the world. And if you take the most respected of those people, many of those models are wrong…
Donald Trump: (48:03)
The most respected of those people, many of those models are wrong, I mean, they’ve been wrong as far as the U.S. is concerned because those numbers are nowhere near what was projected, potentially.
Speaker 7: (48:11)
[inaudible 00:48:11] an expectation of what the death toll is going to look like by the summer, by the-
Donald Trump: (48:15)
You know what, I don’t want to think about it even. I know that we’re doing everything we can, we’re doing a good job. We acted very early. We acted extremely early in keeping China out of our country and banning people from China coming in, other than our citizens, which we obviously had to take and they were quarantined or watched carefully, they were tested, they were watched very carefully. But we had about 40,000 people coming in from China, from Asia and we had to obviously take the people. Can you imagine if I said, you’re a U.S. citizen, we’re not going to take you. That doesn’t work. But they were very carefully … I was with Ron DeSantis, he said, literally put the people that came in from China in quarantine for a substantial period of time.
Donald Trump: (48:58)
No, that was a big decision. I think we saved hundreds of thousands of lives by acting very early. And when I did this, I think the Admiral can say it, everybody was against my doing it. Everybody, everybody was. The professionals, the doctors, I was pretty much by myself on that one and it was a lucky thing we did it because we saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 8: (49:26)
Thank you, Mr. President, earlier today, the Vice President urged governors to have all their nursing home residents tested. Why not just mandate that? Why not require that, have you considered that?
Donald Trump: (49:38)
Well, I would certainly consider that. I will mandate it if you’d like I would, I think it’s important to do. And I think frankly, some of the governors were very lax with respect to nursing homes. It was obvious right from the beginning of the state of Washington, where 26 or 28 people died very early on. And I would have said nursing homes and I did say nursing homes. That’s what they should. Now some of the states, many of the states are doing that, but I think all of the states should be, they have the capacity to do it. They should be doing nursing home. That is a real vulnerability.
Speaker 8: (50:14)
The two staffers that were announced last week as testing positive. Are you aware of any additional White House staff?
Donald Trump: (50:22)
No, not at all. I’m only aware of people that saw them were tested. The tests were negative and they’re quarantining anyway. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 9: (50:34)
Thank you Mr. President, I wanted to ask, are you now, or are you considering separating some more with Vice President Pence as a precautionary measure?
Donald Trump: (50:46)
Well, first of all, the job he’s done on task force, the job he has done frankly, as the Vice President of the United States has been outstanding. And he’s a warrior too, just like doctors and nurses, I mean he is working so hard and he’s coming into contact with a lot of people, but again, he tested negative so we have to understand that. But he comes into contact with a lot of people. It’s something probably during this quarantine period we’ll probably talk about. I have not seen him since then, but I would say that he and I will be talking about that. Yeah, we could talk on the phone. Please.
Speaker 9: (51:23)
Admiral Giroir, if I could. The President just said that Dr. Fauci, Dr. Hahn have tested negative. Then why do they need to be isolated? Is there some concern that they could be spreading the virus in some way? Is there a concern about the testing? Why do they need to isolate?
Admiral Giroir: (51:42)
So this is a very fundamental concept and I’m so happy you brought that up because it underlies a lot of the questions here. If you test negative just at that one point, that just means you have tested negative for that point in time. We know that the incubation period for this virus can be many days. So the CDC guidelines really says that if you’re in close contact, just testing negative on that one day doesn’t mean you won’t be positive later on. So the prudent and the recommended thing to do is to self-isolate yourself for the entire period of incubation and really then some. So that’s what they’re doing. It’s a precautionary manner because they were negative. We all hope that they remain negative, but if they turn positive in a day or two or became symptomatic, that’s still possible even with a negative test.
Speaker 9: (52:31)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (52:32)
Go ahead, Bill.
Speaker 10: (52:36)
Mr. President in one of your Mother’s Day tweets, you appear to accuse President Obama of the “biggest political crime in American history by far,” those were your words. What crime exactly are you accusing President Obama of committing? And do you believe the Justice Department should prosecute him?
Donald Trump: (52:52)
Obamagate, it’s been going on for a long time. It’s been going on from before I even got elected and it’s a disgrace that it happened. And if you look at what’s gone on, and if you look at now all of this information that’s being released. And from what I understand, that’s only the beginning. Some terrible things happened and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again. And you’ll be seeing what’s going on over the coming weeks. And I wish you’d write honestly about it, but unfortunately you choose not to do so. Yeah, John, please.
Speaker 10: (53:22)
What is the crime exactly that you’re accusing…?
Donald Trump: (53:24)
You know what the crime is, the crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers except yours. John, please.
Speaker 11: (53:31)
Yeah. Mr. President, if I could just get a clarification on the testing. We’ve seen clearly that the numbers of tests have gone up. There have been some advancements in testing, but you’ve said twice the other day that every American who wants a test can get a test.
Donald Trump: (53:43)
Yes.
Speaker 11: (53:44)
That’s not the case, one point nine million tests per day is far short of every American that wants a test to be able to get a test.
Donald Trump: (53:51)
Well, I going to have the Admiral … but I will say just from listening and hearing like you do, we all do, not should get a test because they have to have certain things. And they’re going to know when they’re not feeling right. Those are the people that will be getting the test, but Admiral, I’ll let you take it from there, please.
Admiral Giroir: (54:07)
So everybody who needs a test can get a test. We have plenty of tests for that [inaudible 00:00:54:14]. Right now in America anybody who needs a test can get a test in America with the numbers we have. If you are symptomatic with a respiratory illness, that is an indication for a test and you can get a test. If you need to be contact traced, you can get a test. And we hope and not hope, we are starting to have asymptomatic surveillance, which is very important. Again, that’s over three million tests per week. That is sufficient for everyone who needs a test, symptomatic, contact tracing, and to our best projections the asymptomatic kind of surveillance we need to get that and that that’s the way it is. And remember, I work at HHS, I work there every day. I don’t get tested every day. I get monitored for my symptoms. Am I febrile? Do I have any other symptoms? I wear a mask when I go in.
Admiral Giroir: (55:07)
That’s a safe work environment for the environment we have. If I became symptomatic, I would get a test. And if it were positive, I would isolate and there’d be contact tracing to stop that just the way it was done here. If I’m not symptomatic, I do the precautions as everyone has recommended in phase one and that’s the essence of safely opening America.
Donald Trump: (55:29)
And John, the numbers are coming way down and they’re coming down rapidly and that’s a beautiful thing to see. And that’s pretty much universally all across the country. They’re coming down very rapidly so very important. Please go ahead.
Speaker 11: (55:41)
[inaudible 00:55:41] the Admiral. So Americans who are going back to work shouldn’t expect and shouldn’t need, shouldn’t want to have the same thing that people coming to work here at the White House have which is the ability to get tested regularly, regardless of symptoms, is that what you’re saying?
Admiral Giroir: (55:57)
Let me clarify as well. People who come into close contact with the President get tested on a regular basis, okay. If I were not in close contact with the President specifically, I would not get tested like most people here do not get tested. That’s a very specific circumstance. When I work at HHS, I go at HHS, I don’t get tested. I do the exact thing that we ask Americans to do to monitor your symptoms. If you are symptomatic, self-isolate, get tested, with one of our community based testing sites, at your hospitals. There are even at home testing now that has been authorized. And to cooperate that if you need to be contact traced, be contact traced and cooperate with your local public health. But not everybody who walks in here gets tested every time they do. If you’re symptomatic here, at HHS, at a meat packing plant, at a school, you need to get tested.
Donald Trump: (56:51)
And the meat packing plants now are doing very well. There’s great testing around those plants. And we’re finding out who had the problem, they’re being quarantined. And the meat packing is moving along very nicely, but they were trouble spots. They were hot zones definitely, please. One thing I think is very important though, John, just to finish, we have now, and nobody says it, they just don’t want to write it, by far more tests than any other country in the world not even a contest. And the quality of our test is the best anywhere in the world. That’s very important to say, please go ahead.
Brad Smith: (57:28)
And to make sure I understand the White House’s position, are you saying that right now, you feel there is enough testing, adequate testing across the United States, or do you feel that it needs to be ramped up? And by how much, if so, does it need to be ramped up?
Admiral Giroir: (57:41)
I think we’ve been clear all along that we believe and the data indicate we have enough testing to do the phase one gradual reopening that has been supported in the President’s plan and the task force plan. And it has to be a phased reopening. Nobody’s saying turn the light switch on and everyone go, because then it would be really impossible to control the spread of the virus. There are many, many models out there. The Rockefeller Foundation published their recommendations of about three million tests per week. That’s exactly what we’re doing. If you look at our agent based models, it’s far below that. If you take the Safra Center at Harvard and correct their misassumptions, like on the sensitivity of the test, the mitigation processes and how many people get hospitalized, you get about that number.
Admiral Giroir: (58:30)
Now I am not going to come here and say, we can absolutely swear it’s God’s truth that this is the number we need, but we know we have enough to open and we’re going to be very careful with our ILINet, with our surveillance programs and what the data come in to inform us even further as we grow and learn. And I think Brad may-
Brad Smith: (58:49)
And let me just add a little bit to that because most days I don’t come to the White House to work, I either go to FEMA or I go to HHS. And let me just talk you through what the protocols are there, because I would never get tested if I wasn’t coming to the White House. So every day when we come in, we get our temperature taken and we get asked questions about if we have symptoms, if you don’t, then you enter the workplace. And then there’s hand sanitizer all over the place. In rooms that are made for conference rooms, they put pieces of paper that say, don’t sit, in essentially every other, every third seat to separate people. And so there’s a lot of precautions that we’re taking in the federal government that are separate from testing. And those are the precautions that the agencies that Admiral Giroir and I are working at every day are using to let us continue working.
Donald Trump: (59:29)
If people want to get tested, they get tested. We have the greatest capacity in the world not even close. If people want to get tested, they get tested. But for the most part, they shouldn’t want to get tested. There’s no reason, they feel good, they don’t have sniffles, they don’t have sore throats. They don’t have any problem. If they do feel there’s something happening, they have the absolute easy. In fact, Ron DeSantis, Florida, the governor is doing a fantastic job in Florida. He said, he’s got a little bit of the opposite problem. He’s got so much testing that people sit around and wait for people to come in. That they have a great overcapacity for testing. And there are numerous other states that have told me the same thing. That’s by the way, a good problem, not a bad problem, okay. Yeah, go ahead please.
Weijia Jiang: (01:00:14)
You’ve said many times that the U.S. is doing far better than any other country when it comes to testing.
Donald Trump: (01:00:22)
Yes.
Weijia Jiang: (01:00:23)
Why does that matter? Why is this a global competition to you if every day Americans are still losing their lives and we’re still seeing more cases every day?
Donald Trump: (01:00:33)
Well, they’re losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that’s a question you should ask China, don’t ask me, ask China that question, okay. When you ask them that question, you may get a very unusual answer. Yes, behind you, please.
Weijia Jiang: (01:00:50)
Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?
Donald Trump: (01:00:53)
I’m telling you.
Weijia Jiang: (01:00:54)
That I should ask China.
Donald Trump: (01:00:54)
I’m not saying it specifically to anybody. I’m saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that.
Weijia Jiang: (01:00:58)
That’s not a nasty question.
Donald Trump: (01:00:59)
Please go ahead.
Weijia Jiang: (01:01:00)
Why does it matter?
Donald Trump: (01:01:01)
Okay, anybody else? Please go ahead in the back please.
Kaitlan Collins: (01:01:08)
I have two questions.
Donald Trump: (01:01:09)
No, it’s okay, we’ll go over here.
Kaitlan Collins: (01:01:09)
But you pointed to me. I have two questions, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:01:09)
Next, next please.
Kaitlan Collins: (01:01:11)
But you called on me.
Donald Trump: (01:01:13)
I did and you didn’t respond and now I’m calling on the young lady in the back, please.
Kaitlan Collins: (01:01:18)
I just wanted to let my colleague finish, but can I ask you a question.
Donald Trump: (01:01:19)
Okay, ladies and gentlemen thank you very much, appreciate it.
Kaitlan Collins: (01:01:23)
But you called on me.
Donald Trump: (01:01:23)
Thank you very much."
"May 5, 2020",2:28 P.M. EDT,"David Muir: (00:00)
I want to start with reopening the country. I know this is your first trip back out into the country …
Donald Trump: (00:05)
Yes.
David Muir: (00:05)
… In Quite some time. And you’ve said that the decision to open the economy is the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make. How do you, and I suppose this is the central question, how do you save livelihoods without risking more lives?
Donald Trump: (00:19)
Well, I think actually the decision to close the country was the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make and I’ve said that very loud and clear. I mean we had the greatest economy in history, in the history of the world, not only our economy, it was our greatest economy, best employment numbers, best numbers in every single way. And they said, sir, we have to close the country. I said, what are you talking about close the country? Because nobody’s ever heard of such a thing. And we saved millions of lives by doing it. And by putting the ban on China very early was a big thing.
Donald Trump: (00:50)
But the biggest decision I’ve ever had to make is closing the country. And certainly this is now also a big decision, but the people want to go back to work.
David Muir: (00:58)
I want to ask you about what Dr. Fauci said last night about the reopening of the country. He said it’s the balance of something that’s a very difficult choice. How many deaths and how much suffering are you willing to accept to get back where you want to be? Do you see it that way? Do you believe that’s the reality we’re facing, that that lives will be lost to reopen the country?
Donald Trump: (01:19)
It’s possible there will be some because you won’t be locked into an apartment or a house or whatever it is. But at the same time, we’re going to practice social distancing. We’re going to be washing hands. We’re going to be doing a lot of the things that we’ve learned to do over the last period of time and we have to get our country back. People are dying the other way too. When you look at what’s happened with drugs, it goes up. When you look at suicides, I mean take a look at what’s going on. People are losing their jobs. We have to bring it back and that’s what we’re doing.
David Muir: (01:51)
Let me ask you about testing …
Donald Trump: (01:52)
Yeah.
David Muir: (01:53)
… Right now in America. Early on there were hurdles. Dr. Fauci at the time acknowledged it was a failing. But for Americans who do want to go back to work, should they be able to have access to a test now? Should they know whether they’ve been exposed to the virus? Should they know if somebody’s at the workplace asymptomatic and they simply don’t know, or do they have to go back to work having faith in their leaders and you, Mr. President, that the workplace will be safe?
Donald Trump: (02:17)
Yeah. No they don’t. They have to test if they want. Some people are strong believers in testing.
David Muir: (02:24)
So right now for any American worker who’s nervous about going back, if they want to get tested to see if they’ve been exposed to the virus, they can have access to both the antibody test …
Donald Trump: (02:33)
They should have not problem. They should have no problem. And as good as this is, we’re even getting better. We came up, don’t forget the cupboard was bare. The other administration, the last administration left us nothing. We didn’t have ventilators. We didn’t have medical equipment. We didn’t have testing. The tests were broken. You saw that. We had broken tests. They left us nothing and we’ve taken it and we have built an incredible stockpile, a stockpile like we’ve never had before.
David Muir: (02:58)
Many people heard you say that along the way, and have wondered though, you’re three years into your first term, you’re now applying for the job again. What did you do when you became president to restock those cupboards that you say were bare?
Donald Trump: (03:10)
Well, I’ll be honest, I have a lot of things going on. We had a lot of people that refuse to allow the country to be successful. They wasted a lot of time on Russia, Russia, Russia. That turned out to be a total hoax. Then they did Ukraine, Ukraine, and that was a total hoax. Then they impeached the president of the United States for absolutely no reason and we even had 197 to nothing vote by the Republicans.
David Muir: (03:36)
Let me ask you about something Governor Cuomo said today, and this is really the debate I think for a lot of Americans who really do want to go back to work …
Donald Trump: (03:44)
Sure.
David Muir: (03:45)
… But who are afraid for their own health. And Governor Cuomo said, the question comes down to how much a human life is worth? That you monitor the transmission rate, the hospitalization rate, the death rate. If it goes up, you stop, you turn off the valve, you slow things down. Do you agree with him that that is the way a lot of these governors who are reopening should proceed?
Donald Trump: (04:04)
No, I don’t know yet. I’d have to see this full statement. Look, we’ve gotten along very well. Don’t forget Governor Cuomo last week said, the president and the federal government have done a phenomenal job. He said that, a phenomenal job.
David Muir: (04:16)
Yeah. He’s saying now that you just have to be ready to turn the valve off for a time if you see a spike.
Donald Trump: (04:21)
David, I can only tell you what he said last week. Our country has to go back to being our country again. You have people that are not going to stand for this and I understand them very well and we are going to put out little embers and little fires and maybe some big fires, but we still have to go back to work.
David Muir: (04:40)
You talk about the embers and the possible big fires. There were two new studies out in the last 24 hours. I know that the White House has shot down a couple of them saying they weren’t vetted through your taskforce. One was from Johns Hopkins that said the death rate could double if we’re not careful with this reopening of America by June, the daily death rate. The University of Washington saying we could have 135,000 Americans dead by August. What do you make of those numbers, Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (05:10)
A couple of things. First of all, these models have been so wrong from day one, both on the low side and the upside. They’ve been so wrong. They’ve been so out of whack and they keep making new models, new models and they’re wrong. Those models that you’re mentioning are talking about without mitigation. Well, we’re mitigating and we’ve learned to mitigate, but we can be in place, work in place, and also mitigate. We’ve done it right, but now we have to get back to work. We have to do it.
David Muir: (05:36)
But let me ask you, because you’ve responded to those two new studies out with these forecasts, your own numbers have shifted over time.
Donald Trump: (05:43)
They have. They have.
David Muir: (05:43)
You said 60,000 Americans could die. That’s what you said last week. I watched her town hall over the weekend. You said 75, 80 to 100,000 people could die. Which models are you looking at and what should Americans be prepared for as reopen the country and head into the fall where we could see a potential second wave?
Donald Trump: (06:01)
Well, the upper number was, as you know, 2.2 million people. And then there were some models or charts that showed higher than that. But 2.2 million people, I always felt 60, 65, 70, as horrible as that is. I mean, you’re talking about filling up Yankee Stadium with death. So I thought it was horrible, but it’s probably going to be somewhat higher than that. There’ll be more death, but the virus will pass with or without a vaccine and I think we’re doing very well in vaccines. But with or without a vaccine, it’s going to pass and we’re going to be back to normal, but it’s been a rough process.
Donald Trump: (06:38)
There’s no question about it.
David Muir: (06:40)
Are you still convinced we’ll have a vaccine by year’s end and 300 million doses, which you had spoke of?
Donald Trump: (06:45)
Yeah. You can never be convinced. When you say, am I convinced, I can say this. We’re doing really great, Oxford, Johnson and Johnson, these companies and I get reports every single day. They’re doing really great. Am I convinced? I can’t be convinced of anything, but I think that we have a really good shot of having something very, very substantial.
David Muir: (07:06)
Let me ask you about the tremendous hurt in this country. There are 30 million Americans who are unemployed. You don’t need me to tell you that. We’re expecting the new unemployment rate this week. There have been forecasts 15, 16, 17%. One of your advisors projected at an unemployment rate of 19%. that’s nearly one in five Americans without a job. How bad is this going to get?
Donald Trump: (07:30)
Well, that is what it is and it’s very interesting. Even the Democrats aren’t blaming me for that. We had to closed it up and we saved millions of lives and we did the right thing. Now we’re getting back to work. The third quarter, I think, is going to be, I call it a transition quarter. A lot of people, you see it. I’ll tell you what. I got on the plane today. There was such spirit. People are starting to feel. We land in Arizona. I leave from DC. I get calls from everybody all over the country. I just spoke to the governor of Florida. Florida is really active.
David Muir: (08:03)
I think a lot of people share that hope, Mr. President, but the reality for so many of the families that we’ve reported on is they can’t afford to wait for the next quarter. They’re just trying to get through next week or the next dinner they put on the table.
Donald Trump: (08:16)
Well, we’ve done a lot for that. We’ve done our small business, as you know, or PPP paycheck, if you want to call it that, where small businesses are given billions of dollars so that they can take care of their employees. We’ve done a lot of other, look, we, we’ve done $2 trillion and it’s actually close to three if you really add it up, but $2 trillion has been approved and we’ll probably do more. It’s a stimulus. It’s to keep people employed, to keep small businesses open.
David Muir: (08:46)
Let me ask you, because people will look back and we have an election six months from now. They’re going to look back to the beginning of this and they’re going to wonder what you knew and when you knew it and I have no interest in going back over everything you said. But there was one thing you said that perhaps you could clarify. You said this, this was at the end of February. A full month had gone by. You’d stop travel from China and you said of the cases here in the US. When you have 15 people and when the 15 within a couple of days is going to go down to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.
David Muir: (09:19)
Help me understand that moment. Did you really think we were going to have 15 cases in the US?
Donald Trump: (09:23)
Let me, I said, even you would say, worse than that. I said one person one time and it’s true. There was a time when we had one person in this country. We knew about it, we worked on it, but we had one person. It mushroomed to 15 people, mushroom. Other people were coming in also from Europe. Don’t forget.
David Muir: (09:43)
But we’re at more than a million cases now.
Donald Trump: (09:44)
But don’t forget, in January. Okay, let’s talk about cases. You know why you’re at a million cases? Because we have more testing than anybody else. If we tested as much as these countries down here, okay, who don’t do very much testing at all. Look at Japan, very little testing there at the bottom of the rung. Look at South Korea gets so much publicity. The president of South Korea is a friend of mine, President Moon. He called up. He said, what you’re doing with testing is amazing. If I tested this number of people instead of this number of people, I’d have far fewer.
Donald Trump: (10:15)
See, this line goes all the way up over seven million tests. If I tested down here at one million tests, I would have a lot fewer cases too.
David Muir: (10:25)
I understand the argument you’re making …
Donald Trump: (10:28)
But look at your question.
David Muir: (10:28)
But you understand there’s a huge disparity between 15 and more than a million cases. Was it an intelligence failure? Where was the breakdown that we didn’t know the scope of this?
Donald Trump: (10:39)
Look, let me tell you this. I closed the border if you want to use that term. I banned people from coming into China. There were approximately 40,000 Americans. If you were in my position, you would let them come in. You could ask Ron DeSantis, great governor of Florida. Those people went through quarantine. They went through tests. They went through everything, but they were American citizens. I had to let them come back in. What I came in and what I did is I said against many people, including Anthony Fauci, who I like very much, including Deborah, who I liked very much, the doctors and many other people, they said, don’t ban China.
Donald Trump: (11:22)
It’s going to blow over, and they said this at the end of February. Now at the same time, I want to be optimistic. I don’t want to be Mr. Gloom and Doom. It’s a very bad subject. I’m not looking to tell the American people when nobody really knows what’s happening yet, this is going to be so tragic. I want to be aside from everything else and I’m going to use a term and some people love it and some people hate it, but I love it. I want to be a cheerleader for our country.
David Muir: (11:51)
When we come back, is president comfortable if the election six months from now becomes a referendum on his handling of the pandemic? What he told me and his message tonight when we asked what he would say to the families who’ve lost loved ones now more than 70,000 lives lost in our country."
"May 5, 2020",5:49 P.M. EDT,"Trump’s Early Press Conference
Second Lady Lizer: (00:00)
Well, it’s, I think it’s just all Indian country, you know, Indian country.
Donald Trump: (00:02)
Indian country.
Second Lady Lizer: (00:03)
Whether it’s Alaska native or Navajo or Hopi or Gila river, it’s all over.
Donald Trump: (00:10)
It’s a very big problem in Alaska. Yeah? Yes.
Myron: (00:13)
Mr. President, if I could add to that, just recently in Farmington, New Mexico, there was an Anglo woman who was abducted and I’m most certain she came across the Navajo nation and was found murdered near Flagstaff, Arizona. And so I think it just speaks largely to the lack of public safety officers in such a vast land, the size of West Virginia.
Donald Trump: (00:33)
It is a vast, yeah, it’s a vast land.
Myron: (00:37)
Not only Navajo and others, but it’s just a area that, I guess, because there’s not as many public safety that you get those [crosstalk 00:00:44].
Donald Trump: (00:46)
I’m going to be signing something in a couple of moments and I hope it helps a lot, not just a little bit, a lot. And I think you’ll do a fantastic job. I know you’re going to be watching it personally and between the three of you and everyone else that I know so well, I think you’re going to do a great job. So go get them.
Second Lady Lizer: (01:01)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:03)
[inaudible 00:01:03] I’d like to maybe finish off with the Governor. Great governor, you’re doing phenomenal job. What do you have to say, Doug?
Governor Ducey: (01:10)
Well my mic, thankfully, is working. First, I want to say thank you, Mr. President. We’re thrilled that you’re back in Arizona, especially to talk these specific tribal issues. I want to say to Second Lady Lizer to Vice President Lizer, to Governor Lewis, this focus that we’ve had on our tribal nations, first and foremost around the coronavirus, with a special shout out to Senator McSally, who advocated for these ventilators that were so needed on Navajo nation, please extend my best to President Nez.
Governor Ducey: (01:46)
I’m so grateful, Mr. President, that you took a personal interest in getting these ventilators to Navajo Nation and I’m proud, Mr. Secretary, in Arizona, our legislature, both Democrat and Republican last year, signed HB 2570. And Second lady Lizer, I want to give a personal thank you to you. This was the bill to address missing and murdered indigenous people, and what we hope to do in Arizona is to reduce and eliminate this scourge that we have on our native nations.
Governor Ducey: (02:21)
In Arizona we have 22 tribal nations, and 75% of the Navajo people reside in the state of Arizona. So that wasn’t a positive thing that we could get done last year. And Governor Lewis, I want to say to you, another positive thing in addition to the HB 2570 that we passed, it was also unanimous, was the drought contingency plan to address Arizona’s water future. You were a real leader on that and for that I’m grateful. Thank you for being here to …
Donald Trump: (02:50)
Well thank you so much.
Governor Ducey: (02:51)
… celebrate these accomplishments, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (02:52)
One of the other accomplishments we have is in Arizona and a lot of other states, we’re building a wall and you’re finally getting what you need. And interestingly, California’s calling because in bordering towns, as you know, in Mexico they have a very big outbreak of the coronavirus, and California’s calling saying, “You got to help us.” Those are not calls that the media knows about, but that’s the facts.
Donald Trump: (03:23)
And in Tijuana, right along the border, they have a tremendous outbreak and we have just completed 172 miles of wall, and it’s real wall, not the kind you were having built over the years that were scoffed at, right? And we’ve done a lot in Arizona and the people letting us know they’re so happy, they’re so thrilled about it.
Donald Trump: (03:47)
It’s made a tremendous difference, and we’ve had one of the best months ever in the history of our country for not having people come in that we don’t want, that we don’t want in our country. We want to have the people that come in the right way. So you see the numbers, the numbers are about the best we’ve ever had in the history of the country. So it’s good, but we’re getting that done. I guess you see, do you see where they’re doing it?
Governor Ducey: (04:11)
Yes.
Donald Trump: (04:12)
It’s a big thing. Up to 172 miles and we’ll have it completed early next year. So it’s been something. Okay, I’m going to sign this. I want to just congratulate you, Myron.
Myron: (04:25)
Yes sir. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (04:25)
I want to congratulate you. Second lady. That’s so fantastic.
Second Lady Lizer: (04:32)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (04:33)
And I want to congratulate you also, because I’ve been in that vicinity and it’s one of the most beautiful places you can imagine. So congratulations very much. Thank you, Steven.
Jim: (05:03)
Mr. President, what are your thoughts on winding down the Coronavirus Taskforce?
Donald Trump: (05:06)
One second, please. One second, please.
Jim: (05:07)
Yes sir. Oh, sorry.
Donald Trump: (05:11)
I want to make sure everybody looks good except me. I’m going to hand this to the Second Lady, okay, if you don’t mind.
Governor Lewis: (05:23)
Mr. President, I want to thank you.
Donald Trump: (05:25)
Go ahead, please. Please, sitting. Go ahead.
Governor Lewis: (05:27)
I’m wearing my red ribbon in remembrance of this significant moment for missing and murdered Native Americans. And again, I want to thank you for making such an announcement today and for signing an important document to commemorate the National Day of Awareness. And I know that your administration also made another very important announcement today regarding the Coronavirus Relief Fund, and thank you for that.
Governor Lewis: (05:53)
And to take a few moments to comment about that as well. I want to thank, of course, Governor Ducey and Senator McSally for advocating and for making sure that this is getting out to Indian country, this much-needed resources as well. So today your administration made a significant impact across Indian country and I want to thank you for getting some of the money out today.
Governor Lewis: (06:20)
I want to thank you also because we need help now, Indian tribes, and can’t wait for that litigation to end before additional payments are made to us from the fund, and if you can, please direct Treasury to make these payments as soon as possible. And three, we need to spread the limited resources currently available as far as we can, and to avoid allocating to a very few tribes and under allocating to most others.
Governor Lewis: (06:48)
This means that you should include a limit or cap on the total funding any one tribe receives, and we need to have flexible guidance to allow us to use the funds that we receive to keep our governments running. Mr. President. And the current fund of $8 billion is going to be woefully inadequate to meet our overall needs, and we really need to work and we will work with Senator McSally and your administration to take this to the next level.
Governor Lewis: (07:16)
I look forward to working with Senator McSally, with your Chief of Staff Meadows, Congress, and your administration on the next relief bill, Mr. President, thank you, to make sure that your investments in Indian country are going where they are needed the most in a way that shows that our governments and our economic entities can be part of that recovery that we are talking about here.
Governor Lewis: (07:39)
That will be critical as we come out of this crisis and rebuild our tribal state and national economy together with Indian country included, Mr. President. I always end my video messages to my community members, “We’re all in this together, and to continue to be Gila River strong.” And I think that is how that we can continue to be Gila River strong and to strengthen all tribal nations moving forward, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (08:04)
Thank you very much, Steven. I appreciate it. I have to say, Myron Lizer and I have dealt and our people have dealt together very closely, and the Second Lady, and a lot of progress has been made and we’ll continue to make a lot of progress. I think you’ll see that, and I think you’re going to see it not only here but in the future. Thank you very much, and I appreciate it very much. Thank you. Governor.
Governor Ducey: (08:26)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (08:27)
And I don’t have to thank you. You’re with the administration. He has good genes, though, you know. He’s got good genes, right? The Scalia genes. You don’t get better than that, do you?
Speaker 7: (08:35)
No, pretty good.
Jim: (08:37)
Mr. President, on winding down the taskforce, Vice President Pence said there are discussions underway about winding down the taskforce. Is that a good idea during a pandemic?
Donald Trump: (08:45)
Well, I think we’re looking at phase two and we’re looking at other phases. The country’s starting to open up. The taskforce has done a phenomenal job. We have a chart that I just showed somebody. We just got it this morning as I was getting off the plane. Governor Ducey can explain it better than anybody. When we came in, ventilators were a very, very big deal and very hard to produce.
Donald Trump: (09:10)
I say, but it is largely true, the complexity is sort of like building a car. We opened up operations all over the country to build them and there hasn’t been one person that needed a ventilator that didn’t get it, which is amazing and now we’re helping other countries and we’re stockpiling in case some tragedy like this happens again.
Donald Trump: (09:30)
But this just came out on testing, because I think we are at the point or maybe we’ll soon be at the point where I can say the exact same thing on testing. These numbers we just released and this is the United States, the amount of testing, and our level of testing and the quality of testing. This is just from Abbott Laboratories. You know what this one is, Jim. It’s a five-minute test.
Donald Trump: (09:55)
It’s a great test. It’s something people like because you don’t have to go through a laboratory. Send it in and send it back, and it takes a couple of days if they do a good job. So this is the testing, and the line here is United States. We’re over 7 million tests. Germany is at two and a half. Italy is less than that. Japan is down here and South Korea, which we talk about, and again, I’m very friendly with South Korea, and with the president of South Korea, and he calls to congratulate us on our great testing. South Korea is over here.
Donald Trump: (10:28)
One of the reasons we have more cases than any other country by far is because we test much more. So if you test, you’re going to have more cases. If we tested down here, we wouldn’t have very many cases. They like to say we have more cases than anybody, but the fact is when you look at these numbers, and this is the official count, now I can’t tell you whether or not other countries are giving us the straight deal, but I can say that I know one thing, it’s only going to be on the high side, not going to be on the low side.
Donald Trump: (10:58)
So this is the other countries. These are the United States and it’s incredible. Remember this, and I think it’s important to say this, Jim, the quality of our test is also the best. I mean, it’s acknowledged to be the best. So again, when we have cases, and we have more cases than anybody else, does anybody really believe that we have more cases than China, but they don’t talk about numbers like this and other countries. But we report everything and …
Jim: (11:25)
But don’t you want to hear from the experts?
Donald Trump: (11:26)
… I just want to say that we’ve done an incredible job on testing. With that being said, we have some additional, including antibody tests coming out, that will even blow these numbers away, but nobody’s done the job we’ve done. Go ahead.
Jim: (11:39)
But don’t you need to continue to meet with the task force to get the scientific expertise on this pandemic?
Donald Trump: (11:47)
We will have certain people, as an example, we have hospitals that we built, we have medical centers that we built, we have people on the taskforce that focused on that. We have people on the taskforce that’s focused exclusively on ventilators. Well, we have more ventilators now than anybody in the world, and we’re helping France, as you know, we’re helping France, Italy, Spain, Nigeria. We’re giving, I think, 250 to Nigeria.
Donald Trump: (12:13)
We have many countries that we’re helping, but the ventilator problem is solved, so you don’t need that. Now we’re different. It’s sort of a combination of safety and reopening, so we’ll have something in a different form, but the taskforce for what we’ve done, I think everybody out there when they’re being very honest, I think the job we’ve done on testing will shortly be, and maybe even supersede, the job that we’ve done on ventilators, which people can’t even believe.
Donald Trump: (12:42)
We had a call the other day with the governors, Mike Pence took the call, and they had, I believe, all 50 governors, and it was, they say, the best call we’ve had thus far. We’re working closely with the governors. They have everything they need and if they don’t have it and if they don’t need it or if they can’t get it locally, then they know that we are stocked and we are ready.
Donald Trump: (13:04)
As an example, we won’t need this, but we were ready for weeks. We had 10,000 ventilators sitting in various locations with people by the ventilators ready to have those ventilators roll if they needed them in, as an example, Detroit or various other places over the country. So I think that as far as the taskforce, Mike Pence and the taskforce have done a great job, but we’re now looking at a little bit of a different form and that form is safety and opening and we’ll have a different group probably set up for then.
Jim: (13:38)
Are you saying mission accomplished?
Donald Trump: (13:40)
No. No, not at all. Their mission accomplished is when it’s over. When it’s over, Jim, mission accomplished. No, I wouldn’t just say that at all.
Jim: (13:47)
Are you certain you’ll get the advice you need, sir.
Donald Trump: (13:48)
What?
Jim: (13:49)
Are you certain, you will get the advice you need health-wise, in a sense?
Donald Trump: (13:54)
What does that mean? Go ahead. Repeat your question. Say it.
Jim: (13:57)
Are you saying you’ll get the advice that you need in terms of [crosstalk 00:14:00]?
Donald Trump: (13:59)
We have great advice. We have great people. We have great people. Yeah, we have great doctors, we have great medical people, laboratory people. I have to say, I think tremendous progress is being made on vaccines, which everybody should be very happy to hear, and therapeutically I think we’re making very good progress too. We’re making tremendous progress. We have the greatest doctors in the world, the greatest laboratories in the world.
Donald Trump: (14:30)
I think therapeutically, and also from the standpoint of laboratories, laboratories as it pertains to vaccines, we’re doing very well. I’d love to see a therapeutic answer even before the vaccine, because we could take care of people that have a current problem or dilemma. But therapeutically and for the vaccines, a tremendous amount of progress.
Donald Trump: (14:55)
Oxford, Johnson and Johnson, incredible places. … doing, I think, a really good job and they’re very advanced, but we have to now see. … and whoever gets it first, my hats off to them. We’re not looking for first, second, or third. We’re looking to get a vaccine that works and progress has been made.
Press: (15:27)
Mr. President, just to follow up on Jim’s question, with the doctors saying that there might be a recurrence of coronavirus in the fall, can you just explain why is now the time to wind down that taskforce?
Donald Trump: (15:40)
Well, because we can’t keep our country closed for the next five years. You can say there might be a recurrence and there might be, and most doctors, or some doctors say that it will happen and it’ll be a flame and we’re going to put the flame out. We’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about the coronavirus. We’ve learned a lot about this hidden enemy. It’s a dangerous enemy, it’s a bad enemy.
Donald Trump: (16:03)
You see what it does, especially for people over a certain age and people that have an infirmity. If you have diabetes, if you have a bad heart, if you have a certain problem, it just, Myron, it just goes after you. It’s vicious. And we’re saying that people that are over 60, 65 but over 60 we’re even saying, sort of stay back for a while. We recommend you staying back for a while.
Donald Trump: (16:29)
At the same time with young children and children we’d like to see the schools open early next season and on time. It’s very unique how the children aren’t affected but people that have problems and older people can be very badly hurt, injured, or die from this problem.
Press: (16:53)
Hold on. I just want to finish the follow up. I understand you don’t want to keep the country closed for five years, but don’t you want your advisors to keep looking at this closely the way you have in the last few months?
Donald Trump: (17:01)
Well they are looking at it very closely. They are looking at it very closely and I just said it today, I used the word for the first time, I think, in terms of what we’re doing, I’m viewing our great citizens of this country to a certain extent and to a large extent as warriors. They’re warriors. We can’t keep our country closed. We have to open our country.
Donald Trump: (17:25)
Somebody said, “Oh, we could keep it for the next 18 months, we could keep it for the next two years.” Doug Ducey’s done an incredible job as the governor of Arizona. The people aren’t going to accept it. They won’t accept it, and they shouldn’t accept it. We have a great country. We can’t keep it closed. I mean, I’ve had doctors say, “Well, why don’t we close it for a couple of years?”
Donald Trump: (17:46)
This is the United States of America. I created, with a lot of other very talented people and the people of our country, the greatest economy in the history of the world, the greatest that we’ve ever had, the greatest employment numbers, the best numbers we’ve ever had, the best stock markets. I think we had 144 days of record stock markets, and then one day they said, “We have to close our country.”
Donald Trump: (18:11)
Well now it’s time to open it up. And you know what? The people of our country are warriors and I’m looking at it. I’m not saying anything is perfect and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes, but we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon. Maybe I could ask, Doug, if you’d like to address that point?
Governor Ducey: (18:32)
Well, I just want to say, in Arizona, we have put public health first. We have looked at the numbers that your medical experts put forward in the Opening Up America Again plan, in terms of our symptoms, our cases, our hospital capacity, our ability to surge on our testing. We’re going to continue to put public health first, but we know so much more today than we did six or eight weeks ago.
Governor Ducey: (19:02)
So we believe that we want to protect our most vulnerable. Those are the folks that are of a certain age with the underlying health condition. But the first objective was that the largest places were shut down. Major League Baseball made the decision to shut down spring training. Those are some of the best weeks of the year in the state of Arizona. Major League Baseball has delayed opening day. Schools … capacity if it’s necessary. Today, it doesn’t look as it will be.
Governor Ducey: (19:42)
So we have our arms around the public health emergency in Arizona and the President, the Vice President, and the medical experts, along with the cabinet secretaries, have given the latitude to governors to make decisions on what’s in the best public health interest of their state. Arizona is not New York state. It wasn’t hit first. It wasn’t hit that hard. We’ve learned a lot from what those states have gone through and we’re going to apply it to protect our citizens.
Press: (20:11)
Mr. President, do you still want the advice of Drs. Fauci had Dr. Birx? Will be still be involved even once the taskforce is disbanded?
Donald Trump: (20:18)
Oh, sure. Yeah, they will be and so will other doctors and so will other experts in the field, but we’ve learned a lot. As Doug said, we’ve learned a lot. You could probably have fires here, Doug. You’ll put them out. You’re going to put them out and you’ll put them out fast. So yeah, we were bringing our country back and I think what is going to happen, and just said it a little while ago, you’re going to have a third quarter where you’re going to have transitions. You’ll a big, beautiful, hopefully, a very good transition, a very successful transition back into the real world.
Donald Trump: (20:53)
And then you’re going to have a fourth quarter that I think is going to do very well. And then I think next year I think we’re going to have one of the best years we’ve ever had because we have stimulus and we have a pent-up demand like I have never seen before. Today’s a very interesting day because it’s my first day out, and Doug reminded me of something. I didn’t do it for that reason, but you said, “This is the first place you stopped when you ran,” when I ran for something that turned out to be a very successful run.
Donald Trump: (21:21)
We had tremendous crowds, you remember at the convention center, in Phoenix and it was pretty incredible. I didn’t do it for that reason, interestingly, but here we are and it was great that you remind us of that fact. But look, we’re going to have a very interesting transition period into the fourth quarter. I think your fourth quarter is going to be very good and I think next year is going to be one of the best years economically we’ve ever had.
Donald Trump: (21:47)
With that said, for those people that have lost somebody, for the people that have lost a loved one, even a close friend, nothing can ever happen that’s going to replace that. I don’t care what kind of a year you have from an economic standpoint, nobody’s ever going to replace that. But I think from an economic standpoint, purely an economic standpoint, I think next year’s potentially going to be one of the best years we’ve had.
Donald Trump: (22:13)
There’s tremendous stimulus out there and people want to get out. They want to go and they want to go to town. This country was founded on certain principles and those principles are at work like you’ve never seen before. So I want to thank you all very much. Thank you. And we’ll see you perhaps at the next stop. Thank you.
Speaker 8: (22:30)
Thank you you guys.
Jim: (22:33)
Hey, Mr. President. If there’s a vaccine, will you take one? Will you get it? If there’s a vaccine, will you get it, coronavirus vaccine?
Donald Trump: (22:40)
What about it?
Jim: (22:40)
If there’s a coronavirus vaccine, will you get it? Will you take it?
Donald Trump: (22:46)
Will I take it?
Jim: (22:46)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (22:47)
If they would like me to, I’d go the first one or I’d go the last one. I don’t want to waste it, but he’s just saying, if there’s a vaccine, would you take it? And she might like it that it didn’t work too well, okay? But that’s okay. I would absolutely, Jim. If there’s a vaccine and if they wanted me to be first on line, I’d be first on line, or it’d be last on line, or I wouldn’t take it at all. Whatever’s best for the country. Thanks guys. Okay? Thank you.
 Trump’s Afternoon Speech
Donald Trump: (00:00)
In the fantastic state of Arizona. I love Arizona. With the incredible…I had some good moments here, especially on election day. It was a good moment, right? But they’re incredible patriotic and hardworking men and women of Honeywell. Moments ago we saw the brand new production lines where you’re making high quality N95 respirators and they are made to perfection, there’s no bad masks like various countries have been sent some very bad mass from other places. There’s nothing like that at Honeywell. Respirators are there to protect our heroic doctors and nurses as they fight the unseen enemy. More than 150 Honeywell employees are working around the clock. Three shifts a day, six days a week. You are the greatest industrial, and think of this, what you’ve done, you’re part of this incredible industrial mobilization. The biggest since World War II, hard to believe for an invisible enemy, but it’s a vicious enemy. Smart enemy.
Donald Trump: (01:10)
Like generations of Patriots before you, the workers of this factory are pouring their heart in this all in their blood into defending our nation and keeping our people healthy and safe. You make America proud. We really do and I want to thank you very much. That’s why I’m here. I want to thank also the entire leadership team at Honeywell, including Darius, who’s, again, fantastic man and Madden, Mike Mattson, John Waldron, Jim Carroll, Brian Roddick, William Lang, Tony Stallings, and Ramina Canon Shaw. In normal times, it would take nine months to stand up one facility like this, but Honeywell has built this in less than five weeks, creating 500 new jobs in Arizona and another 500 jobs in Rhode Island. Together, these new factories will student produced more than 20 million N95 respirators every single month. A truly miraculous achievement. We’re grateful to be joined by secretary of labor, Jean Scalia and governor Doug Doosey. What a fantastic governor he is. Where is Doug? Where is Doug? Thank you Doug. Doing a fantastic job.
Donald Trump: (02:39)
He already won his election by like 17 points, so I don’t have to praise him too much, but I will say that he has been a fantastic governor, and that’s … People recognize it. That’s why he had what they say is a walk. It’s very good. We’re proud of you. Doug and anything we can do, you’re going to call me. We don’t have to worry about, he calls me plenty. He calls me plenty because he’s doing his job, but I want to thank you both, and Jean, the job you’re doing is fantastic. Thank you both very much. We appreciate it. Thank you Jean.
Donald Trump: (03:13)
I also want to express my appreciation to Senator Martha McSally. Fantastic person. Fantastic person. She’s fighting to uncover the full truth about the China situation and how the World Health Organization handled the outbreak and what happened. There must be transparency and accountability. Martha’s also somebody that is bringing tremendous amounts of dollars back to her state that she loves so much, the state of Arizona, and I know the governor appreciates it very much, Martha, and I appreciate it very much too. You’re doing a fantastic job in good luck. Good luck. Thank you. As well to Betty and Jorge Revis at Sammie’s Mexican Grill in Catalina. Where are they? They’re around here someplace. They’re great.
Donald Trump: (04:08)
Where’s the … Come on up here. Come on up here. Come on. Say a couple of words. Say these people … I saw them on television, I saw them on television. They were being devastated by what happened. And I put out a simple tweet saying what wonderful people they are. And they became very rich. They had lines that went around the block. Say a few words, please. Come on. There’s a mic right over here. I can’t believe I have to socially distance myself from these two people. They’re probably the ones that want it from me. Please say a few words.
Speaker 2: (04:50)
Mister president, we thank you very much. I think you’re doing a great job. I think we represent a lot of the Latino community that is very proud of the job that you’re doing. And I think most of us, all of us, all the Latinos are going to vote for you because we think you’re doing, like I said, a very good job. And I thank you for all the support that you’ve given us. And my wife and I are very happy. And what else can I say? Thank you.
Donald Trump: (05:21)
I really appreciate it. That’s brilliant. That’s beautiful. Go ahead. You can pull that down.
Speaker 3: (05:33)
[foreign language 00:05:38]. Latinos love Trump.
Donald Trump: (05:46)
Wow, that’s great. Thank you. That’s fantastic. So today they took care of 150 health care workers at Davon Gables Assisted Living Facility in Tucson and they’ve been helping a lot of the people here get some good food and they’re sending Donald Trump the bill. I can’t write it off to the government because they wouldn’t like that, but we’re paying for it. So make sure you get me that bill. But we have … They are just two terrific people. Again, I saw them on television and they were having a rough time and now they’re doing great. Everybody knows who they are and they have lines of people wanting to get in. Food is supposed to be fantastic. To defeat the virus, we are harnessing the unrivaled power of American industry. We’re using the Defense Production Act to manufacture over 100,000 additional ventilators on top of our fast growing national supply. We’ve mobilized our country. Ventilators are very hard to make, very complex, big, very expensive.
Donald Trump: (06:49)
We are now at a point where everybody in this country that’s dated a ventilator, right Doug? Has gotten one, especially here in Arizona, everywhere. And Doug’s had some extra ones and he sent them to other places where they needed some help. But we have gotten ventilators to everybody and now we’re actually helping other nations and we’re using them for stockpiles in case this horror show ever happens again, but not a single American who’s needed it. I mean, I’m so proud of that. Because when people, when we started, we started with, I use the expression the cupboards were bare. That means ventilators, that means a lot of other things. So we’re doing something very dramatic and there’s never been … There hasn’t been anything like what we’ve done since a mobilization since World War II. We’ve dramatically accelerated development of new therapies and potential vaccines.
Donald Trump: (07:41)
Johnson and Johnson, Oxford, great places, and we have 90 clinical trials underway and hundreds more on the way and something’s going to happen. Tremendous progress is being made. I don’t want to talk about it until it’s there. We don’t want to talk too soon, but I will say, Doug, they really are. They’re really … Darius, they’re really making progress. You know some of the companies that great companies, you know the Johnson and Johnson folks that have been really fantastic, they want to get to it fast, so we’ll see how it all comes out and we’ll all know very soon and I think it’s going to be a very positive event. Through FEMA, HHS, and our private sector partners we’re equipping our frontline medical workers with more than 70 million N95 respirators, 112 million surgical masks, seven million face shields, 18 million gowns, and nearly one billion gloves.
Donald Trump: (08:40)
Today we hear from a few of Honeywell’s extraordinary workers who are leading the charge to equip our healthcare heroes and Marshall are manufacturing Mike. That’s what it is. It’s a manufacturing might that we haven’t seen for a long time. Bruno Aguina worked at another company for 22 years, but he jumped at the chance to support America and America’s war against the virus right here at Honeywell. He’s wanted to work at Honeywell always, and he had his chance. Now is a first shift team leader. Bruno, please come up and say a few words. Bruno? Thanks Bruno.
Bruno: (09:43)
First off, we want to say thank you, mister president from the Aguina family. Folks, so I’m here today to just kind of let you know a little bit of my background and the company that I left to support the N95 masks and the fight against COVID-19 with Honeywell. I was employed with Boeing for 22 years out in California, relocated out here in Arizona, got a little chance to work with the folks out in Boeing Mesa on the Apache helicopter as well. It’s when I resigned with the Boeing company after so many years to be a part of the Honeywell team. Here at the Honeywell team, they treat you right. It’s a great culture. Great people. Mister president, God bless America. All right. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (10:33)
Thank you Bruno. Great job. Thank you very much, Bruno. And the next time I’m here I think we’ll be … We’ll shake hands and we’ll hug each other for the job he’s doing. Okay, Bruno? Thank you very much. Ursula Warner is a proud air force veteran who courageously served our nation in Afghanistan and all around the world. Now she is continuing her legacy of service right here in Phoenix. Ursula, please come up and tell us how you chose Honeywell and why did you do that.
Ursala Warner: (11:05)
Good afternoon. My name is Ursula Warner. I am an operations supervisor here at Honeywell for the N95 site. I have spent 20 years … Over 20 years serving our country in the United States Air Force. Of those 20 years, I spent 15 years in leadership and management positions like the president said. I served a tour and Afghanistan and a couple of tours in Iraq and was highlighted by the United States Department of Army and Air Force for that. I just retired this past March and I actually had a different plan, but after my retirement ceremony and I saw that this site, the N95 site was standing up and what the purpose of it was, for the first responders and our medical personnel on the front lines, I decided I wanted to be a part of that, a part of something bigger, to continue to serve this country in a different facet. I’d just like to thank the leadership and also Honeywell for the opportunity to provide different jobs and things like that for the people in Phoenix and also me specifically the opportunity to continue to serve my country on a bigger aspect. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (12:51)
She was retired for about two days. Retired? Look how young you are. Retired. Thank you very much. Great job Ursula. Eric Parks is a Marine Corps veteran and the operations manager at Honeywell’s new facility. This is a highly personal mission for Eric. His mother is a nurse. His mother-in-law’s a nurse, his brother is a paramedic and his daughter is about to start our first year of medical school at the University of Arizona. That’s one of the great schools. Eric, please come up. Please. Thank you.
Eric Parks: (13:48)
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. My name is Eric Parks and like Mr. Trump said, I am the operations manager here at this facility. First and foremost, I’d like to thank Mr. Trump for giving this nation the resources, leadership, and guidance that we’ve needed to navigate through these unprecedented times. Thank you. Thank you very much. Secondly and more personally to me, I want to thank Honeywell for giving me the opportunity to serve my country again. It fills me with pride to know that the masks that we are going to be producing off of this facility are going to go to first line responders to help them combat the war against COVID-19.
Eric Parks: (14:24)
Like Mr. Trump said, this is very personal for me. My mother is a nurse. My mother-in-law’s a nurse. My brother is a combat veteran and a paramedic in Tucson and my daughter has decided that she too is going to carry forward the family tradition of serving. The black shirts that the team down here is wearing says the future is what you make it and I am very honored to be a part of the team that is going to make the future safer, not only for my family but for many as well. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (14:53)
Thank you. As you know, this terrible plague has inflicted grave hardships on our people. We mourn for every life lost. We pray for every victim and we shoulder this burden together as one people, one family and one great American nation. Thanks to the profound commitment of our citizens, we’ve flattened the curve and countless American lives have been saved. Our country is now in the next stage of the battle, a very safe, phased and gradual reopening, so reopening of our country. Who would have ever thought we were going to be saying that? A reopening, reopening. One day they came to us and they said, “Sir, we’re going to have to close it down.” We had the greatest economy in history. Darius tell you about that. Greatest economy we’ve ever had, best employment numbers, history of our country, best stock market in the history of our country, most number of jobs, almost 160 million jobs.
Donald Trump: (16:09)
We were never even close to that and they said, “Sir, we have to close it down.” It’s a terrible thing, but we did what was right and now we’re reopening our country and it’s going to be something very special. I was saying before that we’re going to have a transition period. Third quarter, it’s going to transition. Fourth quarter is going to be very good. We think very good and I think next year we’re going to have one of the strongest years we’ve had in a long time, and that’s my ambition to get it back to not only where it was, but to beyond where it was, and I just want to thank all of the people at this incredible company and this incredible plant. This pandemic has underscored the vital importance of reshoring our supply chains and constructing a powerful domestic manufacturing base. I’ve been talking about that for a long time.
Donald Trump: (17:06)
Oftentimes you’d see a plant like this in a different country doing the work you could be doing and you’ll do it better. The United States declared its independence nearly 250 years ago, but in recent decades, Washington politicians allowed our independence to be offshored, outsourced, and seated to foreign countries, but we’re taking it back and we’ve been taking it back. Then you look at our job numbers, you knew that we were taking it back. When we got up to almost 160 million something had to be happening. One of the things that happened was we were taking it back.
Donald Trump: (17:43)
We know it matters where something is made and we want essential medicine supplies and equipment to be manufactured, produced, and made right here in the good old USA. My administration believes in two simple rules. Buy American and hire American. In the 20th century, Honeywell workers helped make America the world’s greatest manufacturing super power. It is a great company and it played a very big role. Now in the 21st century right here in Phoenix, Arizona, you’re reclaiming the noble heritage and writing the next chapter of this incredible American story, and you have a great governor to lead your way and you have a great Senator to lead your away.
Donald Trump: (18:33)
You have a lot of people that are leading your way. It was the men and women of Honeywell whose craftsmanship made it possible for Charles Lindbergh to fly across the Atlantic and for Amelia Earhart to break boundaries in the sky. It was the men and women of Honeywell who built the periscopes, mortar sites and autopilot systems that powered American warriors as they battle the forces of tyranny and fought to victory in the second world war, and it was the unstoppable workers right here at Honeywell that helped our brave astronauts plant our American flag on the face of the moon, and we’re getting ready to do it again, but we’re really using the moon as a landing pad for its journey and our journey together to Mars that’s happening very soon. Now it is one more time for the men and women of Honeywell who are supplying the weapons, the armor, the sweat, and the skill in a war to defeat the new invisible enemy. A tough enemy, a smart enemy, but nobody’s like us and nobody’s tough like us.
Donald Trump: (19:46)
I said it before and I’ll say it again. The people of our country are warriors. With your help, we will vanquish the virus and build a future of greatness and glory with American heart, American hands, American pride, and American soul. Thank you very much for the incredible job you do. Thank you to Honeywell, to our Senator, to our governor. Thank you so much for the incredible job you do and thank you to the people of Arizona. We will never forget. Thank you very much. Thank you."
"May 1, 2020",3:30 P.M.  EDT,"Speaker 1: (00:04)
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
Donald Trump: (00:12)
Thank you. Thank you very much. It’s a great honor to have you all. I know your stories. I got to read about your stories. In some cases, I knew your story without having to read about it from Staten Island, so thank you all very much. Great honor to have you. This afternoon, we’re going to recognize several individuals who have responded to the invisible enemy with courage, determination, and grace. Terrific people. In recent weeks, our nation has endured extraordinary hardships and loss and we mourn with one heart for every life that’s been taken from us. In the midst of so much pain, the heroes we honor today are a true source of inspiration for us all. You really are a very great inspiration for us all and the whole country is watching. With us today is Kyle West from Cincinnati, Ohio. Kyle is 23 years old and he’s proud to be a mailman in his hometown. I know Cincinnati very well. I actually worked in Cincinnati and it was great. The queen city.
Donald Trump: (01:17)
I had a great experience. Many of the people in this route are older Americans in a low-income area, and as Kyle says of his job, “We’re not just mailman. We’re mechanics, movers, and many other things. We’re part of the neighborhood.” That’s true, isn’t that for a mailman? Kyle talks to roughly 500 of his customers each day, bringing a cheerful smile and a listening ear to every parcel of mail. When the pandemic kit Kyle delivered a note to hundreds of older Americans on his route. It said, “If you are at risk and need help getting essential items, let me know. I will do what I can to help.” That means you get it done, right? That’s what he means. Sincerely, mailman Kyle. Since then, Kyle has received more than 400 responses and he’s delivered vital groceries to dozens of senior citizens. Kyle, your love for your neighbors lifts us and the entire nation. Would you come up and say a few words please? Thank you, Kyle. It’s terrific. I’ll move that down for you.
Kyle West: (02:26)
Thank you, Mr. President. I’m greatly honored to be here to represent my fellow postal employees as we continue to provide our essential services to America. Customers often tell us during difficult times that seeing us out every day gives them a sense of normalcy in their life. The gratitude we are receiving from our customers is greatly inspiring and the thank-you notes along our routes are helping us get through. We’re delivering a lot of essential items at this time. The amount of medicine has greatly increased. Customers depend on us for social security checks and other financial information. Since this material mail-in ballots and then essential items that they’re ordering online. At the postal service, we’re continuing to follow CDC guidelines to keep ourselves and our customers safe. Social distancing, wearing a face mask, lots of hand washing, and the cleaning of our vehicles and facilities. I’m very proud to work for the postal service and to deliver for our country.
Donald Trump: (03:53)
Great job. Thank you very much, Kyle. Also, with us are Libby Bish and Raphael Melo and they’re real estate agents in Northern Virginia. Great business, real estate. When one of their clients told them that his restaurant had been hit hard, Libby and Rafael decided they wanted to do something to help. They began raising money to buy food from restaurants to donate to local hospitals. Within a few weeks they’ve raised over $6,000, made 18 deliveries, and fed over 500 healthcare workers and Libby and Raphael please, I’d like to thank you and acknowledge you by having you step forward and say a few words, please. Please.
Rafael Melo: (04:37)
Thank you, Mr. President. Kind of covered it all for us already. So, we are real estate agents in the D.C. area and this mission really came about after receiving a phone call from some of our clients who work in the food and beverage industry here. They gave us some insight on COVID-19, the impact that it had on their business, and from there we just felt compelled to act. So, we started a Go Fund Me campaign to give them some additional business, took money, ordered catering directly from their restaurant, and we dropped it off with different staff working at various hospitals around the area, tirelessly obviously. The campaign started picking up, so we started doing more donations and we kept dropping off. We also increased our goal, but we kept dropping off at different hospitals around the area. So, another really cool factor that we did to sprinkle that to sprinkle in with this was we started compiling videos of some of our contributors expressing their gratitude and those videos were being sent along with the food drop-offs. Let me get you right.
Libby Bish: (05:48)
Some assistance with it. So, Mr. President already addressed most of this, but we named our campaign frontline fuel. We raised over $6,000, helped over 18 local businesses, and delivered meals to nurses and doctors in the area, over 500 nurses and doctors. We also partnered with a local boutique company that produces hand sanitizer, defy ascetic, to include in our drop-offs as an added bonus. Our mission is simple. We want to help local business while also encouraging and helping healthcare workers who are selflessly working around the clock to ensure the health of our people. Thank you, Mr. President for this opportunity. It’s an honor to be here today.
Donald Trump: (06:29)
Thanks very much. Great job. Tall guy, right? So, how tall are you?
Rafael Melo: (06:39)
6’8″.
Donald Trump: (06:39)
6’8″. That’s a good height. I have a son that looks like he’s going to be right around that number. Barron, right? He’s going to be up there. That’s really good. Thank you very much and thank you Libby very much. Today we also honor TJ Kim, a high school sophomore from McLean, Virginia. TJ hopes to serve as a pilot in the United States Navy. At just 16 years old, 16, boy, that’s a great age. TJ is already taking flight classes to get his pilot’s license. When he heard that hospitals needed more personal protective equipment, he launched his own mission, Operation SOS, which stands for Supplies Over the Skies.
Donald Trump: (07:21)
He worked with his school, church, and community to collect medical supplies with the help of the flight instructor who probably was a very good person. What do you think? Pretty good. Good flight instructor too? Knows how to fly right? Pretty good. You better take lessons from somebody that knows how to fly, but who also joins us today and TJ has flown and delivered more than 10,000 pieces of personal protective equipment. That’s a lot of work. That’s a lot of flying too. That’s great. And there can be no better preparation for flying the military planes. I think it can be nothing better, but you’re going to four rural hospitals in Virginia, so TJ, come on up and say a few words. Please. It’d be an honor. Thank you.
TJ Kim: (08:13)
Thank you, Mr. President. I’m beyond humbled to be here today. My name is TJ Kim and I’m a sophomore at the Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland. A little over a month ago, I turned 16 when, due to Coronavirus, my school year and my lacrosse season were effectively over. All I had left was my flight training. Ever since I was nine, it’s been my dream to attend the Naval Academy and become a fighter pilot in the Navy, so I talked to my dad about ways that I could continue my flight training while serving the community at the same time. We came up with operation SOS, meaning Supplies Over the Skies. In my home state of Virginia, I found that there are seven critical access hospitals serving the rural communities around them and I realized that while every hospital is hurting for tier one PPEs, it was the rural hospitals that were often forgotten about, so I wanted to do something to help and bless them.
TJ Kim: (09:02)
I’ve flown four Operation SOS missions so far to Luray Caverns, Winchester, the highlands of Hot Springs, and the Northern neck of Topping. I’ve sourced and delivered 8,000 medical gloves, 2,000 head covers, 1,500 shoe covers, 400 masks, as well as protective eyewear, isolation gowns, hand sanitizers, and disinfectant sprays. The response has been amazing. Throughout my journey, I’ve learned two lessons. First, that it takes a community to serve the community. What I mean is that I’m blessed by an incredible community that includes my family, my teachers and peers at Landon, my flight school, my neighborhood, and my church. It’s been their support that has allowed me to complete each operation SOS mission successfully. Second, I’ve learned that you are never too young to think about how to serve others in times of need.
TJ Kim: (09:51)
Mr. President, you once said that America is the place where anyone can rise. And today there are youth everywhere in America rising up to help sew masks, deliver groceries to the elderly, and write thank-you letters to our frontline workers. And when I think about them, I realized just how undeserving I am to be here. Mr. President, I’m so honored by this award and I also don’t know how to repay you. Let me make you this promise instead, as long as there’s a need and as long as I can find the PPEs and fly them to rural hospitals, I’m going to do it.
Donald Trump: (10:21)
That’s fantastic.
TJ Kim: (10:22)
I promise to continue to rise and be of service to my campus, my community, my Commonwealth, and my country. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (10:29)
That’s great. Where’s your flight instructor?
TJ Kim: (10:32)
Oh, he’s right there. In the back.
Donald Trump: (10:34)
Well, how about standing up? Was he a great student? He did a good job. You did a good job out there. Thank you.
TJ Kim: (10:47)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (10:48)
Fantastic story. So, a man that I know because I spent a lot of time and spend in a place called Staten Island. Right. That’s true. Frank Siller from Staten Island, New York. Really special place. I spent many an hour, many a day with my father there over the years, and it’s just great. Nearly two decades ago, Frank founded an organization called Tunnel to Towers to support the loved ones of the fallen first responders and service members. He began this mission to honor the legacy of his younger brother, firefighter Stephen Siller, and so Steven’s looking down right now and he says, “My brother’s in the White House doing a real job.” He’s very proud of you. I know how hard you work. Coming from New York, I guess especially, Frank I know how hard you work, and you’ve done a fantastic job. We appreciate it very much, but he was one of the immortal heroes who gave his life when September 11th, 2001.
Donald Trump: (11:58)
As the virus began to spread in New York earlier this year, Frank leaped into action. He helped raise money to deliver more than 1 million pieces of personal protective equipment. That’s a lot for hospitals in the city. Frank and his army of volunteers have delivered food to firehouses and phone stations and police stations and all sorts of places all across New York and New Jersey. Frank also raised over $5 million to help pay the mortgages of families’ homes. That 25 first responders, I guess it’s a total of 25 so you have a lot of people that are very thankful, Frank. I’ve heard a lot about it. First responders and healthcare workers who have tragically lost their lives in the fight against the virus. It’s a vicious, vicious enemy. Frank, I want to thank you for continuing to support our nation’s heroes and again, your family and your brother is very proud of you, looking down and please come up and say a few words Frank, please. Thank you.
Frank Siller: (13:06)
Thank you, Mr. President, for inviting me here today and to honor and let people know the work that Tunnel to Towers Foundation is doing. My siblings and I, we started the foundation in honor of my brother, New York City firefighter. On September 11, 2001, strapped 60 pounds of gear on his back and ran through the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, which is almost two miles long, and I know you know that. It’s almost two miles long and he come out and run up West street, went into the South Tower, up those stairs, and while saving people’s life, he gave up his own. Since then, we’ve been honoring our military and first responders ever since. We built specially adapted smart homes for our country’s most catastrophically injured service members. We deliver mortgage free homes for gold star families and fallen first responder families who die in the line of duty, who leave young families behind.
Frank Siller: (14:01)
Mr. President, when you said that we are at war with an invisible enemy, we couldn’t have been more proud to know that we’re doing our job and what we’re supposed to be doing as a local foundation, as a national foundation, to make sure that we take care of the frontline healthcare workers. We follow the teachings of St. Francis of Assisi who said, “Brothers and sisters, while you are here, while you have time, let us do good.” And we know that is our guiding light from the foundation is what we strive to do every single day is to do good and not just in memory of my brother, but all those are perished in 9/11, those who have perished ever since, that have given us this great country, and those frontline healthcare workers who are willing to die for you and me today, who are on that frontline on the battlefield that you often speak about.
Frank Siller: (14:57)
And that’s why our foundation has made a commitment. We want America to make a promise to these great Americans who are willing to die for you and me, that if they go out and they give their kids a kiss goodbye and they don’t come home, that we are going to take care of them. I know we will because we are and always have been the greatest country that’s ever existed. Why? Because the goodness and the generosity of America will always take care of the greatness of America. Mr. President, thank you once again for having me here today. God bless you. God bless America and remember; we are only the land of the free because of the brave. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (15:47)
Great job. Thank you very much, Frank. Beautiful.
Donald Trump: (15:51)
In this hour of need, the world has once again witnessed the unbeatable strength of the United States of America. All across our land, heroes have raced into action. Doctors and nurses are enduring sleepless nights to save every possible life. Farmers, truck drivers, and grocers are working to keep our shelves stocked and our people fed. Families are helping neighbors in need and entire communities are rallying together to defeat the plague. This ugly, horrible plague. The five Americans we recognized today are the first of a number of individuals we will honor in the coming weeks. We’re going to be honoring a lot of great people. Our nation has just completed the 30 days to slow the spread during which every American was asked to make sacrifices to help defeat the virus. Not long ago, models predicted that between 1.5 million and 2.2 million people would have died in the United States without the mitigation.
Donald Trump: (16:50)
Through our aggressive response and the remarkable commitment and bravery of American people, we have saved thousands and thousands of lives. I can even make that if you want hundreds of thousands of lives. People were thinking in terms of 1.5 million lives lost to 2.2 without the mitigation and hopefully, we’re going to come in below that hundred thousand lives lost, which is a horrible number, nevertheless. It’s a horrible thing. Could have been stopped. Should have been stopped at the source, but it wasn’t, but it’s a tribute to this country and the people of our country, what they’ve been able to do and the amount of lives that have been saved. Because we flattened the curve, slowed the spread, and massively expanded our healthcare capacity, we’re now in the process of gradually reopening our country and it’s being done with a tremendous gusto and vigor.
Donald Trump: (17:51)
We see that all the time, don’t we Frank? They want to get out there and they want to get back. That’s what they want. They want their country back and they’re getting it back and we’re getting it back safely and we’re getting it back quickly. It’s a strategy guided by science, evidence, facts, and reason. Never-ending lockdown would inflict colossal damage on the health and lifespans of our people. Public health is closely tied to economic health. No state or country can long ignore the facts and the truth and we’re just very proud of the fact that people have put up with so much in order to keep the numbers down to the level that it looks like we’ll be having. Our finished number should be something. Think of it, we could save anywhere from a million to even 1,000,005. And I guess, if you think about it, we could save 2.1, 2.5 million lives depending on what happens.
Donald Trump: (18:47)
And with this invisible enemy, as we said, nobody knows what really happens, but we’ve learned a lot in the last two months. Throughout our history, it’s America’s love and strength, not its fears and doubts that have paved the way and paved the road to victory. Together we’ll emerge from this chapter of hardship and all of those deaths of such great souls and such great people. With new unity and resolve, our people will thrive, our industries will roar, our innovators will astonish, and America will triumph like never before. And that’s what I feel. Like never before. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Greatest employment numbers, greatest stock market, greatest number of jobs any way you want it, greatest industries, greatest creations. And one day we had to close it down. They said, “Sir, we’re going to have to close it down.”
Donald Trump: (19:48)
And we did that and everybody suffered, but they did an incredible job, and because of that we’ve saved maybe millions of lives and I just want to thank everybody. This is a scourge around the world. 182 countries as of a week ago, so it’s probably higher. 182 countries are going through relatively the same thing and it’s a very sad chapter. There was no reason for this. There was no reason for this. It should have been stopped at the source, but I’d like to congratulate these incredible five Americans and I’d like to ask them to come forward and receive their award and their recognition and they deserve it. And we’ll be watching you throughout your life. You may be around a little bit longer than me, Mr. Mailman, but I’ll be watching you as long as I can. I’m watching all of you and I want to thank you very much and to my hometown man, thank you very much. Please.
Speaker 1: (20:54)
Kyle West.
Donald Trump: (21:08)
Want to get your instructor up here? Come on. Come on up here. [inaudible 00:21:13] Okay, good. Yeah, you could come up. Why don’t you come up together? You can all come up here if you’d like. I think it would be maybe just as good.
Speaker 1: (21:25)
Libby Bish.
Donald Trump: (21:43)
That’s good. Thank you and congratulations.
Speaker 1: (21:43)
Rafael Mellow.
Donald Trump: (21:49)
Yeah, I think so. Let’s do one and then we’ll do one. Okay, let’s take one of us. Thank you very much. You deserve that.
TJ Kim: (22:03)
Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (22:32)
Almost forgot [inaudible 00:22:33]. We won’t let that happen. Thank you, Libby.
Libby Bish: (22:40)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (22:44)
So, that was great and you represent a very important part of this country and we appreciate it very much. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Bye. Thank you."
"Apr 30, 2020",6:24 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (01:26)
Well, thank you very much. Please. This afternoon, I’ll sign a proclamation declaring the month of May to be Older Americans Month. I don’t know if I’m in that category. I have a feeling I am, but I feel good and our country is making a lot of progress, Alex, I will tell you that. Making a lot of progress. As we honor the incredible contributions of our nation’s seniors, we’re here today to discuss the unprecedented steps that we’re taking to protect our seniors from the virus. I’ll also announce vital new actions to safeguard our nursing homes and most vulnerable citizens as we gradually and safely reopen our country and it’s very exciting to see what’s happening. We’re joined today by Secretary Alex Azar, thank you. Secretary Robert Wilkie. Robert, thank you very much. Administrator Seema Verma, thank you, great job. FEMA administrator, Pete Gaynor and Chief of national guard, bureau general Joseph Lengyel.
Donald Trump: (02:37)
Thanks also to Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, my friend. Thank you very much, Bill. Great job you’re doing. It’s great being with you too. And many outstanding advocates for America seniors who are here with us today, thank you all very much. As we tragically have seen, the virus poses the greatest risk to older Americans. Together as one nation, we mourn for every precious life that has been lost and there have been many. We’re so saddened by it. Through our aggressive actions and the devotion of our doctors and nurses, however, we have held our fatality rate far below hard hit other countries such as Spain and Italy and United Kingdom and Sweden. We’re way below other countries. We’re deploying every tool, resource and power at our disposal to protect our seniors and Americans of every age and background. Early on, we implemented life saving travel restrictions and directed billions of dollars toward the development of therapies and vaccines and that’s moving along rapidly.
Donald Trump: (03:48)
We’ve moved at a speed that people are absolutely stunned to see. We accelerated treatments including remdesivir, which is reportedly showing encouraging preliminary results. That was the very big story yesterday, it was announced by Gilead. In early March, my administration advised all nursing homes to suspend all medically unnecessary visits to help slow the spread and to protect our seniors, and especially in our nursing homes they are having a hard time in those nursing homes. We took action to step up enforcement of infectious disease standards at nursing homes all across America. We also acted swiftly to secure our veterans’ healthcare facilities and deployed hundreds of VA staff to help out in nursing homes nationwide, and we’re being helped very greatly by the passage of all of the things that we got passed, Robert. Especially choice, so that people can go and see their doctor when they have to, and especially our seniors.
Donald Trump: (04:56)
We provided nearly $1 billion in grants to support home delivered meals, in home care and other services that make it impossible for older people to just do what they want to do. We’re helping older people with disabilities and we’re helping them to live independently. We dramatically expanded access to telehealth, a very big deal for Medicare beneficiaries. The number of Medicare patients using telehealth has increased from roughly 11,000 a week to more than 650,000 people a week. So, that’s from 11,000 a week to 650,000, that’s almost an impossible number to believe, right? But it’s really something. They get used to it and a lot of that’s going to be staying with us long after this horrible scourge is gone. Medicare is also paying for labs to seniors with at home testing when appropriate at zero cost to patients. We’ve ensured a ventilator for every patient who needs one.
Donald Trump: (06:06)
Nobody who’s needed a ventilator has been without a ventilator. It’s an incredible achievement and we now have thousands and thousands of ventilators and other countries are asking us to help and we’re helping other countries. Allies and some that aren’t necessarily allies, but they’re in big trouble and we’re helping other countries now with ventilators. Same thing with masks, we have millions and millions of masks. That was something four weeks ago was difficult and now we have millions of masks coming in and already here. The federal government is also funding over 35,000 members of the national guard to help states deliver critical supplies to nursing homes and to assist with disinfecting and testing. I’d like to ask general Lengyel to please come up and say a few words about the work of the national guard. It’s been really fantastic. Thank you. General, please.
Joseph Lengyel: (07:08)
Thank you, Mr. president and good afternoon everyone. I’m very proud of the national guard and all they are doing to help keep our nation safe here at home and abroad. Today, over 83,000 men and women in the national guard are engaged at home and abroad, and 45,000 of those are engaged directly in the COVID-19 response. From running hundreds of testing sites around the country to screening passengers at airports to helping manufacture PPE to a myriad of other tasks, the national guard is there. We know this virus doesn’t treat everyone equally and our senior citizens are at increased risk. In many states, governors have directed national guard members to help sanitize longterm care facilities, nursing homes, giving older citizens and families and caregivers peace of mind that their environments are safe. The Georgia national guard, for instance, has done this, has sanitized over 700 nursing homes and this has been replicated at many places around the nation and continues to grow.
Joseph Lengyel: (08:10)
Additionally, food banks and homeless shelters. In normal times, these are often staffed by our volunteers. Many of them are elderly senior citizens here in America. Now, volunteering puts those great Americans at increased risk, so the national guard is helping these Americans stay clear of this risk. In doing that, the national guard is staffing many food banks across the nation where the need for food assistance is increasing across the nation as this virus continues to persist. The national guard is a big part of the United States Army and our United States Air Force, and we’re proud of that. But this role that we play here at home in the homeland, under the command of the governors and our states is distinctly and uniquely national guard business, and we’re very proud of that. So, Mr. president. Thank you for the support that you give our military and the national guard and all the men and women who serve. They are proud to serve our nation. Thank you for letting me talk about the guard today. Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (09:05)
Thank you very much, sir. That’s great. Four stars, that’s a lot of stars. Very impressive.
Joseph Lengyel: (09:12)
[inaudible 00:09:11].
Donald Trump: (09:13)
That’s right, but that’s okay. That’s very impressive. You deserve them. I do want to say, you mentioned the word governor, and we’ve had a lot of great success and relationship with the governors. We’ve dealt with our governors very well. We have really, I think, got to understand each other and know each other and in many cases, really like each other. And that’s worked out very well. We had Phil Murphy here from New Jersey, governor of New Jersey today. Wonderful man. A lot of progress is being made there. And we had John Bel Edwards and yesterday from Louisiana and Ron DeSantis the day before from Florida. Just tremendous progress. Three very exceptional men and they’re doing a really good job as you know. So, and we have others coming in. They’ll come in one or two a day and we’re seeing them in whatever we can help them with, we help them with and we help them with where very quickly, general, right? So, it’s been very good. My administration is doing everything possible to support the state led management of nursing homes, and here today is a governor who I happen to like a lot and he’s done a fantastic job in a fantastic state. A state that I happen to like a lot, it’s called Tennessee. For some reason they like me, I haven’t figured that out, but they like me in Tennessee. So, that’s good, Bill. Please come up, governor Bill Lee, please.
Bill Lee: (10:40)
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. president and thank you to your team, many in this room that we have worked with. You are guiding America through a tremendous crisis and you’re doing it incredibly well and America’s very grateful for that. And we are grateful in Tennessee for the partnership between the federal government and states like ours. As we work to make our contribution to fighting COVID-19, we can do so because of the work that you’re doing and the way that you’re supporting what we’re doing. So, Mr. president, you’ve asked states to commit to a goal of testing 2% of their population. In April, 2% of Tennesseeans were tested. And we have tested over 175,000 to date, but as we look to May, to build upon that, we’re actually strengthening our commitment particularly to the elderly, the most vulnerable of our citizens, especially those in nursing homes.
Bill Lee: (11:46)
Scripture describes being hard pressed on every side, but not crushed, and that’s where we are in Tennessee. I think that’s where we are in a nation, but the elderly are most hard-pressed in this setting, and especially those in longterm care facilities, and they need our help. So, in Tennessee, we’re committed to testing every resident and every staff in every one of our 700 longterm care facilities. It’ll be a great undertaking, but it honors the value of these lives in those facilities. Lives that have protected our country in the hardest of times, the greatest generation. And those that have a loving legacy of being our neighbors, our friends and our grandparents. And it’s time for us to protect them, and we should do so by pursuing social distancing, for example, in every way that we can with them.
Bill Lee: (12:45)
And the distance is sometimes a great gulf. I haven’t hugged my own elderly mom in eight weeks, but we’re doing right by these citizens and you’re doing the right by committing to these citizens to make certain that we do our personal part to make sure that they’re safe, and while valuing our freedoms all at the same time. So, while I think as a country we may be hard pressed on many sides, we are not crushed. And we are grateful for your leadership and for this team’s leadership and particularly your commitment to the most vulnerable in our nation, and together we will get through this. Thank you very much, sir.
Donald Trump: (13:22)
Thank you, Bill. Thank you very much, Bill. Great governor, by the way. As we take steps to safely reopen our country, we must remain especially vigilant in sheltering the most vulnerable older Americans. To that end today, I have several important announcements. First, in addition to all of the supplies we’ve already distributed, FEMA will send supplemental shipments, and I have to tell you, Pete, what a job you’ve done. Everybody at the last goal, so many of the governors said, “I want to thank him for calling you,” he called on Easter morning and he’s calling them all the time, and you call them on Sundays and you call them all the time. And I tell you, they really appreciate it, they really do. You’ve done a fantastic job, Pete Gaynor from FEMA, but FEMA will send supplemental shipments of personal protective equipment to all 15,400 Medicaid and Medicare certified nursing homes in America. Right, Pete?
Donald Trump: (14:25)
Second, CMS is providing states with $81 million from the CARES Act to increase their inspections of nursing homes at this very critical time. We have to do that and say. That’s a spot that we have to take care of, I guess you could call it a little bit of a weak spot because things are happening at the nursing homes and we’re not happy about that. We don’t want it to happen, so we’re checking that out very carefully and very methodically. Third, this week we’ll be finalizing a new rule requiring information about coronavirus cases in nursing homes to be reported directly to CDC and testing data to be posted online so everyone gets to see it. This will also requires nursing homes to report cases to residents and their family members. And finally, to ensure that our nursing homes are prepared for any future outbreaks, we’re announcing the Coronavirus Commission for Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes.
Donald Trump: (15:27)
This commission will be composed of leading industry experts, doctors and scientists, resident and patient advocates, family members, infection and prevention control specialist and state and local authorities. It’s a big deal. The commissioner will convene in May and issue recommendations, the furthest steps we can take to protect our nation seniors. My administration will never waiver in it’s relentless commitment to America’s seniors. We owe them a sacred and unbreakable obligation and we will fulfill that obligation with every resource and power that we have. We are working very hard with our seniors and we’re working very hard with our nursing homes and great progress is being made and will be made, that I can promise you. That’s also why we are strongly protecting Medicare and social security. We will protect your social security, we will protect your Medicare, we will protect you as American citizens and that goes even beyond seniors. We’re protecting this country.
Donald Trump: (16:33)
Our cherished seniors enrich every aspect of our national life. These great citizens have dedicated their entire lives to our families and our communities and our countries. Our country could not be anything near where it is without our incredible seniors. We’ll show them the same love and loyalty they’ve shown us and they’ve shown our nation every day of their lives. No effort will be spared to give America’s seniors the care and support and devotion and love they have earned and that they deserve. In a few moments, I’ll sign a proclamation designing a very special… We’ve designed a very special plan and it’s going to designate Older American Month. So, this is Older Americans Month, but first I’d like to ask secretary Azar, secretary Wilkie, administrator Verma, administrator Gaynor to share what their department and agencies are doing to help our nation’s seniors. So, just come on up and maybe you could say a few words and you’ve made a lot of progress. So, Alex, why don’t you start?
Alex Azar: (17:45)
Well, thank you Mr. president for your leadership during this pandemic and for the work that you’ve done throughout your administration to protect older Americans. I’d also like to thank the older Americans and advocates we have here today, including those working hard at the state and local level. As the president described, during this pandemic we have taken every possible effort to keep older Americans healthy and safe. In addition to our public health and healthcare efforts, president Trump has secured historic investments in programs that support older Americans and help them live independently. Over the past month, HHS has dispersed more than $1 billion in grants to aging and disability networks, which are state and local agencies, like a council on aging that provides services for seniors living in the community. This is more than a 40% increase in the annual support that we provide to these critical organizations. Services that we support, they include delivered meals like my grandmother used to get from Meals on Wheels, help with trips to the grocery store or the doctor, and assistance with chores in the home. Back in March, we put out $250 million in grants, specifically for meals, including through Meals on Wheels. We’ve been pleased to see communities get creative-
Alex Azar: (19:03)
Through meals on wheels. We’ve been pleased to see communities get creative with these funds. Some States are ensuring not only that the meals are getting to seniors, but that the meals are coming from local restaurants whose businesses are struggling. It’s not just about meals and services. We also recognize that older Americans may be facing mental health challenges and feeling isolated. Florida’s aging network, for instance, is combating social isolation by providing electronic tablets to nursing home residents to help them communicate with loved ones.
Alex Azar: (19:32)
We’re also working to protect the rights of older Americans in accessing healthcare. Our Office for Civil Rights has been taking action to ensure that States and healthcare providers do not discriminate on the basis of disability or age in the allocation of medical care. We’ve already had two States remove such discriminatory policies from their triaging guidelines as a result of our office for civil rights work.
Alex Azar: (19:55)
Finally, as the President and others mentioned, we’ve worked closely with states to ensure that they can test especially vulnerable populations like those living in nursing homes and those who care for them. This work to protect seniors and empower them will continue throughout the pandemic as we reopen our country and keep America’s seniors as healthy and as independent as possible. Thank you all for what you do in this effort.
Robert Wilkie: (20:29)
Mr. President, thank you. And thank you for everything you have done to transform the Department of Veterans Affairs on behalf of the Nation’s, nine and a half million veterans. 75 years ago, the men of the 28th Marine Regiment raised the American flag on Mount Suribachi. No event better evoked the sacrifices and the trials of the 15 million Americans who put on the uniform during World War II. A few years after Iwo Jima, the soldiers of the United States Eighth Army defended the Pusan Perimeter, and Marines fought through and out of the chosen reservoir.
Robert Wilkie: (21:13)
Veterans of those terrible times are still with us today. Early on in this crisis, President Trump gave me very explicit orders to do everything possible to protect the lives of those precious Americans. The Department of Veterans Affairs has 134 nursing homes. But more than half of the residents in those nursing homes fought in wars with battles with names like Guadalcanal, and The Bulge, and In’chon.
Robert Wilkie: (21:45)
Of the 78,000 residents in our nursing homes, we have tested all of them for the Coronavirus. We have tested all of our staff in those nursing homes. Our infection rate is low. Many of our homes have few, if any, positive cases. But still, as the President noted, we had to make a very tough decision early on. After all of these veterans had gone through so much on the battlefield, we had to tell them at this stage in their lives that we were depriving them of the sustenance of their families and friends because we had to protect their lives.
Robert Wilkie: (22:28)
Because of the President’s directions to me, we have been able to contain the virus in our nursing homes. And now, we are taking those lessons that we’ve learned from VA across the country to protect patients across America. We are the federal experts in gerontology. We are helping 38 States and territories handle the surge of patients dealing with this virus, with our partners, our great partners at FEMA, and even by direct action through the governors.
Robert Wilkie: (23:02)
Aiding America’s elderly is central to all of our efforts. We deployed VA staff, as the President noted, to veterans nursing homes owned and operated by the individual States. Early on Governors Charlie Baker and Phil Murphy moved to protect their veterans and they asked us for help. In addition to Massachusetts and New Jersey, we were helping in Alabama, Florida, and Tennessee.
Robert Wilkie: (23:29)
In California, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Texas we have taken in non-veteran nursing home patients and state veterans nursing home patients into our VA facilities. We are helping elderly Americans wherever we find them.
Robert Wilkie: (23:49)
Mr. President, you should be very proud of this VA that you have helped build. Thousands of VA employees have lept into harm’s way. VA leaders like Joan McInerney and Martina Parauda, in your hometown. Ryan Little in Boston, Rima Nelson in Detroit, Vicky Braun in Illinois and Wisconsin. Fernando Rivera and Skye McDougall in New Orleans, and Miguel Lapuz in Florida. All of them have put service before self to protect the most vulnerable and deserving. These are the folks who made America strong and free. Thank you, very much. Thanks.
Seema Verma: (24:39)
Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you for your commitment to the nation’s seniors and to the Medicare program. You’ve been very clear with me since day one that you wanted to protect and strengthen the Medicare program. And under your leadership, our Medicare Advantage program is seeing premiums aa a thirteen year low, and in our part D program it’s a seven year low.
Seema Verma: (25:02)
But, today I want to focus on nursing homes. In the scheme of life decisions, placing a loved one in a nursing home has to be one of the most difficult decisions. When you make that decision, you want to know that you can stay connected with your loved one, and that they’re going to be safe and have the best quality of life. That’s why the decision to restrict visitation in nursing homes was a heartbreaking decision. And our thoughts and prayers are with the families and the patients during this very uncertain time.
Seema Verma: (25:38)
But the tragic reality is that the Coronavirus seemed almost tailor-made to put major pressure on nursing homes. Countries across the world have struggled with their nursing home populations. But the President’s early action around nursing homes has saved countless lives. Even before the Coronavirus, we have been working on a strategy to improve quality in nursing homes. The strategy focused on quality, oversight, enforcement, and transparency for patients and their families. So they understand exactly what’s going on in nursing homes, about the conditions there. And reducing regulatory burdens so that nursing home providers can focus on providing care to their patients instead of paperwork.
Seema Verma: (26:27)
We’ve overhauled the entire survey system and implemented a common tool across the entire nation to ensure that our inspectors were being consistent, objective. And that’s actually resulted in an increase in the number of fines. We’ve updated our websites so that patients and their families have the latest information on the quality in a nursing home, and making it very clear when nursing homes have had significant cases of abuse and neglect.
Seema Verma: (26:57)
Those improvements that we’ve made, made it possible when the Coronavirus hit for us to take very rapid action on several fronts. We un-launched an unprecedented transparency effort. And that requires nursing homes to inform patients and families when there’s an outbreak in the nursing home. And to also report that information directly to the CDC. That’s going to be important to our efforts around surveillance, going forward, as we reopen the country.
Seema Verma: (27:28)
Also, we increased reimbursement for labs so that they could do more testing in the nursing home. That’s going to be very critical, as I said before, to our monitoring and surveillance efforts. Also, starting in February, we issued a series of nine guidance documents specific to Coronavirus in controlling infections in nursing homes. And, just for some perspective, normally these types of guidance documents can take months, sometimes years. But the CMS team work days, and nights, and weekends to make sure we got this information in the hands of our nursing homes to do everything that we could to protect our vulnerable seniors. We also host weekly calls with the nursing homes to help them implement our guidance.
Seema Verma: (28:15)
But federal action is just one part of the piece. States ultimately license nursing homes. That’s why we’ve been working with states to investigate outbreaks that have been going on, and inspect nursing homes. Our guidance has called upon state and local leaders to support nursing homes in their efforts to control the coronavirus outbreaks. And I commend Governor Lee, and governors across the nation that have implemented our guidance. Whether it’s cleaning their facilities, testing, and creating new Covid facilities. That helps isolate patients that are sick, and keeps other patients safe. This work has been critical to keeping nursing home residents safe.
Seema Verma: (28:59)
I’m pleased to announce that we are putting out new state grants to support state and local efforts to nursing homes. The President has been an advocate of this, he has asked for increased funding to inspect nursing homes every year in his budget. But this is the first time that Congress has provided this funding. And the money couldn’t come at a more critical time when it’ll be important to work with our state partners to ensure safety in our nursing homes.
Seema Verma: (29:26)
But, the President has directed us to do more. And so, as part of our Opening Up America efforts, we are going to oversee the Coronavirus Commission for safety and quality in nursing homes. The commission will comprehensively assess the response. It will identify best practices, and also provide recommendations for how we go forward to protect our nursing home residents and make sure we are providing the best quality of life.
Seema Verma: (29:56)
In closing, I want to speak directly to our nursing home residents, their caretakers, and their families. Your pain is our pain, and we are doing everything we can to support you. And, to the healthcare workers on the front lines providing care and comfort to our nursing home residents, we thank you. And thank you, Mr. President for your consistent leadership and unwavering support for our elderly citizens. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (30:23)
Do you want to tell them that you’re going to have some big news coming up very soon on insulin?
Seema Verma: (30:28)
That’s right.
Donald Trump: (30:28)
It’s a big deal.
Seema Verma: (30:28)
We’re doing everything we can to lower the price of insulin for our seniors, and we’ll have some great announcements coming up very soon to lower the price.
Donald Trump: (30:37)
Some big news, great news. Okay, thank you.
Peter Gaynor: (30:46)
Thank you Mr. President, Administrator Verma and members of the Coronavirus Task Force. Let me focus on the logistics in our effort to deliver personal protective equipment care packages to those citizens at highest risk and greatest need, those living in our nursing homes across the country. Thanks to the leadership of the President and the tremendous support of the white house Coronavirus Task Force, FEMA will deliver a care packages containing four items of PPE to more than 15,000 Medicare, Medicaid certified nursing homes nationwide to include the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Guam.
Peter Gaynor: (31:24)
Given the lack of availability of PPE necessary for healthcare workers providing support for nursing homes, we will provide a package, or a kit, containing a seven day supply of eye protection, masks, gowns and gloves to these 15 plus nursing homes. Each kit is individualized for each nursing home based on the level of staffing and the seven days of our supply calculation.
Peter Gaynor: (31:48)
Over the course of the next 60 days, we’ll be providing each of the nursing homes with two separate shipments of seven days of supplies totaling 14 days of supplies by the beginning of July. The first shipment of supplies begins next week. These initial shipments will focus on metropolitan area sites such as New York City, Northern New Jersey, Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. The second shipment of supplies begins in early June. The goal is to have all supplies delivered no later than July 4th.
Peter Gaynor: (32:19)
Assisting us in this endeavor is Federal Resources, a small business based out of Stevensville, Maryland who specializes in chem bio equipment support with focusing on kitting solutions for the Department of Defense. They will help us distribute the following PPE items: 608,000 pieces of eye protection, 6.9 million surgical masks, 6.4 million gowns, 31.4 million pairs of gloves.
Peter Gaynor: (32:48)
Finally, I again would like to extend my gratitude to the President for his leadership on this project. As well as to thank my fellow members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and their continued partnership. Together we have turned a critical demand for PPE for our seniors and frontline healthcare workers into reality. Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (34:26)
Thank you, Pete, great job. Well, thank you very much. And if you’d like to have some questions, maybe on this, and we might venture into different territory, also, I think. John, please.
John Roberts: (34:34)
Is that an invitation then?
Donald Trump: (34:37)
I guess. Not a wise one, but it’s an invitation.
John Roberts: (34:39)
If we could venture straight into other territory. The Vice President said, just a short time ago, he believes that General Michael Flynn may have unintentionally lied to him or misspoken when he talked to him, did not include his meeting with the Russian Ambassador to the United States. Do you believe that General Flynn may have unintentionally misled the Vice President?
Donald Trump: (35:01)
Well, I really have to talk to the Vice President. But I’ll tell you what, General Flynn was under enormous pressure and it was an artificial pressure because what they did to General Flynn was a disgrace. It was a total disgrace, it’s shocking. And I hear even more information came out today. What they tried to do to destroy him and to hurt this presidency was… Perhaps in our country’s history, there’s never been anything like it, an absolute disgrace. But I’ll rely on what the Vice President said. I can say this, and I think you understand this John very well, what happened to General Flynn should never happened again to a citizen of this country. Yes, please.
Paula Reid: (35:39)
Mr. President, you said that Michael Flynn would come back even bigger and better. So are you going to pardon him? And if so, are you considering to bring him back into your administration?
Donald Trump: (35:49)
Well, it looks to me like Michael Flynn would be exonerated based on everything I’ve seen. I’m not the judge, but I have a different type of power. But I don’t know that anybody would have to use that power. I think he’s exonerated. I’ve never seen anything like it. What they did, what they wrote. You see this General, you wouldn’t want this happening to you, what they did to General Flynn. It’s just a disgraceful, so you know, I guess we’ll get to that maybe someday or maybe not? Hopefully, we won’t have to get there.
Paula Reid: (36:21)
But would you consider bringing him back into your administration?
Donald Trump: (36:24)
I think he’s a fine man. I think it’s terrible what they did to him. It’s something that nobody’s asked me, but you’re asking me for the first time. I would certainly consider it. Yeah, I would.
Paula Reid: (36:34)
So you would bring him back?
Donald Trump: (36:34)
I think he’s a fine man. I think he’s got a great family. He loves his son. I will tell you his son was around a lot, and he loves his son as people generally do. And they did everything possible to destroy him and he’s still breathing very strongly. But they really hurt him, very badly. Very, very unfair. Kristen?
Kristen Welker: (36:58)
Quick follow… I do have a Coronavirus related question. But, in what capacity would you bring him back? If you were-
Donald Trump: (37:04)
Well, we’d look. I mean, I’m not even… This is really the first time I’ve been asked the question. But I think he’ll be fully exonerated one way or the other, and so certainly he’d be capable of coming back. He suffered greatly.
Kristen Welker: (37:16)
I want to ask you about comments by your son-in-law. One of your top advisors, Jared Kushner, yesterday said that the government’s response has been a quote, “Great success story.” Is that the right tone?
Donald Trump: (37:25)
Could you life that up a little bit?
Kristen Welker: (37:28)
Yeah, no problem. Your son-in-law, one of your top advisors, Jared Kushner, yesterday said the government’s response has been a quote, “Great success story.” Is that the right tone and message at a moment when people are still dying?
Donald Trump: (37:41)
He’s saying the facts. I mean, he’s not talking about other things that I talk about in my speech today that I speak about all the time, and that’s death. It’s horrible that what this country has gone through and what the world has gone through, frankly. This is something that could have been contained at the original location, and I think it could have been contained relatively easily. China’s a very sophisticated country and they could have contained it.
Donald Trump: (38:03)
China is a very sophisticated country and they could have contained it. They were either unable to or they chose not to and the world has suffered greatly. But what Jared was talking about and what I talk about a lot is no, I don’t think anybody’s done the job that we’ve done other than at public relations because the press just won’t talk about the facts. We had a ventilator problem that was caused by the fact that we weren’t left ventilators by a previous administration. The cupboards were bare, as I say often. And not only are the cupboards full now, we have ventilators. We’re the king in the world of ventilators, we have thousands and thousands of them now being delivered. You were at the news conferences over the last few days. The governors never, they said, “We’ve never had a case where we couldn’t get a ventilator.” And a month and a half ago, people, you, were screaming, “Ventilator, ventilator.”
Donald Trump: (38:56)
I’m just looking at the test numbers. We have more tests, we have given more tests, and the high quality tests, than every other country combined. And I say it, the friend of mine, South Korea President Moon called me, they talk about South Korea and they’ve done a really good job. But he said, “What a job you’ve done.” This is a much bigger country, you understand. He said, “What a job you’ve done on testing.” So the testing and the masks and all of the things, we’ve solved every problem, we’ve solved it quickly. But to think that now we’re giving thousands of ventilators to other countries, allies and other than allies, to be honest. But we’re helping other countries where people are dying because we have ventilators and nobody else does to this extent. And it’s a great tribute.
Donald Trump: (39:41)
I mean, Deborah, we were talking about that before, Deborah Birx, Dr. Birx has been fantastic. She’s a fantastic person, a fantastic woman. And we talk about the things that we’ve done in a short period of time. I mean, all you heard about was ventilators. That’s a hard thing. We energized factories that didn’t build ventilators. They were building cars and other things. And now we’re building thousands a week and it’s been very spectacular, it’s been really spectacular. So yeah, I don’t think anybody’s done a better job with testing, with ventilators, with all of the things that we’ve done. And our death totals, our numbers per million people are really very, very strong. We’re very proud of the job we’ve done. We had very little to work with because the previous administration left us very little. PLease, go ahead.
Speaker 1: (40:37)
Quick follow up, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (40:39)
Go ahead. Why don’t you go and then you can go?
Speaker 1: (40:40)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. You signed that executive order this morning dealing with the counter-narcotics operations that you have going on in the western hemisphere right now. Why the need for more man power? And do you think your government is any closer to the goal of having Nicolas Maduro leave office?
Donald Trump: (40:54)
Well, I need it and I sign it and we do have executive orders and they help us a lot, and they’ve helped us a very lot here. We also signed things having to do with production. As you know, I’ve used that very, very powerfully, the Act. And oftentimes, I didn’t have to use it, I just had to talk about it. Now I’m only signing when we want something when we need additional manpower or brain power or whatever it is we’re looking for the time. But we, again, we’ve done things that I don’t think anybody else has been able to do what we’ve done. And this is a big country too, is a very big country, as you know. And I’m very proud of the country. I’m very proud of the way they’ve stepped up.
Donald Trump: (41:36)
Now things are opening. As an example, Governor Lee is doing a great job in opening up Tennessee and he’s opening it up rapidly and safely. I think he said to me two words, I think, about safe and rapid. And I think safe was the first one you mentioned, in all fairness, but it was safe and rapid. He’s doing it quickly and safely and Tennessee’s a great story. But we have other governors, friends of both of ours that are doing really good job. I will say this, Governor Murphy and Governor Cuomo have a tougher situation because that’s really a hot bed. That’s a very, very dense area. People don’t realize. I think New Jersey, believe it or not, is the single most dense area in the country. Who would think that? But the Governor’s done a terrific job. And Governor Cuomo likewise is working very, very hard and speaking to me all the time. And whenever we can help him, we do. And we’re helping him and he’s helping his state. That’s what he has to do. Thank you.
Speaker 1: (42:36)
How is the operation going though? And do you feel, my second question was, do you feel you’re any closer having Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela-
Donald Trump: (42:43)
I think the operation’s doing really well. I think that things are being discovered that you wouldn’t have thought possible. The Abbott machine, Abbott Laboratory is a great, great scientific company. They came up with a machine that, I would say two months ago, nobody ever heard of this machine. And all of a sudden, boom, people come into my office, they get tested. It takes them five minutes and they feel very good. And some of them have never been tested. But these are equipment and tests that nobody ever thought even possible three or four months ago are being used commonly now. I looked at the numbers and we’re over 6 million tests. And you add up everybody together, they don’t have anywhere near that. So it’s an incredible thing.
Donald Trump: (43:28)
And it’d be great if the media could really portray it the way it is because we’ve done some unbelievable work. And when somebody uses the word successful, I mean, it really has been successful. It’s been very successful. But if you look at mortality and mortality rates, this country, it’s a very sad thing to be talking about. Whoever thought you’d be talking about such a thing two months ago? All we talked about was the economy, how well it was going. But today, we have to talk about that. Our country has really stepped up. Our generals have stepped up and our admirals have stepped up. By the way, Admiral has done a fantastic job, as you know. And we’re very proud of everybody. This whole room has been very amazing. Okay. Who’s next?
Speaker 2: (44:14)
Mr. President, you have said that China is doing everything they can to make sure you don’t get reelected. What specifically are they doing?
Donald Trump: (44:22)
Well, China doesn’t want to see me elected and the reason is that we’re getting billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars a month from China. China never gave our country anything. China gave us nothing, not 25 cents. And whether it was Biden in charge of China, which was a joke because they ripped off our country for eight years. And in all fairness to Biden and Obama, this went on long before they got into office. And you can go through many administrations until I came along. Then we signed a trade deal where they’re supposed to buy, and they’ve been buying a lot actually, but that now becomes secondary to what took place with the virus. The virus situation is just not acceptable.
Speaker 2: (45:08)
Do you think that withholding information about the virus is related to them trying to undermine your reelection?
Donald Trump: (45:16)
I don’t want to cast any dispersions. I just will tell you that China would like to see sleepy Joe Biden. They would take this country for a ride like you’ve never seen before.
Speaker 3: (45:29)
Mr. President.
Speaker 1: (45:29)
Mr. President.
Speaker 4: (45:30)
Mr. President?
Speaker 5: (45:30)
Mr. President.
Speaker 4: (45:30)
Mr. President.
Speaker 5: (45:31)
Mr. President. Yes.
Donald Trump: (45:31)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 5: (45:33)
Right. With the unemployment numbers coming out today, 30 million now unemployed, have you given any thought to possibly extending the 600 extra dollars in unemployment benefits that are given out now? They will run out and that will run out in July.
Donald Trump: (45:48)
They are looking at it and they’re taking a very strong look and we’ll be reporting to you very shortly. I will say this, obviously this is what it is. It’s this period of time. But I think I view the third quarter as a transition quarter and I think you’re going to have a very strong transition and then I think the fourth quarter is going to be incredibly successful. I think next year we’re going to have a phenomenal year economically.
Speaker 6: (46:12)
Mr. President. You keep referring to China, but do you hold President Xi Jinping responsible for misinformation?
Donald Trump: (46:20)
Well, I don’t want to say that. I don’t want to say that, but certainly it could have been stopped. It came out of China and it could have been stopped and I wish they stopped it and so does the whole world wish they stopped it. Jim?
Speaker 4: (46:32)
Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (46:33)
Say it.
Speaker 4: (46:33)
On unemployment, there are many businesses who are concerned that as America opens back up again because of a provision in the CARES Act that gives an additional $600, they won’t be able to get their employees back because they make more money staying at home than they would if they came back to work, which has caused some governors to suggest that they might strip those people of their unemployment insurance if they refuse to go back to work. Is that something you would support?
Donald Trump: (47:00)
Well, we’re looking at a lot of different things. I brought this up before I was done. This was a Democrat point and I said some people are going to be treated unfairly and some people will be treated, they didn’t get into the kind of formulas, the way I saw it. I said exactly that this was going to happen, but when you think about it, it’s basically we’re being generous with people that it’s short term and we’re being very generous with people that lost their jobs or potentially would lose their jobs, so it’s not the biggest problem that I’ve ever heard of. They’re getting a little bit more money. In some cases, they’re getting more money than they thought they would have gotten. A lot of employees are saying now the job is more important because the employer’s not going to forget that but it was something that I brought up at the beginning and nobody wanted to listen. Yeah, please.
Speaker 7: (47:47)
Follow up regarding the Joe Biden, your campaign and surrogates going after him pretty hard with regard to these allegations from Tara Reade, what do you say to Joe Biden-
Donald Trump: (47:56)
I don’t think so. I don’t think they’re going after him hard with regard to Tara.
Speaker 7: (47:59)
What do you think of the allegations and what do you say to Joe Biden?
Donald Trump: (48:01)
I don’t know anything about it. I don’t know exactly. I think he should respond. It could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations. I’ve been falsely charged numerous times. And there is such a thing. If you look at Brett Kavanaugh, there’s an outstanding man. He was falsely charged. What happened with him was an absolute disgrace to our country. And I guess three of the four women have now admitted that. And of the fourth, give me a break. I mean, take a look. 36 years. Look, this is a fine man. I saw a man suffering so unfairly. I’m talking about Brett Kavanaugh. But I don’t know, I can’t speak for Biden. I can only say that I think he should respond. I think he should answer them.
Speaker 3: (48:59)
Another question on Biden, Mr. President, another question on Biden.
Jordan: (49:00)
Thank you, sir. On China, a moment ago you said that China, it’s possible they could have chosen not to stop the spread of the virus. Are you insinuating they intentionally let it spread-
Donald Trump: (49:10)
Well, they could’ve done it. And I’m just saying, well, one of two things happened. They either didn’t do it and they couldn’t do it from a competent standpoint or they let it spread. And I would say probably it was it got out of control. But there’s another case that how come they stopped all the planes and all of the traffic from going into China, but they didn’t stop the planes and the traffic from coming into the United States and from coming into all over Europe? I mean, look at Italy, look what happened to Italy. And it’s very lucky. This country is very lucky and I’m very lucky that I put the ban on China, as you know, very early on. In January, we put the ban on in China and that was a very early day, that wasn’t a late day. That was an early day. Then we later put the ban on in Europe. And if we didn’t do that, as Alex knows, we would have had a problem like you wouldn’t have believed. We would have had a problem much bigger. But then you take a look at what happened to Italy. A lot of those people went to Italy instead and it’s been a very, very tough place, Italy.
Jordan: (50:12)
And then on holding them accountable, is that something that you prefer to do now in the next few weeks-
Donald Trump: (50:17)
No, I don’t want to do that. I want to find out what happened. I think we’ll be able to get a very good, very powerful definition of exactly what happened. We’re working on it strongly now and I think it’s going to be very powerful, but they could have stopped it. They are a very brilliant nation, scientifically and otherwise. It got loose, let’s say, and they could have kept it, they could’ve stopped it, but they didn’t. But they stopped planes from going to China, but they didn’t stop them from going to the rest of the world. What was that all about, Jim?
Jim: (50:51)
Just to help us out on this, to follow up on Jordan’s question, you praised China in the past. What’s changed? When you tweeted, “China’s been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. The US greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.” What has changed between then when you were saying those things about China and now?
Donald Trump: (51:11)
Well, what’s changed is the following. We did a trade deal and everybody was very happy. There’s nobody ever been tough on China like I’ve been tough on China. I got elected, at least partially, because of borders and military and different things. But one of the things I’d say is how China and other countries are ripping us off. So recently, we signed a trade deal with China, a number of months ago. China is buying billions of dollars worth of our product, our farm product and other product, manufacturing product, and it’s been a great deal. But then we noticed a virus. And it’s not acceptable what happened. It came out of China and it’s not acceptable what happened.
Donald Trump: (51:53)
And now what we’re doing, Jim, is we’re finding out how it came out, different forms. You’ve heard all different things. You’ve heard three or four different concepts as to how it came out. We should have the answer to that in the not too distant future. And that will determine a lot how I feel about China. But when I was, of course, I was very rough with China. I mean, Biden, as an example, the previous administration, they let China rip off this country like nobody’s ever ripped off this country. Now, what I did is I took that, I took that … Jim, I took that and I made it into a great deal for our country. But after that, all of a sudden, we heard there’s a virus and a virus is coming in. That changes my mind very greatly. That’s a whole different thing. So you can have good trade deals. That was earlier on, the trade deal. I made the trade deal earlier on and it’s a great deal. We’re taking in billions and billions of dollars of money in different forms, including the fact that we have a 25% tariff on $250 billion. It’s a tremendous amount of money. Some of that money I’ve given to the farmers because they were targeted by China. And I gave $12 billion, I gave $16 billion, and this year we’re going to be giving approximately $19 billion to the farmers.
Jim: (53:12)
Was President Xi misleading you?
Donald Trump: (53:16)
Well, something happened, something happened. I don’t say misleading or not. I’ll let you know that. I mean, I’ll be able to give you that answer at some point in the, hopefully, not too distant future. But I will tell you, you take a look at what happened to this world, a month and a half, two months ago, we had the strongest economy in the history of the world. And all of a sudden, I have to close the economy. I have to close the country. So we’ve had tremendous death and tremendous sorrow, sadness. And nobody’s ever seen anything like it. And so have most of the countries of the world, think of that, most of the countries. 184. You tell me, it’s probably low right now because I’ve been saying 184. 184 countries, they’ve suffered tremendously. It’s something that is going to have to be dealt with.
Speaker 3: (54:05)
Mr. President, on the issue of loss, Vice President-
Donald Trump: (54:08)
Say it.
Speaker 3: (54:08)
On the issue of loss, Vice President Biden has said we should lower the White House flag to half mast. Are you going to do that? And are you thinking about leading the nation in a moment of mourning?
Donald Trump: (54:18)
Well, let me say that, I mean, I would not mind doing that. I would say not only the White House flag, we could do that. In fact, it’s something that I will be talking about later. We have a meeting on various things. That’s one of the topics and we’re going to bring that up. So I think lowering the flags would be something very appropriate.
Speaker 3: (54:37)
Are you thinking about leading the country, though, in a moment of mourning for all of the lives lost, the more than 60,000 people-
Donald Trump: (54:42)
Of course I am. I don’t think anybody can feel any worse than I do about all of the death and destruction that’s so needless, nobody. But I also have to make sure that we handle the situation well. Nobody’s thinking about it more. Nobody has spent more time late in the evening thinking about what’s happened to this country in a short period of time. But at the same time, we have to get our country open again and we’re doing that step-by-step. Tennessee is an example. Step-by-step, we’re opening up our country and I really believe that next year, we can be maybe even be … We have a lot of stimulus and maybe even beyond. We’ll see about, by the way, package four, phase four. But I really hope that we can be as good or better. I built it once and we’re going to build it again. John, go ahead.
John: (55:41)
You said a moment ago, you will soon have information on where this virus originated. The Director of National Intelligence today put out a statement saying that they believe it was naturally occurring, it was not man made-
Donald Trump: (55:52)
Who is that? Who is that that said that?
John: (55:54)
The Office of the Director of National-
Donald Trump: (55:55)
Who, in particular? Who was the man who made that statement?
John: (55:58)
It was a statement that-
Donald Trump: (55:58)
Who would know that? National Intelligence, you say. So we’ll see.
John: (56:03)
That would be your Director of National Intelligence.
Donald Trump: (56:05)
Right now, I think it’s … I mean, you’d have to tell me who specifically, who made the statement.
John: (56:10)
The statement was just put out under the office of the-
Donald Trump: (56:12)
Okay, we’ll see. I mean, I have to see the statement. I just haven’t seen it.
John: (56:15)
But the question I had was have you seen anything at this point-
Donald Trump: (56:18)
Because we’re looking at that, John, separately from … We’re looking at exactly where it came from, who it came from, how it happened separately and also scientifically. So we’re going to be able to find it.
John: (56:30)
And my question is, have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?
Donald Trump: (56:41)
Yes, I have. Yes, I have. And I think that the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves because they’re like the public relations agency for China. And this country pays them almost $500 million a year and China pays them $38 million a year. And whether it’s a lot or more, doesn’t matter.
Donald Trump: (57:03)
Whether it’s a lot or more, it doesn’t matter. It’s still, they shouldn’t be making excuses when people make horrible mistakes, especially mistakes that are causing hundreds of thousands of people around the world to die. I think the World Health Organization should be ashamed of themselves.
Speaker 8: (57:19)
One thing you suggested withholding federal elation jurisdictions that are sanctuary cities. How serious is that consideration? [crosstalk 00:57:27]
Donald Trump: (57:26)
Well, I have the right to do that, but sanctuary cities, especially at a time like this, that’s a very dangerous thing. Our law enforcement hates it. They hate it. We want safe cities. We want sanctuary, but we want sanctuary for our citizens and we don’t want sanctuary for criminals that came into our country illegally and they have big records and records.
Donald Trump: (57:49)
I won’t go into the type of crimes, but the crimes are the ultimate in evil in many cases. No, we don’t want them to have sanctuary in our country. We want to have strong borders. Look, I’ll say it again. We want to have strong borders. I’ve been saying this for a long time and I think people are agreeing with me. I really do. I think people are agreeing with me.
Donald Trump: (58:06)
The Democrats want to have open borders where people just come in and you’re not only talking about coming in from a crime standpoint, you’re now talking about coming in with not only the disease that we happen to be talking about so much lately, but other diseases. And they want to have open borders. They want people to pour into our country from who knows where they come. No, we’re not doing that.
Donald Trump: (58:31)
We have a very strong border now, our Southern border, and every day it gets stronger because we’re building miles a day of very, very powerful wall and that’s a great thing for our country. That’s so important for our country and very few people are arguing with it. Yeah, please.
Speaker 9: (58:48)
You often describe this fight against the virus as a war. How do you define victory?
Donald Trump: (58:54)
So it is a war and I define victory when it’s gone and we opened successfully. We have a successful country again. Now, it can never be a total victory because too many people have died. All over the world, people have died in our country and every country. I’m looking at the new list of countries. Look at what’s going on with Russia. Look at what’s going on with Spain, so incredibly harmed and injured by this.
Donald Trump: (59:21)
So many people are dying. This is not something where you’ll go to your traditional, “Gee, this was an experience.” This is not an experience. It was a very bad experience. But what I want is we want the virus gone and we want to have a vibrant economy. We want people back. We don’t want people necessarily sitting like these incredible people in front of me where they’re sitting six feet apart and instead, I mean, I want our country back.
Donald Trump: (59:50)
I want people to go out and see football games and baseball games and basketball and hockey and golf, and all of these sports and not worry about getting sick and violently ill. One of the things that was very interesting, you probably saw it, we put it out before though was Sweden. Then you compare the deaths in Sweden to Denmark and Finland and Norway, and I hate to say it, but the deaths are very, very substantially higher in Sweden because they’ve used that as an example.
Donald Trump: (01:00:20)
Brazil is very high. If you look at what’s gone on graphically, very, very high, very, very straight up, almost. Right, Deborah? Very straight up. Friend of mine, great gentlemen, president of Brazil, he’s really a friend of mine is a great man, but they’re having a hard time. They’re going herd. Sweden went herd, but you know when they say herd, it’s really in Sweden in particular, the bars, you can’t go to. Certain areas you can’t go to.
Donald Trump: (01:00:50)
A lot of the people are saying, “Well, the prime minister doesn’t have to say, stay in your apartment, stay in your house.” They’re staying there. They’re not leaving. So it’s really not quite what was reported, but the number of deaths are tremendous in Sweden compared to the countries that surround where they did very strong lockdowns and we were discussing that, Deborah before. It’s a very big difference. It’s a very big difference.
Donald Trump: (01:01:15)
But again, Sweden didn’t go really herd as you understand it. And also the people of Sweden, very smart. This thing in their houses they’re staying at, they’re not going out. Now are some? Yeah, I guess some, but they’ve lost a lot of people in Sweden. Yes John.
John: (01:01:33)
Mr. President, could I just come back to the-
Donald Trump: (01:01:35)
Yeah, I’ll get you in a second.
John: (01:01:36)
Can I get back to what we were talking about just a second ago?
Donald Trump: (01:01:39)
Sure.
John: (01:01:40)
I missed in the interruption. Are you suggesting that maybe you have some evidence that this was not a naturally occurring virus?
Donald Trump: (01:01:51)
You’re talking about the virus and where it came from?
John: (01:01:53)
Yeah, yeah.
Donald Trump: (01:01:53)
No. We’re going to see where it is. We’re going to see where it comes from and look, you know every theory that you had the theory from the lab. You had the theory from many different, the bats know the type of bat and the bat is 40 miles away. So it couldn’t have been here and it couldn’t have been there. There’s a lot of theories, but yeah, we have people looking at it very, very strongly.
Donald Trump: (01:02:18)
Scientific people, intelligence people and others. And we’re going to put it all together. I think we’re going to have a very good answer eventually. And China might even tell us, China may tell us.
John: (01:02:28)
And what gives you a high degree of confidence that this originated from the Wuhan Institute of Neurology?
Donald Trump: (01:02:34)
I can’t tell you that. I’m not allowed to tell you that. Jeff, go ahead.
Jeff: (01:02:38)
Mr. President, would you consider having the United States not pay its debt obligations to China as punishment for the virus?
Donald Trump: (01:02:48)
Well, I can do it differently. I can do the same thing, but even for more money just by putting on tariffs. So I don’t have to do that. It’s approximately a trillion dollars, a little bit more as I understand it, trillion dollars. But we can do that in a, I think probably a little bit of a more forthright manner. You start playing those games and that’s tough. We have the dollar to protect. We want to protect the sanctity of the dollar and the importance of the dollar.
Donald Trump: (01:03:16)
It’s the greatest currency in the history of the world. Its become stronger. We have a very strong dollar. That’s why we’re borrowing at zero, zero interest rate. With all of the stimulus that we’re talking about where that sounds good though, General, doesn’t it? We’re paying zero interest. So essentially right around zero, but zero and you want to protect.
Donald Trump: (01:03:37)
It’s a very good question. You say, “Oh gee, we owe you a certain amount of money, we’re going to keep it.” But when you start playing that game, you’re really hurting the sanctity, the importance of the greatest currency on Earth. But we can do it in other ways. We can do it with tariffs, we can do it other ways even beyond that, without having to play that game. That’s a rough game.
Jeff: (01:03:55)
On a separate topic, but related Speaker Pelosi said that she envisioned up to a trillion dollars needed to help support States and localities. Would you support that figure?
Donald Trump: (01:04:05)
So what’s happening is the Democrats have come to us and they’d like to do a phase four and we’ll think about what’s happening. They want to help the States, they want to help bailouts and bailouts are very tough and they happen to be Democrat States. It’s California, it’s New York, it’s Illinois. You start with those three and the Republican States are in strong shape. I don’t know. Is that luck or is that talent or is it just a different mentality?
Donald Trump: (01:04:36)
But the Republican run States are in strong shape. Look, I looked today when I spoke, I spoke with Ron DeSantis who was here yesterday as I said, Florida’s doing incredibly. Texas is doing incredibly. These States are doing unbelievably. They don’t know about the word bailout. We had a call from the Governor of South Dakota and they have one of the finest run States.
Donald Trump: (01:05:06)
They have a, I think a constitutional amendment. They’re not allowed to, they have to have a balanced budget and they have a balanced, totally balanced budget. They just have a sales tax. That’s about the only tax they have is a sales tax and then think of that. So it’s a whole different thing.
Donald Trump: (01:05:20)
But a Republican States are doing very well. Maybe the Democrats should have brought this up earlier when we wanted certain things and they did and we said, and I said specifically, “Now let’s look at it later on down the road.: But they’d like to do something. They want to do infrastructure. I can understand infrastructure.
Donald Trump: (01:05:43)
Think of it. We’ve spent $8 trillion in the Middle East and we’re not fixing our roads in this country. How stupid, how stupid is that? And we’re not fixing our highways, our tunnels, our bridges, our hospitals even. Our schools even. It’s crazy. But they want to do things and the Republicans are in a much better position. I don’t want to use the word negotiating position, but we really are. We’re in a negotiating position that’s different because they want to bail out various States.
Donald Trump: (01:06:17)
Illinois is in big trouble. The governor understands that. Pritzker, he understands it, but Illinois in big trouble. Is it fair to do that? And then have States that are very powerful and strong like Iowa and Idaho. I mean take Idaho. Look at all of these incredible States and look at what’s going on and how successful they are.
Donald Trump: (01:06:41)
So you just take a look and we’re going to look at it. We’re going to look at it. I think we want to take a little bit of a pause, but if we do that we’ll have to get something for it. Okay. Christine, go ahead.
Christine: (01:06:55)
So just a question on masks, but very quickly to follow up on Jeff. It sounds like you’re potentially open to Leader McConnell’s called that States should apply for bankruptcy. Is that what you’re saying?
Donald Trump: (01:07:06)
It’s an idea that he has. He threw that out as an idea. I’ve spoken to him about it very strongly and we’re going to see what happens. We’ll take a little bit of a pause. We’ll see what happens. But some States are in trouble. I spoke today, I was with a wonderful man, a great gentleman, a wonderful human being. I think bill knows him too from New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy and we talked about it.
Donald Trump: (01:07:29)
New Jersey, it’s a wonderful state I have to say. It’s a wonderful place, but it’s got a lot of difficulty in terms of the economics and the debt, the costs, et cetera. So it’s in a different position than some of the other States that we could mention. We could mention them all day long.
Christine: (01:07:50)
Let me ask you about masks if I could. Vice President Pence did not wear one when he visited the Mayo Clinic earlier this week. He’s wearing one today. You are traveling to Arizona. Will you wear a mask? What is the policy for you and the vice president?
Donald Trump: (01:08:05)
Well, I’m going to have to see. I am going to Arizona. I look forward to that. I’ll have to see the climate. I mean, I’ll have to get a look and see where I am. Here’s the place that we all feel very comfortable. Everybody’s spread out. It’s a very big room. But as far as where I’m going in Arizona, I’m going to have to look at the climate.
Donald Trump: (01:08:21)
I’d have no problem wearing a mask. I don’t know if I’m supposed to make a speech. I just don’t know. Should I speak in a mask? You’re going to have to tell me if that’s politically correct. I don’t know. If it is all speaking in a mask, but I’m going to be making a speech in Arizona. I look forward to it and depending on the conditions, I would have no problem wearing a mask.
Donald Trump: (01:08:42)
We have millions of masks now. We have masks coming in that there was another thing. It was very hard to get masks. We now have and we’re making millions and millions of masks. They’re opening plants and it’s been incredible.
Christine: (01:08:55)
It sounds like you changed your position because-
Donald Trump: (01:08:56)
Go ahead.
Speaker 10: (01:08:57)
The chairman of the Federal Reserve has said that the economic recovery is going to be long and slow. You have said that it’s going to bounce back quickly. What do you know that he doesn’t know?
Donald Trump: (01:09:07)
Well, I didn’t hear what he said. I can only tell you that I see it. I think it’s going to be a transition quarter, the third quarter. I think the fourth quarter is going to be very good and I think next year is going to be fantastic because of the stimulus. And I haven’t seen the statement, but I think we’re going to have a great year next year knowing that we left behind a year of tremendous death, tremendous death. It was just a terrible thing.
Donald Trump: (01:09:32)
The likes of which we haven’t seen. I guess if you go back over a 100 years, 1917 and that was a terrible thing. But that was close depending on your account or the account anywhere from 50 to a 100 million people died, 1917. So we haven’t seen it. It’s over a 100 years. And so understanding that that was terrible.
Donald Trump: (01:09:56)
I think that next year from an economic standpoint, I mean look at the stock market. People are amazed. The stock market’s at over 24,000 well, it was a 29,000, it’s at 24,000 now. Is that even possible considering what we’ve gone through? Because people are very smart.
Donald Trump: (01:10:16)
These people are very brilliant and they look and they see a great future. The other thing, the dollar is very strong. So when we go out and do stimulus packages were oversubscribed at zero and think of it. You get your money back at zero. It’s a pretty incredible thing. The Euros having a hard time and it’s much smaller. The dollar is really become, the dollar is king and the dollars at a position now. It’s just a very powerful, it’s a very powerful thing, the dollar.
Donald Trump: (01:10:50)
Other currencies are in big trouble. They’re really in big trouble, whereas the dollar is very powerful, very strong. So the good part about that is if you do go out and if we do want to do stimulus or whatever we want to do, we’re borrowing at zero and the dollar is very strong. Okay. Yeah Tim.
Tim: (01:11:08)
Yeah, getting back to what John was asking you about the possibility that this virus came out of a lab in China. Are you insisting or would you insist on China allowing Us investigators into that lab to make sure we get to the bottom of this?
Donald Trump: (01:11:21)
Yeah, I don’t want to go into that. We’re going to say. So far I think John has been trying to be or at least they seem to be trying to be somewhat transparent with us, but we’re going to find out. You’ll be learning in the not too distant future, but it’s a terrible thing that happened. Whether they made a mistake or whether it started off as a mistake, and then they made another one or did somebody do something on purpose.
Donald Trump: (01:11:43)
Say, hey, I don’t understand how traffic, how people weren’t allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest the world. That’s a hard question for them to answer. Yeah, please. Go ahead.
Speaker 11: (01:11:56)
Mr. President, Kim Jong-un, have you got an update on his condition and whether he is alive or dead?
Donald Trump: (01:12:02)
Well, I understand what’s going on and I just can’t talk about Kim Jong-un right now. I just hope everything is going to be fine, but I do understand the situation very well. Please.
Speaker 12: (01:12:13)
Going back to when you talked about being complimentary of China early on, were you saying that you were complimentary of China because you were concerned about the trade deal?
Donald Trump: (01:12:22)
Well, I’m making a trade deal with China. This was before the virus. Of course, they’re going to be complimentary. Now it was very uncomplimentary prior to that negotiation, and then every once in a while the negotiation would break down because I’m not like Kerry who signed the worst deal, the Iran deal, which was such a disaster. And he never left the table. I left the table a lot.
Donald Trump: (01:12:43)
Anyway, we ended up making a deal, and of course, during the course of the deal, I was both complimentary and very uncomplimentary. But the bottom line is we ended up making a deal before the virus came.
Donald Trump: (01:12:54)
And I was very happy with the deal, but then later on that was superseded by a virus that should not have happened. Well, I just want to thank you all very much and we’ll see you probably tomorrow sometime. Thank you very much.
Speaker 13: (01:13:05)
Thank you.
Speaker 14: (01:13:05)
Thank you, Mr. President."
"Apr 27, 2020",Uknown,"Speaker 1: (07:07)
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States accompanied by the vice president of the United States.
Donald Trump: (07:25)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Today I’d like to provide you with an update in our war against the coronavirus. Thanks to our comprehensive strategy and extraordinary devotion to our citizens. We’ve had such tremendous support all over. We continue to see encouraging signs of progress. Cases in New York area, New Orleans, Detroit, Boston, and Houston are declining. Denver, Seattle, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Atlanta, Nashville, Indianapolis, and St Louis are all stable and declining.
Donald Trump: (08:09)
All parts of the country are either in good shape, getting better, in all cases, getting better, and we’re seeing very little that we’re going to look at as a superseding hotspot. Things are moving along really a horrible situation that we’ve been confronted with, but they’re moving along. As we express our gratitude for these hard-fought gains however, we continue to mourn with thousands of families across the country whose loved ones have been stolen from us by the invisible enemy.
Donald Trump: (08:46)
We grieve by their side as one family, this great American family, and we do grieve. We also stand in solidarity with the thousands of Americans who are ill and waging a brave fight against the virus. We’re doing everything in our power to heal the sick and to gradually reopen our nation and to safely get our people back to work. They want to get back to work and they want to get back to work soon.
Donald Trump: (09:15)
There’s a hunger for getting our country back and it’s happening and it’s happening faster than people would think. Ensuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation. These goals work in tandem. They work side by side. It’s clear that our aggressive strategy to slow the spread has been working and is saving countless lives. For those who are infected. We’ve taken unprecedented action to ensure they have the highest level of care anywhere in the world.
Donald Trump: (09:47)
The federal government has built more than 11,000 extra beds, shipped or delivered hundreds of millions of pieces of personal protective equipment. As you know, in fact, some of the people here are going to be talking about it. Some of our greatest executives, some of the greatest anywhere in the world, and distributed over 10,000 ventilators and we now have in a very short period of time, many have been delivered and hundreds of thousands are being built and frankly, every governor has more ventilators right now than they know what to do with.
Donald Trump: (10:21)
They’re actually shipping them to different locations and we’re shipping some to our allies and others throughout the world because we have ventilators like the job that they’ve done and getting this very complex piece of equipment built is actually incredible. You don’t hear about ventilators anymore except in a positive way. We’ve launched the most ambitious testing effort, likewise on earth.
Donald Trump: (10:48)
The United States has now conducted more than 5.4 million tests, nearly double the number tested in any other country more than twice as much as any other country. Think of that. Moments ago, I came from a meeting with some of our nation’s largest retailers, including Walmart, Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, and Kroger. We’re a joined by the leaders of those great companies and we also have with us the leaders from the world’s top medical diagnostics companies and suppliers, Thermo Fisher, LabCorp Quest, [US Carlton 00:00:11:26] and the American Clinical Laboratory Association.
Donald Trump: (11:29)
These are great companies. These private sector leaders along with others such as Roche, Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Hologic and Cepheid have been exceptional partners in an unprecedented drive to expand the state’s capabilities and our country’s capabilities. The job they’ve done has been incredible. The testing that’s been developed and being developed right now has been truly an amazing thing.
Donald Trump: (12:03)
I want to thank Abbott Laboratories for the job they’ve done. I want to thank Roche and in particular those two have really stepped forward Abbott with a five minute test that people can take and in five minutes they know what the answer is. I’d like to ask if I could, the executives of these great companies and they have really helped us a lot over the last 45-day period.
Donald Trump: (12:28)
We’re talking about a 45-day period when many of us met and since then what Walmart and the others have done has been nothing short of amazing. I just want to ask them to come forward and say a few words about their company plus they’re going to make a big contribution to our country. Please come forward please. Thank you. Come on up. Thanks. Thanks very much.
Steve Rusckowski: (12:56)
Thank you Mr. President and thank you all of you for being here today and what we’d like to talk about is the progress we’ve made. The last time we were here was March 13th and we’ve made tremendous progress and none of that progress could be made without the 47,000 people at Quest Diagnostics that are working around the clock and working up the test and running the test and delivering the results that we need.
Steve Rusckowski: (13:22)
As far as results, we’ve made tremendous progress. We are currently at Quest Diagnostics testing and about 50, 000 tests per day. We’ve been pushed by the task force to bring up that number. By the end of May, we’ll have 100,000 tests per day about 3 million tests, and these are the molecular tests that we do today. We’ve also brought up serological testing. We started that this past week and by the end of May we’ll be close to 250,000 a day, about 7,000 a month.
Steve Rusckowski: (13:53)
You put those two numbers together it’s about 10 million tests by the end of the May that we’ll be doing at Quest Diagnostics. We’re doing that also in a quicker way. Turnaround times were somewhat of an issue at the early days. We’ve reduced that to one to two days. Our turnaround time for people in beds, hospital beds is less than 24 hours, and we’re doing that in the same way we’ve done it with the FDA and with CLIA delivering the quality that you all expect and convenience will improve as well with convenient solutions that will be able to swab individuals more easily and also deliver to consumer the ability to have consumers choose a test online with the telehealth provider.
Steve Rusckowski: (14:34)
With that, I’d like to offer my colleague the podium as well.
Adam Schechter: (14:39)
Thank you. Mr. President. Thank you very much for your leadership and for having us all here today. Our scientists and our lab technicians are working day and night in order to do as many tests as we possibly can for the American public and to turn those tests around as quickly as possible. Just 45 days ago we said we could do several thousand tests a day. We can now do 60,000 tests a day and we’re continuing to expand that capacity every single day.
Adam Schechter: (15:11)
In addition, our scientists are working to make testing more convenient and easier. We have the swabs now that are much smaller than the original ones that we originally launched with, but we also have the Pixel by LabCorp at-home test. That test right now is for healthcare workers on the frontline and first responders, but we will be rolling that out much more broadly over the coming weeks and we’re going to roll it out with absolutely no upfront cost for the individual consumers.
Adam Schechter: (15:39)
At the same time, we are building our capacity for serology testing and we can currently do about 50,000 today and we’ll be able to do several hundred thousand per day by the middle of May. We’re going to where you’re working with the retailers. Our colleagues are here today to help them as they expand their testing capabilities across the entire country. Lastly, Mr. President, we have a rather large drug development…
Adam Schechter: (16:03)
And lastly, Mr president, we have a rather large drug development business and we will continue to work with our colleagues and the pharmaceutical and the biotechnology industry to ensure we do everything we possibly can to enroll clinical trials fast so that we can get new treatments and potential vaccines. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (16:20)
Thank you very much. Thank you gentlemen. Please go ahead.
Marc Casper: (16:28)
Mr president. Thank you and thank the administration for all of the collaboration to enable Thermo Fisher Scientific to be able to produce the test kits that companies like LabCorp and Quest and the public health labs around the world run. We met our original commitments of producing 5,000,000 kits a week and we’re up to scaling that to double that in the coming weeks in terms of supporting testing around the world. I’d like to thank my 75,000 colleagues around the world for their tireless effort to make that a reality and supporting all of our customers to have the testing necessary to get America back to work.
Donald Trump: (17:05)
Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you.
John Nims: (17:14)
Thank you Mr president. I’m John Nims with US Cotton and we are the company that is going to produce the swabs to be used in these testing kits. We have about 1200 people in our company and in our Cleveland operation they have pivoted from… As you’ve said, the Q-tip style swab to a swab that’s going to have a plastic stick with a polyester tip so that they can be assembled into these kits. Our Cleveland team has done a wonderful job with this and they’re very excited to be able to help in this effort. So thank you mr president.
Donald Trump: (17:46)
Thank you very much. Great job.
Larry Merlo: (17:54)
Mr president, thank you. I’m Larry Merlo with CVS health and it was just over a month ago that we opened up our first drive through test site and since that time we have opened wide-scale testing facilities across five States in partnership with the administration and working with the governors of Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Georgia in Michigan. And these sites are enabling us to test approximately 1,000 individuals a day with realtime results. We now have a capacity to test about 35,000 individuals each week. And this afternoon we announced plans to expand that capacity even further beginning in May, we will install testing capabilities in up to a thousand CVS pharmacies. We’ll be using our drive-throughs and our parking lots with swab testing. So again, you’ll see that coming online in may. And we also recognize the fact that the virus is disproportionately affecting our minority communities.
Larry Merlo: (18:57)
So we’re working in partnership organizations like the National Medical Association to bring testing and care into the traditionally underserved communities. We’re also beginning to implement mobile capabilities with which to do that. And as businesses are restarting their workforce, we’ll also be looking to assist them as they begin to come back to a normal operation. And finally, as my other colleagues, I just want to thank my CVS colleagues, they have done a phenomenal job in terms of helping people in many different ways all across communities in the country. And they’re part of this army of healthcare professionals and front store and first line supervisors and workers that are doing terrific things to bring our country together. And for that we owe them a huge amount of gratitude. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (19:51)
Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you.
Richard Ashworth: (19:59)
Thank you mr president. Appreciate the invitation to be here today and it was just 45 days ago when we were here. I’m Richard Ashworth, I oversee Walgreens in the US and I just want to start off Larry, like you thinking the over 200,000 Walgreen team members who are in stores every day all across America, taking care of our patients and our customers giving them essential daily needs, the prescriptions obviously that they need and even COVID testing while we’re here. We also announced today we’ll be expanding our testing capabilities across all States including Puerto Rico. We’ll be able to triple the volume that we do now in partnership with our lab partners and we’re excited to be able to do that. We’re really excited with the public private partnership that we have here because that’s what enabling us to do this and we look forward to working with the additional States to get these sites up and running as fast as possible.
Richard Ashworth: (20:53)
As a pharmacist, I just want to say one quick thing. I’m really proud to be part of this profession and not just Walgreens pharmacists and pharmacy employees, but all of them across grocery, mass independence. You’re really doing what you should be doing and what you went to school for it to help patients, counseling them on their medicines and helping them understand the problems that we’re facing. Pharmacy is right here in it with everyone together in the community and we look forward to being part of the testing like we are now serology, whatever that might look like in the future and eventually treatment when the vaccine does come. So thank you Mr president for the opportunity. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (21:37)
Great job. Thank you very much.
Rodney McMillan: (21:37)
Thank you Mr president. Thank you Mr vice president. We appreciate all you’re doing to get America back to work and doing it safely. I represent Kroger and my name is Rodney McMillan and I am so proud of our nearly half a million associates that are doing everything every day to keep customers safe and our associates safe. And one of the things that we were able to do is provide basic practices we’re doing, we call it blueprint and it’s the things that all of us can learn from on how to get America back working. We also announced earlier today continuing to accelerate our practice on testing. We are actively engaged in six States. In the next couple of weeks we’ll take that to 12 States and the number of tests that we do continues to grow faster than that. Together we will win together. We will solve this problem and move on. America is always great. Thank you again.
Donald Trump: (22:28)
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Doug McMillan: (22:35)
Thank you Mr president. My name is Doug McMillan. I’m a Walmart associate and I too would like to start by thanking our associates for everything that they’re doing in our store, Sam’s clubs, distribution centers, and in our eCommerce fulfillment centers. They’ve been inspiring and continue to have a can do attitude and step up. It’s much appreciated. We started 45 days ago as that everyone else and we’ve been operating sites for a while now. We’re now up to 20 sites across 11 States. By the end of next week we’ll be to 45 and by the end of may, we’ll be at 100 and we also, a few weeks ago, vice president Pence and I were in a distribution center in Virginia food distribution center. He was kind enough to come and thank our associates for us there, which is much appreciated.
Doug McMillan: (23:15)
And the president and vice president were speaking on the phone about surgical gowns and the president asked if we could put in an order for millions of surgical gowns and we don’t normally buy those. So I wasn’t sure if we were going to be able to do that. But I’d like to thank our apparel team and McKesson in particular for partnering with us. We’ve been able to in the month of April, secure an additional two and a half million surgical gowns and by the end of May we’ll have an additional 6,000,000 available to help. So thank you for the opportunity to serve and for being here.
Donald Trump: (23:44)
Thank you. Great job. Thank you.
Heyward Donigan: (23:52)
Thank you Mr president and thanks to the team for getting this great operation up and running for the benefit of the country. I’m Heyward Donagen with Rite Aid and we are currently operating 40% of the current test sites in 25 locations across eight States. I had the opportunity as I was driving up to stop at our Richmond location and see the testing in action and thank the associates, whether it be security or pharmacy, front end, everybody who’s helping with this great effort and all of the customers that appreciate this so much. It was really amazing to see and I want to thank my 50,000 associates also for keeping these retail locations up and running during these really, really tough times. It’s been quite amazing and we too are going to expand our testing and we’re doing about 1500 a day. Thanks
Donald Trump: (24:54)
Thank you very much. So thank you all very much. It’s incredible what we’ve done together over a short period of time. I want to thank our vice president for the task force and the work. Every day it gets better, and we had a fantastic call with the governors today and I would say that they are as thrilled as they can be, considering that the fact is that there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems decided not to do it that way and the whole world is suffering because of it. 184 countries at least, but I want to thank all of these great businessmen and women for the job they’ve done. They’ve been fantastic with us working with us and as you know, for several weeks my administration has encouraged the governors to leverage unused testing capacity in States.
Donald Trump: (25:51)
Very few understood that we have tremendous capacity. Then one week ago we provided each governor with a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of the labs where they could find additional testing capacity in their state. Within 48 hours, the number of tests performed across the country began to absolutely skyrocket. On Saturday alone, more than 200,000 test results were reported, which is a gigantic number, bigger than any country, anywhere in the world for a much longer period of time. A number that is an increase earlier in the month when we tested roughly less than 100,000 a day so we much more than doubled it and that will be doubling again very shortly. We are continuing to rapidly expand our capacity and confident that we have enough testing to begin reopening and the reopening process we want to get our country open and the testing is not going to be a problem at all.
Donald Trump: (26:48)
In fact, it’s going to be one of the great assets that we have. Today were releasing additional guidance on testing to inform the States as they develop their plans for a phased and very safe reopening. Our blueprint describes how States should unlock their full capacity, expand the number of testing platforms, establish monitoring systems to detect local outbreaks and conduct contact tracing. We have it all other countries that calling to find out what are we doing and how do you do it and we’re helping them with dealing with a lot of countries, helping them on testing just like we did on the ventilators. I directed our Medicare program to make it easier for seniors to get the testing that they need and the pharmacies… as you know, we are allowing pharmacies now to do testing and we have other testing locations that we’re going to be allowing also.
Donald Trump: (27:43)
But having pharmacies get involved in testing is a very big deal. We’re also asking governors to do the same in their Medicaid program, so they are going to be able and authorized to do the same in Medicaid. So it’s a big, that’s a big deal. So we’re deploying the full power and strength of the federal government to help States, cities to help local government get this horrible plague over with and over with fast. There is tremendous energy in our country right now. There’s energy like people haven’t seen in a long time, a spirit that they have not seen.
Donald Trump: (28:19)
And we’re doing very well, very well considering what happened to us and considering if you look at what happened to others, this is something that the world has not seen for a long, long time. You can probably go back to 1917 where it was a terrible period of time. You all know what happened in 1917 that’s over 100 years ago. With that, I’d like to introduce if I might, Dr Birx, if you could come up and then Edmond you’ll come up and between the two of you, you’ll explain the entire process and how much progress we’ve made and where we’re going. Thank you very much.
Dr. Birx: (28:59)
Thank you mr president. So the blueprint lays out the roles and responsibilities to enhance our partnership between the private sector and the public sector, bringing together State and local governments with the federal government to ensure that we can accomplish and achieve our core principles and objectives. We can have the first slide. The core elements of the testing plan include both three elements, robust diagnostic testing plans developed in partnerships with State. And I just really want to thank the governors and the health officials both at the State and local levels who’ve been working with us day and night to work through these issues and also all the laboratory directors in many of the States as well as the American society for microbiology who’ve been working with us to ensure that the plans were efficient and effective. Within the robust diagnostic testing plans, it was really unlocking the full capacity of the State, increasing the number of testing platforms.
Dr. Birx: (29:57)
We now have multiple tests for different platforms, increasing the ability to collect samples, increasing testing and laboratory supplies, and ensuring that we work together to make sure that every client receives the test that they need. This is added with timely monitoring systems, and what do I mean by that? Systems where we bring together the ability to not only diagnose the symptomatic, but proactively and interactively work with individuals that we know are at higher risk. We’ve worked with States to look at where the outbreaks have occurred when they’re not in the large metros. And we see that it occurs very often in places of close settings among our native Americans and among our longterm care facilities.
Dr. Birx: (30:40)
So an active monitoring program that’s active, integrated and innovative. And then combining us with a third element, which is the rapid response program relying on CDC to be working with State and local governments to ensure that every symptomatic case and critically the asymptomatic cases are quickly tracked and traced to ensure that we can not only control this epidemic but predict outbreaks before they expand. And then finally, the plan includes approach of using science and technology to develop even newer platforms, more efficient testing, really ensuring that the antibody tests that are utilized and recommended by both FDA and CDC have high quality in predicting both exposure to the virus and antibody development. And then finally working on innovative tests that could be high throughput and point of care, and antigen based test or a point of care expanded nucleic acid test. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (31:37)
Very good. Thank you. Admiral please.
Admiral Giroir: (31:46)
Thank you Mr president. And thank you ambassador Birx. If I could have the next slide please. I want to spend just a couple of minutes about going over where we’ve been, but more importantly, where we’re going. I think we all can understand how we can group this into three distinct…
Admiral Giroir: (32:03)
I think we all can understand how we can group this into three distinct phases. First is our launch phase. When we were really engaging the emerging epidemic and the types of things we need to do. For example, mobilize the private sector to develop tests and have EUAs. And I think you know, over the past two months the FDA has issued 67 Emergency Use Authorizations, which is far outpacing anything that has been done or could ever been imagined. Galvanizing the research community and the commercial labs. The reason why we’re here with ACLA Labs having done about three million tests is because of that day when it was galvanized by the President and the Vice President.
Admiral Giroir: (32:40)
We also set models in the community. Those first community-based testing sites that were federally supported, and really under the direction of the US Public Health Service, people who had been in Japan testing people on the Diamond Princess to assure that it would be done right and it would be done safely for everyone involved.
Admiral Giroir: (32:58)
Then we moved to really scaling. That phase was very, very important because we knew we needed to be at an immense scale to enter the third phase about supporting opening again. This again, for example, a lot of my life is about swabs. It was enhancing the production capability of a small company in Maine called Puritan, that you’ll hear a whole lot more about, that is sort of the swap provider for the country. But also because of the FDA actions and the actions of scientific community being able to broaden the types to spun polyester. So US Cotton can now come in and start delivering within the next couple of weeks 3 million swabs per week of a different type. It also did things like expanding the community based testing sites. Whereas we started small with the commercial partners, you see today, right now, we have 73 of this 2.0 sites going to 110.
Admiral Giroir: (33:52)
And very importantly, this demonstrated the model and 68% of those sites are in communities of moderate or high social vulnerability. And 22% are in the highest social vulnerability communities so that we can make sure the testing gets where it needs to be. You’ve just heard that that could be expanded to thousands of sites.
Admiral Giroir: (34:12)
And finally, Stage Three, which is very exciting. Coordinating with governors to support testing plans and rapid response programs. Over the past week, a multidisciplinary team from the White House, HHS, FDA, FEMA has met virtually with multidisciplinary teams from every State, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia to understand what their testing aspirations are, and to make sure that we can meet those demands. We’re going to have another round of those calls this week. But as we talked about earlier today, we will be able to supply every state with the supplies and the tests that they need, that will dramatically increase the number of tests we’ve done to this point.
Admiral Giroir: (34:57)
Just to give you an idea, the supplies that we will be providing to States, the minimum that we’re supplying to States, is approximately double in that month then the Republic of Korea has performed in the four months to now accumulated. To give you an idea of the amount of testing that we’re going to be doing.
Admiral Giroir: (35:16)
So, I’m very exciting right now as we complete this ecosystem with the large reference labs, the LabCorp and Quest, providing the very high throughput, large scale testing. The galvanizing of the hospitals and academic labs that Dr. Birx has done by a machine to machine understanding and promoting that with the governors. And, of course, using point-of-care testing when and where that’s very important to stop outbreaks, or in remote areas like in the Indian Health Service or in Alaska. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (35:49)
Great job. Okay, so with that we’re here to answer some questions and Mike is up here also, so we’ll answer. Steve, please go ahead.
Steve Holland: (35:59)
As governors grapple with when and how to open their states, what’s the best advice from you on what they should do? How quickly, how slow should they-
Donald Trump: (36:06)
We want them to do it. We recommend that they do it as quickly as possible, but safely. We want everyone to be safe. And I think you’re seeing that, you’re seeing a lot of governors get out and they want to open it up. Many are thinking about their school system, not a long way to go in the school system right now for this season, for this year. But, I think you’ll see a lot of schools open up, even if it’s for a very short period of time. I think it would be a good thing. Because as you see, in terms of what this vicious virus goes after, young people seem to do very well. Young people seem to do very well. So I know that there are some governors that aren’t necessarily ready to open up their states, but they may be ready to open up their school systems. We’ll see. But that’s their choice. But the word is safety. Okay? Rapid. But safety. Yeah. Please. Go ahead, please.
Jon Decker: (36:57)
Thank you, Mr. President. I had a question for you regarding one of the members of your Coronavirus Taskforce. And that’s Secretary of HHS, Alex Azar. On January the 28th he was in the briefing room, and in the briefing room he told reporters that for the individual American the virus should not be an impact on their day to day life. Three months later, more than 55,000 of our fellow Americans have now lost their lives. Mr. President, why is he still your top health advisor? Why is he still serving as the HHS Secretary?
Donald Trump: (37:32)
Well, I think it’s a very unfair question. Because you have many great professionals, some of them you have great respect for. And you have many people on the other party, you mentioned Alex Azar, but you have many people in the other party that have said the same thing and with even more confidence. So a lot of people didn’t get that right. I was very fortunate, whether it was through luck or whatever, that we closed the border. We put a ban on China other than our citizens coming in. We had our citizens, you can’t keep out American citizens. You know, “Gee, you can’t come back into your country,” that’s a little tough to do. But we put a ban on China, that was very fortunate. But I could tell you that Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets in Chinatown. She wanted to go, “Let’s go out and party.” That was late into February, so you don’t mention that, but you could mention that. Go ahead. Any other? Please, go ahead.
Jon Decker: (38:22)
…since April third Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (38:25)
Go ahead. Yeah please, stand up.
Jon Decker: (38:26)
He has not been in a briefing, Mr. President, since April the third. Does that show confidence in him?
Donald Trump: (38:28)
You should have no complaints. Please.
Jon Decker: (38:29)
But, but-
Mario Parker: (38:30)
Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday you retweeted someone who alleged that Democrats have, quote, “inflated,” the mortality rate of the coronavirus by under-reporting the infection rate. Do you believe that’s true? That there’s some sort of conspiracy theory regarding the number of infections States are reporting?
Donald Trump: (38:50)
Well, I can only say what we’re doing. We’re reporting very accurately. If you look at other countries, other countries are not. I mean, you can look at China, you can look at numerous countries where I don’t think those are right numbers. I can only say what we’re doing. It’s very important to us to do very accurate reporting and that’s what we’re doing. John, go ahead please.
Mario Parker: (39:07)
…by retweeting that, Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (39:07)
Thank you, please John?
Jonathan Karl: (39:08)
Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the Payment Protection Plan, the PPP plan to help small businesses. There’ve been a lot of concerns today with the website just not working. In fact, we heard from the American Bankers Association saying that they are deeply frustrated and until it’s fixed American banks will not be able to help struggling small businesses. Do you know-
Donald Trump: (39:30)
Well, I just came out and I hadn’t heard. I heard there was a glitch. We’ll find out whether or not that’s so. Certainly it did work out very well for the original amount of money. This is the second amount and I’ll find out about that. We’re relying on the banks to go out and do an accurate job. Yeah, please. In the back.
Charlie Spiering: (39:47)
Thank you.
Jonathan Karl: (39:48)
… of all the companies that get aid, Mr. President-
Donald Trump: (39:49)
Well, I wouldn’t mind doing that. I don’t know what the legal status of something like that. I would like to do that, as far as I’m concerned. I’m not involved in that process, but I would certainly like to have it listed. I’d have to find out if there’s a legal problem, but if there isn’t I would do it gladly. Please.
Charlie Spiering: (40:04)
Thank you, Mr. President. Charlie Spiering, Breitbart News. A majority of polls show that Americans blame China for the spread of the coronavirus and yet they’re taking advantage of the crisis to make the world more dependent on their supply chains. How do you hold China accountable and how do you keep our country-
Donald Trump: (40:23)
Well, Charlie, there are a lot of ways you can hold them accountable. We’re doing very serious investigations, as you probably know. We are not happy with China, we are not happy with that whole situation. Because we believe it could have been stopped at the source, it could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn’t have spread all over the world. We think that should have happened. So, we’ll let you know at the appropriate time. But we are doing serious investigations.
Charlie Spiering: (40:46)
… American businesses from relying on China for their supply chains. How do you fix that?
Donald Trump: (40:52)
Well, we’ve already discussed that and especially having to do with supplies, and others. If you look prior to this virus, the deficit was coming way down under my administration because I put massive tariffs on China. We took in tens of billions of dollars, gave some of it to the farmers who were unfairly targeted by China. Nobody’s ever done that before. We never took in ten cents from China. Now all of a sudden, I think you know very well, we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars. I helped the farmers by giving them, two years ago, $12 billion all coming from China. And we had plenty of leftover, too. And then the following year, 16 billion and this year we’re also going to help our farmers. But nobody’s ever done a thing like that because they were targeted unfairly by China. So we’re doing a very strong investigation and we’ll let you know what the result of that is. We should be able to get the answers, too.
Donald Trump: (41:45)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 5: (41:46)
As you talk about potentially reopening up America again, as we see in the slides behind you, what data are you going to look at in the future to see if restrictions need to be reimposed?
Donald Trump: (41:55)
Yeah, we’re looking very much, and reliant very much on the local areas, the governors. And that’s been the way it has been for me, maybe not for everybody, but for me that’s the way it’s been at the beginning and from the beginning. The governors, some of them are doing an extraordinary job, not all of them, but some of them. And I think all of them, maybe, hasn’t had a chance to do that. Some will be a little bit different. The areas are much different. Manhattan is much different than Montana. You have a lot of different circumstances. And obviously, if you look at the virus, it hits some areas, hasn’t hit very much other areas not even at all. Almost not at all. But the entire country has been infected. West Virginia, as an example, I spoke to Jim Justice, the governor of West Virginia. And they were a long before anything hit, and they had numerous deaths even in West Virginia, and they were really the last one to be hit.
Donald Trump: (42:49)
So we’re dealing with the governors. We had a really great call today, as I told you, very, very solid. These were not complaining people. These were people that… They had everything they needed, they had their ventilators, they have their testing. They see their testing is growing, they’re growing their testing, we’re helping them. We’re getting them what they need. I’m sure some of you are on the line, even though you weren’t supposed to be, and I think you know what the result of that call was. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 6: (43:20)
Following up on Charlie’s question on making China, holding them responsible. Germany sent a bill to China for 130 billion Euros for the damages caused by the coronavirus. Would your administration look at doing the same?
Donald Trump: (43:36)
Well, we can do something much easier than that. We have ways of doing things a lot easier than that. But Germany’s looking at things and we’re looking at things. And we’re talking about a lot more money than Germany’s talking about. Yeah.
Donald Trump: (43:47)
Please, go ahead. We haven’t determined the final amount yet. It’s very substantial. If you look at the world, I mean, this is worldwide damage. This is damage to the US, but this is damaged to the world. Yeah, please.
Yamiche Alcindor: (43:59)
Thank you, Mr. President. Attorney General, William Barr directed federal prosecutors to watch out for state and local officials that might be violating the constitution by some of their stay at home or orders. What’s the strategy there? Would the Federal Government sue local authorities?
Donald Trump: (44:13)
Well, you’d have to ask Attorney General Barr. But I think he wants to see, like everybody, he wants to see people get back and wants to see people get back to work. He doesn’t want people to be held up when there’s no reason for doing it. In some cases, perhaps, it’s too strict. He wants to make sure that people have their rights and they maintain their rights. Very importantly. So, a lot of people would agree with him. But you’d actually have to ask that question specifically, from a legal standpoint, to Attorney General Barr.
Yamiche Alcindor: (44:38)
… the Federal Government suing state officials?
Donald Trump: (44:39)
It would depend on the state. It would depend on the circumstances of the state. But some states are perhaps a little early and some states are a little bit late. And the Attorney General… I read that and I saw that, and frankly, the Attorney General doesn’t want to have rights taken away. Because, there are some people that aren’t allowed to open up a store, they’re going to lose their livelihood. And by the way, that causes death, also. Between all of the things that happen, and this has been a big study. The fact that people aren’t allowed to have their freedom causes a tremendous amount of problems, including death. So that’s what he’s talking about.
Donald Trump: (45:17)
Please, in the back.
Speaker 7: (45:20)
… now and in other states. Governor Larry Hogan specifically said they’ve seen a spike in people using disinfectant after your comments last week. I know you said they were sarcastic, but do you take-
Donald Trump: (45:31)
I can’t imagine why, I can’t imagine why. Yeah.
Speaker 7: (45:34)
…take any responsibility if someone where to die?
Donald Trump: (45:35)
No, I can’t imagine, I can’t imagine that. Yeah, go ahead please.
Speaker 8: (45:38)
…President. Dr. Anthony Fauci says that we need to increase testing by double it, at least. And so does the Rockefeller Foundation. When are we going to be doubling testing?
Donald Trump: (45:48)
It doesn’t really matter what they say there, and we just left him. We just had a meeting. Because we’re going to have much more than double it, very soon. Now there are big believers in testing and then there are some governors that don’t feel as strongly about it at all. You understand that, they feel much differently about it. But we’re going with maximum testing because it’s something we’re very capable of doing. But we’ll be much more than doubled. You know, Mike, I’d like you to answer that. We’re going to be much higher than doubled on testing very shortly. Mike, please.
Mike Pence: (46:24)
Thank you, Mr. President. I hope the American people looking on today are as proud as the President and I are of the incredible public and private partnership that you heard from today. It was two months ago that we had done less than 10,000 tests for the coronavirus in the United States. But because the President brought together these incredible commercial labs, brought together the best known retailers in America, now Mr. President, we have 5.4 million tests. And as you said earlier today we’ve done more than 200,000 tests in a single day.
Mike Pence: (47:06)
As we met with governors today, I sensed the enthusiasm among governors for the way that testing is scaling all across the country. And, we assured them on the call today that we’re going to continue to directly partner with them to make sure that all of the resources you’ve heard about today continue to be expanded.
Mike Pence: (47:26)
I want to ask Admiral Giroir, who is literally working day in and day out with the governors, to describe some of the numbers for exactly where we will be. We’re North of 5 million tests done now. It is remarkable to think of the pace of acceleration. But Admiral, maybe you could speak about exactly when we will reach the point that some of the experts say that they think we need to be at. Whether that be the 300,000 tests a day or 500,000 tests a day. But what’s remarkable to me as a lay person, Mr. President, is because of this partnership you’ve forged. We’re almost there.
Mike Pence: (48:03)
Because of this partnership you’ve forged, we’re almost there. And we’ll be there very, very soon for the American people. But everyone who is anxious to see America reopen, as this president and our entire administration are, should know that the three-phased approach that the president outlined 10 days ago, we believe, and I believe increasingly governors understand around America, that we have a sufficient amount of testing today for every state that qualifies to enter phase one to begin to reopen their economies. And Mr. President, with your permission, I’ll just ask Admiral Gerard to give some specific numbers about for all that we’ve done, how much more quickly you’ll see an expansion of testing because of the partnership that you witnessed again here today.
Admiral Giroir: (48:49)
Thank you Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. The number of tests that need to be done depends on the state level. You understand that places where there’s high virus circulating will need many, many more tests. Places that do not have high virus circulating may need less tests. But let’s just assume Dr. Fauci was talking about about a four million per month number, which was sort of a week ago where we are. So we will, according to the governor’s plans for next month, we will easily double that four million number. We will have over 20 million swabs that we’re going to send out. We will have over 15 million tubes of media. We have all the tests matched machine to machine in a focused area. We’ve gone state by state and understand that.
Admiral Giroir: (49:39)
And this is not even including what you just heard, the five million per month test by LabCorp and Quest, or the point of care test by Abbott, or all the other tests that are out there. So in May, we are going to be doing more testing in this country. And people talk about South Korea a lot. The states with the least amount of testing will double the overall cumulative number per capita that South Korea has done in four months, to give you that understanding.
Donald Trump: (50:11)
Go ahead, John.
John: (50:12)
Good morning. This sounds incredibly promising. Walgreens, CVS for the drive through test, the diagnostic agencies. But we sat here in the Rose Garden back on March 13 and these companies were here, some other companies were here. By my count, only 69 drive through test sites have been set up by the companies that were here. I’m wondering if… And of course Mr. Vice President back in early March, you said we’d be at four million tests by the following week. We’re just now got there in the last few days. So what have you learned about what went wrong a month and a half or over the last month and a half or two months? And what’s going to go right now? What lessons have you learned from the mistakes over the last month and a half or so?
Mike Pence: (50:53)
John, I appreciate the question, but it represents a misunderstanding on your part and frankly a lot of people in the public’s part about the difference between having a test versus the ability to actually process the test. The truth was when the president tapped me to lead the White House Coronavirus Task Force two months ago, we saw the production of lots of test kits going into the marketplace. But as the president has said many times, what he understood early on was the old system would never be able to process the tests at the massive volume that we would need in the midst of an epidemic. And that’s why the president brought together these extraordinary commercial labs that you’ve heard from today. Literally sat them down in the Roosevelt Room and said, “We need you to turn all of your energies loose on doing the kind of high speed testing that would be necessary for us to reach the numbers we’re at today.”
Mike Pence: (51:52)
And so there was no disconnect at all. There were lots of test kits out there, and well frankly there still are today. There are literally millions of tests that could be run in the old style slow laboratory that are still conducting tests today, whether it be at the CDC or at state laboratories. But what the president brought about with this public private partnership has brought us to the point where we’ve done 5.4 million tests to date. And literally, you just heard that by next month, we could be doing as many as two million tests a week all across the country to give the American people confidence that we can reopen and get our economy moving again.
John: (52:34)
So when you said four million tests seven weeks ago, you were just talking about tests being sent out, not actually being completed? I’m a little confused.
Mike Pence: (52:43)
John, I think, precisely correct, that in my first week on this job, we were informed that HHS, I believe IDT was the vendor, Admiral Gerard, that had distributed a million, was distributing another four million. And we believe they did. But again, those were tests that frankly, but for the president’s leadership, we’d still be waiting on those tests to be done in many cases, because they were tests that were designed to be run in the old laboratory model. But early on at the president’s direction, we brought in these incredible commercial labs. We partnered with these extraordinary retailers and now we stand here today. Literally one day last week, more than 200,000 tests in a single day. About the time that we were making those comments, we’d done less than 25,000 tests in the entire country. But we’ve met this moment with American ingenuity, with the incredible companies that are represented here, and we couldn’t be more proud.
John: (53:40)
Follow up, Mr. Vice President. A follow up.
Donald Trump: (53:42)
I think it’s very important to know, and this you can get from any other country I think if they’re being honest, not only do we have the most testing in the world by far, but we have by far the best testing. OAN please. Go ahead.
Speaker 9: (53:56)
Mr. President, thank you. As I’d like to switch gears and talk about general Flynn. There are reports circulating now that he may well be fully exonerated this week. If that were the case, is there any reason why you would not bring him back into the administration?
Donald Trump: (54:15)
I will only say this. I think that general Flynn is a wonderful man, he had a wonderful career, and it was a disgrace what happened to general Flynn. Let’s see what happens now. But what happened to general Flynn should never happen again in our country. What happened to other people should never happen again in our country. What happened to your president of the United States should never again be allowed to happen. Go ahead please.
Speaker 10: (54:49)
Mr. President, thank you. Today, one of your top economic advisors, Kevin Hassett, he said that the US is likely to experience a 20 to 30% decline in the GDP in the second quarter, the worst since the great depression. Do you agree with that assessment?
Donald Trump: (55:05)
I don’t know, but I can tell you the third and the fourth quarter in particular are going to be, I think, spectacular. We were talking about it with the executives. I think we’re going to have a phenomenal third quarter. Nobody except one country can be held accountable for what happened. Nobody’s blaming anybody here. We’re looking at a group of people that should have stopped it at the source. But so what happens in second happens in second. What we are doing is I think we’re going to have, you’re going to see a big rise in the third, but you’re going to see an incredible fourth quarter and you’re going to have an incredible next year. I think you’re going to have a recovery. Look. I built, they were just telling me inside and it’s fact, I built the greatest economy. With the help of 325 million people, I built the greatest economy in the history of the world. And one day because of something that should have never been allowed to happen, we had to close our country, we had to close our economy. I built it. We had the best employment numbers and the best unemployment numbers for Hispanic American, for African American, for Asian American, for everybody, best stock market numbers. And by the way, the stock market was up very substantially today and people are seeing a lot of good things. A lot of very smart people investing in the stock market right now. It’s at 24,000, approximately 24,000. And if you would have said with the tragedy that this country had to endure and go through, with all of the death and the people that died and were so badly hurt by what happened. And you can only say God bless them. But if you would have said that our country would be in the position we’re now. We’re ready to move forward.
Donald Trump: (56:56)
We’ll never forget loved ones. We’ll never forget these great people that sacrifice for a reason of incompetence or something else other than incompetence, what happened at a point where they could have protected the whole world. Not just us, the whole world. But we had the greatest economy ever in the history of our world. And I had to turn it off in order to get to a point where we are today. And now we’re making a comeback. And I think we’re going to have economically, from an economic standpoint, next year an unbelievable year. And I think that you’re going to see a fantastic fourth quarter and the third quarter, we’ll start to build. But the second quarter, obviously you’re going to have GDP lack of growth. I’m looking at the head of Walmart. What a job Walmart’s done in going through something. They were doing yeoman’s work, including getting us millions of really very, very protective outfits. And the job that Doug and Walmart did was incredible.
Donald Trump: (58:02)
Millions of outfits. And those are high quality. I’ve seen them. Those are high quality. That’s what we need. So people have stepped up to the plate. I think we’re going to have a really good. I think it’s going to start building. I think it’s going to build fast. I think it will be a tremendous, tremendous comeback. And so I say, I built the greatest economy. With all of the people that helped me and all of the people in this country, we built the greatest economy the world has ever seen. And we’re going to do it again. And it’s not going to be that long. Okay. Yes, please go ahead.
Speaker 11: (58:32)
Mr. President, opening up the country, how long will you keep up the travel restrictions for Europe?
Donald Trump: (58:38)
Well, we’re looking at that and it depends on how long it’s taking Europe to heal. Italy is starting to make a comeback. I’m very happy to see that with my friend, the prime minister. It’s tragic what went on in Italy, and Spain, and France, and Germany frankly, and every country over there. It’s tragic. But we’ll be looking at what’s happening in Europe and certainly we want to do that and they want to do it too. They want to do it very badly. Yeah.
Speaker 12: (59:03)
Do you have any update on Kim Jong-un’s health?
Donald Trump: (59:07)
Say it.
Speaker 12: (59:07)
Have you gotten any update on Kim Jong-un’s health? Has he responded to your letter from March?
Donald Trump: (59:12)
On Kim Jong-un? I can’t tell you exactly. Yes. I do have a very good idea but I can’t talk about it now. I just wish him well. I’ve had a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un. If I weren’t president, you’d be in war. You would have been in war with Korea. You would have been in war with North Korea if I wasn’t president. That I can tell you. He expected that. That I can tell you. I hope he’s fine. I do know how he’s doing relatively speaking. We will see. You’ll probably be hearing in the not too distant future. All right, one or two more. Go ahead. Please.
Speaker 12: (59:49)
Are you confirming he’s alive?
Speaker 13: (59:50)
Yeah, I had a question about the 2020 election. Your likely Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, recently suggested that you were considering changing the date of the election, that you might try something like that. That’s my first question. The second question is-
Donald Trump: (01:00:05)
I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? November 3rd, it’s a good number. No, I look forward to that election and that was just made up propaganda, not by him but by some of the many people that are working, writing little statements. I see all the time statement made, you say so statement made per Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe. He didn’t make those statements but somebody did. But they said he made it. No, let him know I’m not thinking about it at all. Not at all. Go ahead, in the back please. Please.
Speaker 14: (01:00:37)
The bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee came out with the fourth installment of this report. It concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections and there was not political bias. Do you accept its conclusions?
Donald Trump: (01:00:47)
Oh, I don’t know. I haven’t seen the report. I haven’t seen the report. Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 15: (01:00:51)
President, nice to see you. I think you have a good relationship with North Korea and with Kim Jong-un, but last Saturday, Senator Graham, he mentioned in the Fox News, he interviewed. He said that-
Donald Trump: (01:01:10)
He didn’t say anything last Saturday.
Speaker 15: (01:01:12)
… that Kim Jong-un-
Donald Trump: (01:01:14)
Nobody knows where he is, so he obviously couldn’t have said it. If you have a… This is breaking news that Kim Jung-un made a statement on Saturday. I don’t think so.
Speaker 15: (01:01:22)
But anyways-
Donald Trump: (01:01:22)
Okay, go ahead.
Reporters: (01:01:23)
[crosstalk 00:13:23].
Donald Trump: (01:01:24)
Let’s do one more. Please, in the back.
Speaker 16: (01:01:26)
If an American president loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died in the entirety of the Vietnam War, does he deserve to be reelected?
Donald Trump: (01:01:36)
So yeah, we’ve lost a lot of people, but if you look at what original projections were, 2.2 million, we’re probably heading to 60 thousand, 70 thousand. It’s far too many. One person is too many for this. And I think we’ve made a lot of really good decisions. The big decision was closing the border or doing the ban, people coming in from China. Obviously other than American citizens which had to come in. Can’t say you can’t come back to your country. I think we’ve made a lot of good decisions. I think that Mike Pence and the task force have done a fantastic job. I think that everybody working on the ventilators, you see what we’ve done there, have done unbelievable.
Donald Trump: (01:02:17)
The press doesn’t talk about ventilators anymore. They just don’t want to talk about them and that’s okay. But the reason they don’t want to talk… That was a subject that nobody would get off of. They don’t want to talk about them. We’re in the same position on testing. We are lapping the world on testing and the world is coming to us. As I said, they’re coming to us saying, “What are you doing? How do you do it?” We’re helping them. So, no, I think we’ve done a great job and one person, I will say this, one person is too many. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you."
"Apr 22, 2020",5:25 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
(silence).
Donald Trump: (02:06)
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (02:12)
A lot of tremendous things are happening. The number of new positive cases continue to decline nationwide. Recent hotspots appear to be stabilizing. The hotspots are, in some cases, very interesting what’s going on and they’re going down, they’re going in the right direction. Cases in the Boston area now declining. The Chicago curve appears to have flattened, which is terrific, and Detroit is past its peak. These trends demonstrate that our aggressive strategy to battle the virus is working and that more states will soon be in a position to gradually and safely reopen. It’s very exciting. It was very exciting even today, watching and seeing what’s happening and people are getting ready and they’re all excited.
Donald Trump: (03:01)
I do want to mention a man who’s done a very good job for us. Dr. Robert Redfield was totally misquoted in the media on a statement about the fall season and the virus, totally misquoted. I spoke to him and he said it was ridiculous. He was talking about the flu and corona coming together at the same time and corona could be just some little flare ups that we’ll take care of. We’re going to knock it out. We’ll knock it out fast. But that’s what he was referring to, coming together at the same time. And I think rather than waiting, I’d ask Dr. Redfield to come up and say a couple of words just to straighten that out, because he didn’t say it was a big explosion.
Donald Trump: (03:44)
The headline in The Washington Post was totally inaccurate. The statement wasn’t bad in the post, but the headline was ridiculous, which is, as I say, that’s fake news and CNN is fake news like crazy, and they had just totally the wrong story, which they knew. They were asked to change it and they wouldn’t do that and it was a fall. So I’ll ask Dr. Redfield who is a real professional to come up and explain. Please. Thank you, Doc.
Dr. Redfield: (04:16)
Thank you Mr. President. I really do think it’s important to clarify this as we build the confidence of the American people. When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility that the next fall and winter could be more difficult, more complicated. When we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time, influenza and the coronavirus-19, but I think it’s really important to emphasize what I didn’t say. I didn’t say that this was going to be worse. I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated, because we’ll have flu and coronavirus circulating at the same time.
Dr. Redfield: (04:59)
I want to emphasize that we continue to build the nation’s public health infrastructure to ensure that we have the capacity to stay in the containment mode. Those of you who heard me talk before, I’ve told you that in January and February, up to February 27, 28, this nation had 14 cases. We were in the containment mode. And then unfortunately, the virus overwhelmed where we got into extreme mitigation.
Dr. Redfield: (05:23)
We are building that public health capacity now to make sure that we stay in the containment mode for the upcoming fall and winter seasons, so we will not need to resort to the kind of mitigation that we had to this spring.
Dr. Redfield: (05:37)
I have confidence in our public health response of early case recognition that we’ve talked about, isolation and contact tracing, combined with our plans for increased surveillance, particularly for the most vulnerable, will be an effective of public health strategy, so our nation will be able to maintain itself in the containment mode. Again, that will be supported by the American public’s continued cooperation, obviously in the areas of personal hygiene and the types of social distancing strategies that may be appropriate.
Dr. Redfield: (06:12)
The key to my comments and the reason that I really wanted to stress them was to appeal to the American public to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence. One of the greatest tools we have as we go through the fall, winter season that we’re into is to get the American public to embrace the influenza vaccine and thereby minimize the impact the flu to be the co-respiratory disease that we confront. Thank you very much.
Crowd: (06:42)
[crosstalk 00:06:42].
Speaker 1: (06:42)
Can I ask a follow up on that, Dr. Redfield, please?
Crowd: (06:42)
[crosstalk 00:06:48].
Donald Trump: (06:47)
I don’t know what to follow up. He was misquoted, totally misquoted. He said they could come together. They didn’t talk about that. And his whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot. So that next fall we don’t have such a big season of flu and we possibly won’t. But as you said this, it’s possible if the corona even comes back, and he doesn’t know that it’s going to or not. We spoke at great length and I think the doctor will speak, if he’d like to continue, but we may have some embers and we’re going to put them out of corona, but we may have a big flu season, but that’s different. Flu is very different from corona.
Speaker 1: (07:24)
Can I ask you a follow up question [inaudible 00:07:25]?
Donald Trump: (07:25)
Yeah, go ahead. Sure.
Speaker 1: (07:27)
Okay, so Dr. Redfield, the Washington post, which you did the interview with them, they quoted you as saying there’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. And when I’ve said this to others, they’ve kind of put their head bark, they don’t understand what I mean. We’re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time. Is that what you sent to The Washington Post?
Dr. Redfield: (07:51)
Yeah, that’s what I was trying to say to you just a minute ago, that the issue that I was talking about, about being more difficult, is that we’re going to have two viruses circulating at the same time. This spring, that we just went through, February, we had a benefit of having the flu season ended so we could use all our flu surveillance systems to say, “Whoops, this is coronavirus, we need to focus.” Next fall and winter, we are going to have two viruses circulating and we’re going to have to distinguish between which is flu and which is the coronavirus. And so the comment that I made, it’s more difficult. Doesn’t mean it will be more impossible, doesn’t mean it’s going to be more, as some people have said, worse, it just means more difficult because we have to distinguish between the two.
Dr. Redfield: (08:38)
And what I was wanting to do and what I want to do again here is appeal to the American public to recognize they can really help like they did with mitigation, which they really helped. I need them to help now to best prepare us by getting the flu vaccine and taking flu out of the picture.
Donald Trump: (08:53)
But that quote … Excuse me, excuse me.
Donald Trump: (08:57)
We may not even coming back, just so you understand. Doctor, would you like [inaudible 00:09:01]?
Speaker 1: (09:02)
But that quote that I just read was accurate, right sir? That’s the quote from the Washington Post. You were accurately quoted. Correct?
Dr. Redfield: (09:07)
I’m accurately quoted in The Washington Post, as difficult.
Speaker 2: (09:13)
But the headline was [inaudible 00:09:13].
Donald Trump: (09:13)
What does the headline say? Read the headline.
Speaker 1: (09:16)
The headline says CDC director warns second wave of coronavirus is likely to be even more devastating. And isn’t that kind of what he says?
Donald Trump: (09:25)
That’s not what he said.
Speaker 1: (09:25)
But if you have the two things happening-
Donald Trump: (09:29)
The headline doesn’t cover the [inaudible 00:09:29] story.
Dr. Redfield: (09:29)
No, I actually think it’s actually going to be … I think the American public is going to heed the request to re-look at their vaccine hesitancy, to vaccine with confidence for flu. And I’m confident that the public health infrastructure that we’re putting together now across this country, so that we can early case diagnose, isolate and contact trace, as I say, block and tackle, block and tackle. That system is going to be there and we’re going to be able to contain this fire.
Crowd: (09:55)
[crosstalk 00:00:10:00].
Speaker 3: (10:00)
Why did you retweet the article if it was inaccurate, Doctor? Why did you retweet it?
Donald Trump: (10:01)
You weren’t [inaudible 00:10:05].
Speaker 4: (10:04)
We talked about this yesterday when you asked me this question and someone, I think, used the word devastating. And I want to really, again, emphasize to the American public that when we first interacted with this virus for the first time in the February and March timeframe, we didn’t have an understanding of its transmissibility, all of its symptoms. We do now and I think what we are building together and that when we talk about the public health infrastructure, it is very much working on the surveillance piece. But I think we also know the strength of the American people and their ability to immediately understand how to protect themselves with not touching their face, making sure that they’re washing their hands, but the other piece I wanted just to talk about, and we mentioned yesterday also, that we have the summer while we have flu surveillance that we can utilize and syndromic management that we can utilize.
Speaker 4: (11:01)
We have all of that time to prepare clearly the testing algorithm that you would need in a flu, potentially, if COVID came back, potentially. And so we are preparing for that potential right now. And I think we spoke to you all about that and talked about how we’re not only preparing for today and tomorrow, but we’re preparing for six months from now, three months from now, and making sure that all of these pieces are in place. I think what Dr. Redfield clearly was asking for, just like we ask for every American to follow the guidelines, he’s saying, “Please add to that guidelines, getting your flu shot and making sure you’re protected.”
Donald Trump: (11:42)
And [inaudible 00:11:43], everybody says there’s a good chance that COVID will not come back.
Speaker 4: (11:47)
We don’t know-
Donald Trump: (11:47)
And if it does come back, it’s in a very small confined area that we put out. Go ahead.
Speaker 4: (11:50)
Well, the great thing is we’ll be able to find it earlier this time and I think that’s what we’re talking about. We’ll find those cases earlier. So what Dr. Redfield said, we would be able to stay in containment phase. And what we’re also hoping, and we talked about this about four or five weeks ago, that we’re hoping that the flu infections also go down, because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves. Want you to get your vaccine, but we also want to also protect individuals from getting the flu, because the vulnerability we know in certain populations to flu and the devastating outcomes to flu. We could prevent and decrease both of those things. So I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if potentially the virus comes back.
Donald Trump: (12:48)
And if it comes back, though, won’t be coming back in the form that it was, it will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. But what the doctor was saying, and I spoke to him at great length, he was saying if it should come back together, now you have a flu and you have the embers of corona. But in my opinion, from everything I’ve seen, it can never be like anything that we’ve witnessed right now. Would you say that, [inaudible 00:13:17]?
Dr. Redfield: (13:15)
Absolutely.
Donald Trump: (13:17)
It’s nothing like we’ve talked about. What we’ve just gone through, we will not go through. You could have some embers of corona and you could have a big flu system. And if they combined or if they come together, if they come together it’s not great, but we will not go through what we went through for the last two months. [inaudible 00:13:38].
Jeff: (13:37)
President, I-
Donald Trump: (13:37)
Is that correct, sir?
Dr. Redfield: (13:37)
Right.
Jeff: (13:37)
I understand that the United States will certainly be more prepared in the fall, but how can you say that you know it won’t come back in the same level that it has today?
Donald Trump: (13:47)
What it is estimated, it might not come back at all, Jeff. It may not come back at all. He’s talking about our worst case scenario where you have a big flu and you have some corona. And if it does come back, it’s not going to come back, and I’ve spoken to 10 different people, not going to be like it was. Also, we have much better containment now. Before nobody knew about it. Nobody knew anything about it. We understand it. Now, if we have pockets, a little pocket here, then we’re going to have it put out. It goes out and it’s going to go out fast. We’re going to be watching for it. But it’s all possible. It’s also possible it doesn’t come back at all.
Jeff: (14:19)
I understand the containment, but I don’t understand how you know it won’t come back on a big scale.
Donald Trump: (14:24)
I didn’t say it’s not. I said if it does, it’s not going to come back on anything near what we went through, but you could have a mess where they come at the same time. And if they come at the same time, the flu is not the greatest thing in the world, Jeff. It’s not the greatest thing, either. If they come at the same time, you’ll have them both. But if we have embers of corona coupled with the flu, that’s not going to be pleasant, but it’s not to be what we’ve gone through in any way, shape or form.
Jeff: (14:54)
If you don’t think that it’s going to come back at the same severity as it is right now, why are you still directing that taxpayer dollars you spent on emergency procurement ventilators, tens of thousands of them?
Donald Trump: (15:05)
Because we have to have them for other reasons. Something else could come. I mean, we didn’t know about corona. Now we know about corona, but look at what happened. And now we did have the H1N1 swine flu, we had that. We have other things that have happened. We had various forms of flu, but nothing like what we’ve had here. Nothing at all like what we’ve had here with the virus, but something could happen. I think that the stockpiles, we’re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators right now. Nobody writes about that.
Donald Trump: (15:36)
You know what, the one time all they talked about with ventilators, because you didn’t think it was possible for me to solve that problem. And I solved it and nobody can believe it. I just spoke to world leaders today who desperately need ventilators. They said, “the job you’ve done” … And we’re sending 500 to Mexico, then another 500 to France. We’re sending some to Spain. We’re sending some to Italy. They’re being made by the thousands. And world leaders, I spoke to Prime Minister … I mean, I went through a lot of different calls today, I won’t even tell you, I can give you a list if you want. But I went through a lot of calls to a lot of leaders. Spoke with Pakistan. They would like to have some ventilators. We’re going to get them some ventilators.
Donald Trump: (16:22)
But they all said to me one thing, “It was incredible that you solved the ventilator problem, because that was a big problem.” The testing problem, we’ve done more than any other nation in the world. Go a step further. If you added up the testing of every nation in the world, put them together, we’ve done substantially more than that. You people aren’t satisfied.
Donald Trump: (16:42)
So let’s say we had 350 million people in the United States, let’s say. And if we gave every one of those people a test 10 times, so we give 350 people a test 10 times, the fake news media would say, “Where’s the 11th time? He didn’t do his job. Trump didn’t do his job.” Because you have a lot of bad reporting out there, it’s very sad. And it’s so bad-
Speaker 5: (17:05)
That’s not true.
Donald Trump: (17:07)
You’ll want the leaders are the bad reporters.
Speaker 5: (17:08)
No, that’s not true.
Donald Trump: (17:10)
Let’s get onto another subject. I wanted that to be cleared up. If you want, we can get onto it later, but I want the vice president to speak. But you want to get the news accurately, you ought to write it. If you take a look at what you wrote about the ventilators, and when we became the king of ventilators, we’re making different factories all over for ventilators, by the thousands.
Donald Trump: (17:32)
In fact, Mike got back from Wisconsin. First thing he did, he called up. I said, “How’s it going?” He said, “You’re not going to believe.” He just saw a plant, a factory, where they’re making ventilators. I think I can say the words were unbelievable. He said it was unbelievable what he saw. The quality of the equipment, the professionalism, a tremendous number of … how many workers would you say were there?
Speaker 6: (17:55)
Over 550. We doubled production and are about to triple production.
Donald Trump: (18:01)
Nobody thought this could be done. The fake news was very unhappy that it was done. But you guys don’t ask me about ventilators.
Speaker 5: (18:06)
Who’s unhappy that ventilators are being made?
Donald Trump: (18:06)
Everybody. Because you never mention it, you never mention it. There’s no stories, what a great job we’ve done with ventilators. We’re now supplying ventilators all over the world, because no other country could have done what we did. And you should say that’s a great story. Instead you say, “Trump was slow” or … Slow? We were so fast.
Donald Trump: (18:27)
Plus we put the ban on so much earlier. When Nancy Pelosi, as an example, you don’t say this, when she’s having her rally in San Francisco, in Chinatown, in San Francisco, nobody wants to say that. If we didn’t, and Dr. Fauci said this, if we didn’t close our country to China, we would have been so infected like nobody’s ever seen. When you saw the chart, and we were at the top of the list in terms of success, nobody wrote it. I said, “Is anybody going to use that chart?” Nobody wrote it. In terms of mortality, you saw that. Nobody wrote it.
Donald Trump: (19:01)
Germany and our country, the most successful, in terms of mortality. Nobody wrote it. It would be great if you wrote the truth, but let’s get on with it, because I want Mike to speak and then we’ll take some more questions, on the assumption you’d like to and I think you probably will.
Donald Trump: (19:16)
It’s been encouraging to watch states begin to open up. And it really has been, it’s a beautiful thing to see. As restrictions are lifted, we must maintain vigilance and continue practicing social distancing. I encourage governors to follow a careful phased approach and I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines, very important. The governors are going to adhere hopefully, or they’re going to do what they think is best. I want them to do what they think is best, but ideally they’ll adhere.
Donald Trump: (19:49)
Wash your hands, avoid close physical contact as much as possible, and wear a face covering when distancing is impractical, there are cases. We’ve flattened the curve and really made tremendous progress, but we must guard against a dangerous rebound. We don’t want to rebound. That’s so important. This is what we’re just talking about. We don’t want a rebound. The doctor doesn’t want a rebound. These people definitely don’t want a rebound. I don’t think you want one, do you? You, especially. We don’t want rebounds after all this death, death that we’ve suffered. Not work, I don’t view it work, I view it death that was unnecessary, should have never happened, should have never left that little area where it started. You know it, and I know it, and they know it.
Donald Trump: (20:35)
In our all out war against the virus, we continue to make great strides on testing, famous testing, doing more than anybody else anywhere in the world. Nothing funny about that, John.
Donald Trump: (20:48)
Most of the governors have never faced a situation like this before, but we’re helping them find unused testing capacity within their states. Tremendous testing capacity that the governors, in many cases, didn’t know they had. And additional capabilities are coming online every day. We’re coming up with new equipment, like the laboratory’s equipment. On site, five minutes, great success. Everybody wants it, but you can only make so many of those machines. So we have many other forms of testing. We have many other machines that do it very quickly and by the millions, by the millions. Our task force issued it’s reopening guidelines earlier than April 30th to give governors the time that they needed to develop testing capability and capacity, and customized plans for their states, which many of them did. We’ve had some governors do a fantastic job on testing and on a lot of other things. I spoke, as you know Governor Cuomo was here, we had a great conversation on testing yesterday and they’re doing a really good job in New York.
Donald Trump: (21:56)
We’re working very closely with each of the states to help them succeed. I spoke earlier today with Governor Newsom, California, and that was all about testing, that conversation. He’s been scaling up really well, really good job. Then I agreed to help him get some of the critical supplies that California needs to make use of the tremendous capacity that they found. This is a tremendous testing capacity and I’m going to do it very quickly. He needs certain things. We’re going to get that to him very quickly. Now, could he get it himself? Yes, but I can get it faster. He understands that, and he’s done a great job. And we’re going to have it to him, we’re going to have a lot of it to him, over the next two days and we’re going to beef it up the following weekend. Get him a lot of additional. He’s done a really terrific job in California. Some of the governors have done a fantastic job, working with us.
Donald Trump: (22:49)
I told the governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, that I disagree strongly with his decision to open certain facilities, which are in violation of the phase one guidelines for the incredible people of Georgia. They’re incredible people. I love those people. They’re great. They’ve been strong, resolute. But at the same time, he must do what he thinks is right. I want him to do what he thinks is right, but I disagree with him on what he’s doing, but I want to let the governors do. Now if I see something totally egregious, totally out of line, I’ll do. But I think spas, and beauty salons, and tattoo parlors, and barber shops in phase one, we’re going to have phase two very soon, is just too soon. I think it’s too soon.
Donald Trump: (23:43)
And I love the people. I love those people that use all of those things. The spas, and the beauty parlors, and barber shops, tattoo parlors, I love them. But they can wait a little bit longer, just a little bit, not much, because safety has to predominate. We have to have that.
Donald Trump: (24:03)
So I told the governor very simply that I disagree with this decision, but he has to do what he thinks is right. I’m excited to announce that in the coming weeks, the Air Force Thunderbirds are incredible, and the Navy Blue Angels, equally incredible, will be performing air shows over America’s major cities and some of the cities that aren’t major cities. They’re going to be doing a lot of work, a lot of very dangerous flying. It’s dangerous. You know the odds when you start going at massive speeds and you’re 18 inches away from each other, it’s dangerous work. Your son is a great pilot and I don’t know if he could be … Could he be a Thunderbird? I don’t know.
Speaker 7: (24:49)
We’ll see.
Donald Trump: (24:50)
I think he probably could, from what I hear. I don’t know if I’d want him to be, because it is, it’s incredible what they’re able to do and to sacrifice. Our front line, what we’re doing is we’re paying tribute to our front line. Healthcare-
Donald Trump: (25:03)
We’re doing is we’re paying tribute to our frontline healthcare workers confronting Covid. And it’s really a signal to all Americans to remain vigilant during the outbreak. This is a tribute to them, to our warriors. Because they are equal warriors to those incredible pilots and all of the fighters that we have for the more traditional fights, that we win. And we win and we want to win, we always win. Sometimes we don’t want to win, so we just go to a standstill. But that’s not the way this country works.
Donald Trump: (25:37)
Operation America Strong was the idea of our great military men and women, the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels crews, who wanted to show support to the American medical workers who just like military members in a time of war are fiercely running toward the fight. It’s going to be great, I want to see those shows. I’ve seen them many times and I can’t get enough of them. And on July 4th we’ll be doing what we had at the mall. As you know, we’re going to be doing it. Last year was a tremendous success and I would imagine we’ll do it, hopefully, I can use the term forever. That was a great success, as you remember. Even though it was pouring, it was raining so hard. It was raining about as hard as I’ve seen in a while, but it was an amazing success. Didn’t bother the pilots, didn’t bother the military, didn’t bother the crews that we had there. So we’re going to be doing that again on July 4th.
Donald Trump: (26:33)
Our great military is operating at 100% during this crisis and thousands of troops are deployed alongside of civilians and the Covid hotspots, as you know, you see them all over. When I spoke with Governor Cuomo, and when I spoke to Gavin Newsom and many of the other governors, they wanted to know if we could have some military help with the medical. And we gave it to them. And in every case they said, “Fantastic.” I mean, just fantastic.
Donald Trump: (27:04)
New York City Mayor de Blasio called me to say it was inspiring to watch. He was there when the military came in. He said it gave everybody spirit, when he saw the professionalism and the spirit that they had. They walked in and they helped a lot of people, doctors, nurses, respiratory technicians and professionals. It was an incredible thing. But everybody that saw them going to work said that was something special. So we’re going to have some tremendous air shows all throughout our country. That’s in honor of what we’re all going through together and the people that are helping us so much. And, unfortunately, the people who have passed away from something that should never have been allowed to happen.
Donald Trump: (27:51)
Following around-the-clock negotiations yesterday, the Senate answered my call to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program so that millions of additional American workers can keep getting a paycheck. We just increased it by $310 billion. I urged the house to pass the bill without delay. In our first round of funding we provided nearly $350 billion and it went at record speed to American workers and small businesses. It’s really been an incredible, incredible success. I want to thank the banks. We had the big banks, the little banks, the commercial banks of all kinds. Community banks were fantastic, by the way, community banks.
Donald Trump: (28:41)
As you know, this was an interesting story, in recent days I’ve called for Harvard, that’s Harvard University, which has a $40 billion endowment fund to return the money that it was allocated under the CARES Act. I’m pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds. Nor will Stanford University, or many of the others that were involved both on a university level also on a company level. Some of the companies were bigger than people had represented, or bigger than people had thought, and a strong enough that they didn’t need the money. So, there’s a certain amount of money that we are not sending.
Donald Trump: (29:28)
As soon as I heard it I said, “Stop funds.” And for the most part I guess they stopped it, Mike, right? They stopped it, they’re not accepting the money and that’s great. So I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford, and I want to thank the other companies in the case. It’s broken differently between colleges and companies, but I want to thank the companies and the other great universities. And there’s some great ones.
Donald Trump: (29:54)
The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday also reserves $30 billion in loans for small financial institutions that serve minority and distressed communities. They’re very important. We’re determined to protect our African American, Hispanic American and minority workers who have been hit so hard by this hidden enemy. My administration is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to address the full spectrum of needs in these communities, supporting both health and economic revitalization. First, my administration is committed to providing the testing that is needed to fight the virus in distressed communities. In the last month alone, we’ve already sent over one point $4 billion to our nation’s 13,000 community healthcare centers. Think of that, 13,000. To increase testing and treatment in the underserved areas, we’re also expanding access to telehealth.
Donald Trump: (30:51)
Telehealth has become a big deal. You know, I’ve been reading about it for years and all of a sudden because of this it’s become a big thing. People can’t leave their houses, they didn’t want to leave their houses for various reasons including they wanted to follow the guidelines. The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday, and I want to thank everybody. A great, great vote, great. As you know, it was a unanimous vote. How often do you see that?
Donald Trump: (31:17)
The legislation passed by the Senate yesterday includes an additional $25 billion to further expand testing, and provides even more funding for community health centers, in various forms of epidemics and pandemics. We’ll be working on that, because as per a couple of your statements and questions before, we want to work on that for the future. We hope this doesn’t happen again for… Again ever. But last time of this magnitude, 1917. That’s a long time ago. So we want to be prepared, and we are prepared. And as I told you, we’re building up not only our stockpile, which is being built up greatly, but also hospital stockpiles. We’re getting them what they need. We’re working out cost arrangements with them. And we’re getting them a lot of the ventilators, which are the hardest thing for them to get, both from a cost standpoint and a technical standpoint.
Donald Trump: (32:16)
At the same time, we’re also supporting the establishment of new testing sites focused on these communities. 40 sites have launched so far and there are plans to launch dozens more in the next three weeks. We’re coming up with testing apparatus and testing plans that are incredible when you look at the numbers. Some people are very, very big on testing. I’m big on testing, but some people are much less big than I am, I will tell you. And they’re professionals. But we want to have it so that nobody can talk about, “Gee whiz, I wish we had more testing.” Nobody’s done it like we’ve done it and nobody will, and we’re getting very much stronger. We have incredible professionals doing it. So many different tests have not evolved, people are finding it even hard to believe.
Donald Trump: (33:07)
My administration is working closely with governors to ensure that they have the testing infrastructure in place to reduce further spread of the virus, if they’re so inclined to use the testing apparatus. Including strategies for older individuals, low-income Americans, minorities, and native Americans.
Donald Trump: (33:28)
As part of the effort, the White House Task Force headed up by Mike, who has done incredible… I’ll say it every time, I’ll say it to anybody that wants to listen. Mike Pence has done an incredible job, really an incredible job. Thank you… Is providing technical assistance to all 50 States through one-on-one phone calls as they develop and implement their plans. In addition, my administration’s committed to restoring Black and Hispanic communities to full economic health. They want to be healthy economically and physically, and that’s what we’re doing. To that end, today I’m directing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council led by Secretary Ben Carson to focus its effort on supporting underserved communities impacted by the Coronavirus. Ben Carson is working on that with Mike and myself, and a lot of other people. I’m going to ask Tim Scott, who was so helpful with the Opportunity Zones, it’s an economic answer to a lot of problems. Tim Scott was fantastic and so I’m going to ask him to get involved with you. I’m sure he’ll be willing to do it from South Carolina.
Donald Trump: (34:39)
I also asked the council to identify what additional funding will be required from Congress beyond what has already been provided. We’re really building ourself a strong base and we’re building ourself a wall that’s a very different from the kind of walls that you’ve been hearing me talking about. But nevertheless, in many ways, performs the same function and hopefully it’s going to perform it equally as well. Furthermore, the council will seek input from the private sector and community leaders on how we can best support minority and distressed communities.
Donald Trump: (35:13)
As President, I’m absolutely determined to deliver a great future for Americans of every race, religion, color, and creed. Before our nation was attacked by this horrible enemy, our African American, Hispanic American citizens were prospering like never before. Best employment numbers, ever. Not only African American, Asian American, Hispanic American. Every American. We were breaking records at every level. We had almost 160 million people employed. We were never even close to that number. And we were also breaking them economically, highest stock market numbers, highest numbers of every kind. And I think we’re going to be back there, and I think it’s going to be much sooner rather than later. And, I think we’ll surpass those numbers including our employment numbers.
Donald Trump: (36:06)
But I’ll not rest until that prosperity has been fully restored and again, I really believe that we’re going to lift those numbers higher than ever before and it won’t be as long as people might think. A lot of very smart people are looking at that and they’re betting, you just have to look at what’s going on with the stock market.
Donald Trump: (36:25)
In order to protect our great American workers I’ve just signed an Executive Order temporarily suspending immigration into the United States. This will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens. Crucially, it will also preserve our healthcare resources for American patients. We have to take care of our patients. We have to take care of our great American workers, and that’s what we’re doing. I’ve just signed it just before coming into the room, very important. And as to amending it or extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time. But it’s now signed.
Donald Trump: (37:09)
Earlier today, the First Lady and I planted a tree on the South Lawn of the White House in recognition of the 50th Annual Earth Day. I was glad to announce that we will begin to reopen our national parks and public lands. We want Americans to be able to satisfy and be really safe. We want them to satisfy their family that safety is going to happen. And it will happen. Maybe even at a level like never before, we’ve learned so much. But we want them to enjoy these great national treasures as we continue to take reasonable precautions, and hopefully it’ll be just reasonable.
Donald Trump: (37:49)
My administration has directed more than $7 billion in federal funding to support the development of treatments, diagnostics, and therapies. And that’s something, doctors, I hope you can really work on. It’s something so powerful and so important. The FDA, the NIH and industry leaders are establishing master clinical trial protocols to test multiple promising new drugs at the same time. And we’re doing a lot of testing right now. More than 1600 locations across the country have signed up to administer convalescent plasma to patients, infusing them with antibodies of those who have recovered. And when they recover, I said it last time, practically the first thing they say is, “I want to give my blood so that I can help other people.” They want to give that blood. It’s incredible. They’re laying in bed, they’re still in pretty weakened conditions and they say, “I want to give my blood.” And that’s happening all the time, isn’t it?
Donald Trump: (38:50)
If you recovered from the Coronavirus, I ask you to consider contacting your local blood or plasma donation center to arrange a donation that could potentially save many lives. We have love for our nation and loyalty for our fellow citizens. We will safeguard our families, care for our neighbors, heal the sick, protect our workers, and build a future for a country that is the greatest country anywhere in the world. And we’re only going to get greater. Thank you, very much. Mike Pence, please.
Mike Pence: (39:25)
Thank you, Mr. President. White House Coronavirus Task Force met today. And despite the fact that there’ve been more than 843,000 Americans who contracted the Coronavirus and we grieve the loss of more than 47,000 of our countrymen, according to Dr. Birx and her team, we continue to see encouraging signs. Because the American people had been putting into practice the guidance that’s been issued by the President and this task force, and they’ve been taken to heart and the guidance of state and local officials. And Mr. President as we learned today, we are continuing to see declines in all the major metro areas around the country that had been most impacted.
Mike Pence: (40:16)
Numbers remain low and steady on the West coast, in Washington State and in California. The New York metro area, New Jersey, Connecticut all appear to be past their peak. And as our scientists may reflect in a few moments, we also are seeing the positive rate going down. Which is, actually, even as encouraging as the declining cases. The Detroit metro area appears to be past its peak. Seattle metro area, as I mentioned, remains stable. New Orleans metro area is the most stable of all the large metro outbreaks. We also are continuing to see a stabilization and even declines in Houston, and Atlanta, and Nashville, and Baltimore, and Indianapolis, and elsewhere.
Mike Pence: (41:03)
This is a tribute to the American people. To the fact that the American people have taken to heart the guidelines, the social distancing, the personal hygiene, the recommendation that you use the drive through at a restaurant rather than going in a restaurant, and avoiding groups of more than 10. On the President’s behalf, on behalf of our entire White House Coronavirus Task Force, we just want to urge all of the American people to continue onward.
Mike Pence: (41:31)
We all want to reopen America, and we want to reopen our States and our communities as soon as it is safe and responsible to do so. But I want to say to my countrymen, the fastest way to reopen America is to continue to do what you’ve been doing. It’s the fastest way, as President Trump has said many times, to get our country working again is to put the coronavirus in the past. And we are on our way to doing just that.
Mike Pence: (42:01)
Early on, the President called forth not only the full power of the Federal Government, but he called forth the full weight of the American economy. And I had the privilege yesterday to travel to Madison, Wisconsin, and see American industry and American workers at their very best. I want to thank the GE Healthcare team in Wisconsin, as well as the union machinists that I spent time with all day yesterday. It was extraordinary, Mr. President, earlier this month you used the Defense Production Act to ensure that supplies could flow to GE, and General Motors, and Ford, and other companies that were prepared to repurpose manufacturing lines and hire new workers to construct ventilators.
Mike Pence: (42:48)
At this particular plant, the Machinist Union sat down and in less than one week negotiated a new contract with GE Healthcare that allowed them to begin to bring in workers from around the country. They doubled their work line in one a week. They’re about to triple it. They’ve been going 24 hours a day, three shifts, seven days a week. And the President promised that by harnessing the power of the American economy we would have 100,000 ventilators in 100 days. But thanks to the ingenuity and the hardworking Americans that I was with yesterday and other companies, we’re actually going to have 110, 000 ventilators in 100 days. They were all wearing T-shirts, Mr. President, I brought one back for you that simply read, “Union Machinist’s Save Lives.” To that great team of GE Healthcare I want to just say all of America is proud of you and grateful for you.
Mike Pence: (43:47)
We’re also grateful to all of our healthcare workers at every level and all the work that they’re doing. And we’re proud that our National Guard and our American military are at their side. As our task force learned today, more than 31,000 National Guard have been stood up around the country. The President, in the last day, extended what’s called Title 32 Authorizations for all National Guard personnel through May 31. So we’re going to continue to partner with States as the National Guard plays a vital role in testing and in cleaning nursing homes and in standing up state’s response. Military personnel, Mr. President, we have more than a 5,500 active duty military personnel. Including, as of yesterday, 964 medical professionals in the uniform of the United States working in 17 hospitals in 7 States around the country.
Mike Pence: (44:40)
We’re also very proud of our team at the VA. The VA has addressed its capacity issues. It’s not seen cases among the veterans in its facilities increased so they’re deploying teams to focus on nursing homes. In Massachusetts, the VA personnel have disinfected two different nursing homes. In New Jersey, they’ve literally taken over two State nursing homes and deployed 90 doctors and nurses. And, in Florida we’re sending 16 teams to assist in nursing home operations.
Mike Pence: (45:13)
As the President also mentioned, in addition to what I saw yesterday in Madison, Wisconsin, we continue to build our strategic national stockpile. It’s growing again with ventilators, nearly 11,000 in supply. 901 new ventilators will be added, transitioned, in the near term. Every American, I think, can be confident that should the need arise for your family member facing serious consequences from the coronavirus to need that equipment to help them breathe, that equipment will be there. As we said yesterday in Wisconsin, and you’ve said Mr. President, I think it should be a great source of comfort to every American that no American who has required a ventilator in the United States has been denied a ventilator. And that’s a testament to our healthcare workers. A testament to every American putting mitigation principles into practice. And it’s a testament of these great companies.
Mike Pence: (46:15)
Speaking of great companies, American businesses are stepping up. It was on April 1st that I traveled to a Walmart distribution center and the President reached out to the president and CEO of Walmart to ask Walmart to get in the gowns business. And Mr. President, I’m glad to report to you that we heard today at the task force that Walmart is producing 8.4 million gowns, and they will be delivered into our commercial supply to healthcare facilities around the country by the end of June. They’re hardly alone. Honda is producing 500,000 face shields. New balance is making 100,000 masks a week.
Mike Pence: (46:55)
In a very real sense, the American people have stepped up to make the sacrifices and endure the hardship that social distancing has required. But American businesses at every size and every means have come together to respond to the President’s call.
Mike Pence: (47:12)
It really has been a whole-of-America approach. Our message from the President’s White House Coronavirus Task Force is to tell the American people it’s working, we’re getting there. We can see light at the end of the tunnel. We can see the data that we can reopen and put America back to work. But it’s going to take all of us continuing to make the sacrifices necessary, to practice those disciplines, to get us to a place where we can reopen safely and confidently. With that, Mr. President, I’ll call Dr.Fauci up for his reflections and then we’ll move on.
Donald Trump: (47:47)
Great.
Dr. Fauci: (47:51)
Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. I’m going to just take off from where I was at this podium a few days ago. To reiterate some of the things that the Vice President said, but to connect the dots from where we were, where we are now, and where I think we’re going to be. So, you remember a couple of weeks ago when we talked about the fact that we were going to have a really bad week because the deaths, particularly driven by the situation in New York, were going to get worse and worse. But yet, as that was happening, we were starting to see some turnaround, some flattening, and some coming down. As you’ve heard from Dr. Birx, and will likely hear more, that is continuing. What has happened is that the mitigation that we put in with the first 15 days, and then the 30 day mitigation program of physical distancing, worked. It got us to where we are today. It is a successful formula. It is the basis for our being able to say that we can now think seriously about reopening America. And for that reason we put together a carefully thought out and, I believe, well delineated and described program for opening up America again. And you know what it is, it’s the guidelines that we announced a few days ago. Those very guidelines are based on a version of the successful formula that got us to where we are.
Dr. Fauci: (49:26)
So what I’m trying to say, is that the program is not one that is going to be, “Turn the lights on in America, we’re finished.” We’re not. We have to proceed in a very careful, measured way. And if you look at the guidelines, they are careful and they are measured. There are certain checkpoints, before you can even think about going into a Phase One. And then things relax a little as you go into Phase Two. And relax a little, and you go into Phase Three. Now we live in a big country and it’s heterogeneous, and there are different dynamics of outbreaks in different-
Dr. Fauci: (50:03)
And it’s heterogeneous and there are different dynamics of outbreaks in different parts of the country. So, the speed with which one can go from one to another, at the point at which you can even begin to think about the phase, is going to different. So, the one thing that I know, the urge we all have to get out there and get it over with. Let’s get back to normal, for a lot of good reasons because there’s a lot of suffering, economic and otherwise in this country because of that. But again, as I’ve pleaded early on weeks ago, I plead with the American public, with the governors, with the mayors, for the people with responsibility. Although, I know one has the need to leapfrog over things, don’t do that. Do it in a measured way. This is a successful formula. The problem is if we don’t do that, there is a likelihood that we’ll have a rebound. And the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we can’t take care of. So, please again, let me just close by pleading with the American public in general and those who are responsible leaders to carefully consider how we get back to normal. Thank you.
Speaker 8: (51:13)
Dr. Fauci, could you talk a little bit about your expectations for the fall? We heard from Dr. Redfield and Dr. Birx. What do you see for the Fall? Is it going to be embers or possibly no return to the virus at all?
Dr. Fauci: (51:24)
As I’VE said before here, when you look at an outbreak, it’s two dynamic forces opposing each other. If you leave the virus to its own devices, it will take off if you do nothing to stop it. If you put into place the kinds of things that we talk about. First, containment and then hopefully you never get to mitigation but containment is important. Those two forces are going to determine whether you’re going to have a big outbreak. So, what Dr. Redfield was saying first of all, is that we will have coronavirus in the Fall. I am convinced of that because of the degree of transmissibility that has the global nature. What happens with that will depend on how we’re able to contain it when it occurs. And what we’re saying is that in the Fall we will be much better prepared to do the containment compared to what happened to us this winter. Now, the complicating issue is that unlike the syndromic and influenza-like observances that we have, that you could pick it up by clinically what’s happening. It’s going to get complicated by influenza season. And I believe that’s what Dr. Redfield was saying, that is going to be complicated. So, whether or not it’s going to be big or small is going to depend on our response, and that’s what I think people sometimes have misunderstanding. Nobody can predict what is going to happen with an outbreak, but you can predict how you’re going to respond to it. And that’s really very important.
Speaker 8: (53:11)
So, you would caution against people thinking that in the Fall there’s not going to be coronavirus anymore. We won’t have to worry about it or if it is, it’ll be spotty and it won’t be a big problem we have to worry about.
Dr. Fauci: (53:23)
There will be coronavirus in the Fall. If we do, which we won’t, but let’s take an imaginary period. We say, okay, coronavirus, forget about it. We’re not going to do anything about it. It will take off. That’s what viruses do, but that’s not what’s going to happen. We are going to respond to it to not allow it to do that.
Speaker 12: (53:41)
Dr. Fauci, what happens when governor’s like governor Kemp are not following this careful measured plan and moving forward even without meeting the gating criteria? What do we do about that?
Dr. Fauci: (53:55)
Well, if I were advising the governor, I would tell him that he should be careful and I would advise him not to just turn the switch on and go because there is a danger of a rebound and I know there’s that desire to move the head quickly. That’s a natural human nature desire, but going ahead and leapfrogging into phases where you should not be, I would advise him as a health official and as a physician not to do that.
Donald Trump: (54:24)
Okay? All right, good.
Speaker 9: (54:24)
Thank you, Mr. President. Can you give some details about the executive order? I know that the White House has just released a document that we haven’t had a chance to review it.
Donald Trump: (54:39)
Well, we can talk about that later. It’s an executive order on immigration. We want Americans to have the jobs, we want Americans to have the healthcare. We want to take care of our citizens first, we have to, and it’s a very powerful order. It’s for 60 days. At the end of 60 days or maybe even during 60 days I’ll extend it or not and I’ll maybe change it. I might modify it. Yes?
Speaker 9: (55:02)
[crosstalk 00:55:02] immigrants who are already here, Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (55:02)
Yeah, go ahead, please.
Speaker 9: (55:03)
Immigrants who are already here in the country or immigrants abroad who are already affected, who have a green card trying to get into the country and healthcare workers?
Donald Trump: (55:13)
You’re talking about immigrants that are trying to get it and we’re talking about people, and also by the way, people that are coming in illegally. Now, as you know, because you’ve seen the numbers. Our Southern border is very tight. Hasn’t been this tight in years. It’s being helped by 116, more than that, miles of wall that are going up. I’m trying to get to 450 by the end of the year, 450 miles, and we’ll have 530 miles early next year. And that’s really great, it’s fully funded. We have all the funds and the Army Corps of Engineers is doing a fantastic job. Same people that did you have at Java Center, as you know. They’re doing a fantastic job. So, our Southern border’s very tight for very good reason. We’re also being helped by 27,000 very good soldiers from Mexico, and I want to thank the president of Mexico. He’s been terrific in many ways, including on what we’re doing with COVID. And as you know, we have a very good trade arrangement with Mexico now, which we didn’t have before. So, I want to thank the president of Mexico in particular for the 27,000 soldiers. They’re doing a fantastic job. We want to protect our healthcare.
Speaker 9: (56:21)
For healthcare workers, sir? You want to talk about the exemption for healthcare workers?
Donald Trump: (56:27)
We want to protect our healthcare workers, and that’s one of the other reasons we’re doing this. Yes, John?
John: (56:30)
Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about Rick Bright. He’s the head of the federal agency in charge of getting a vaccine out to Americans once it’s ready. He says he has been pushed out of his job because he raised questions about hydroxychloroquine and some of your directives on that. Was he pushed out of that job?
Donald Trump: (56:47)
I never heard of him. You just mentioned a name. I never heard of him. When did this happen?
John: (56:51)
This happened today.
Donald Trump: (56:52)
Well, I never heard of him. The guy says he was pushed out of a job. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn’t. You’d have to hear the other side. I don’t know who he is. Please?
John: (57:00)
And on the hydroxychloroquine?
Speaker 10: (57:03)
I just wondered, you said by 4th of July you expect people to be on the national mall and we’ll be having a celebration like we did last year.
Donald Trump: (57:09)
Hope so.
Speaker 10: (57:10)
Given what the doctors are just saying, that coronavirus is still going to be out there. Might not be as bad as it is now, but it’s still going to circulating. Is that going to be safe to have that many people in the mall?
Donald Trump: (57:20)
We’re going to probably have 25% of what we had last year. Last year as you know was maxed out. I saw a magnificent picture of Dr. Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year and both of them were maxed out. It was beautiful to see. Beautiful, very similar. This year, most likely we’ll be standing six feet apart. We’ll have to do that in a very interesting way and maybe we’ll even do it greater, so we’ll leave a little extra distance. But if we do that, we’d certainly do that. I don’t see maybe the purpose that we can’t do that, we have to have people… We had tens of thousands. Most of you were there, tens of thousands of people, last year was incredible and it was to an extent an air show. All the different aircraft flying over. We even had Air Force One flying over, so ideally it would be wonderful if we could actually have it as it was last year, and eventually we will have that. I think it’s important to know eventually we are going to have that. The stadiums are going to be the way they’ve been for the last 100 years?
Speaker 10: (58:26)
[crosstalk 00:58:26] able to have.
Donald Trump: (58:26)
Right. I know, but your stadiums as an example, sports, it’s going to be the way they it used to be. I told one of the owners, he said, “Do you think I should take out seats?” I said, “No, you shouldn’t take out seats. We’re going to have it the way it was. We’re going to be back.” This virus will eventually be gone and if it should show up in the Fall, we’re going to put it out very fast. We have great people. We’re going to put it out very fast because we’ve learned a lot about how to deal with this and we’ll put it out very fast. Yeah, please? Just nice and easy to start, thank you.
Speaker 12: (59:00)
You talk a lot about testing capacity and governors agree that that exists, but it’s very different from testing implementation and they are still begging for you to use your full authority to help them get reagents and other things. As you would like to say, what do you have to lose by helping them do that and becoming the king of testing?
Donald Trump: (59:18)
And let me just say, we are thinking of testing already. There’s no country in the world that’s done more. Not even-
Speaker 12: (59:23)
0.2% of the population has been tested. Is that good enough?
Donald Trump: (59:27)
I just said there’s no country in the world that’s done more and we have tests that have already come out that are going to be introduced very shortly that will do it more. My problem is this. I’d say it’s very much of a media trap. Whether we did 2%, 5%, 50% or 100%, it’ll never be enough. No matter what. Now, with the expertise and with what we did because of our expertise and tremendous talent at manufacturing. What we did with the ventilators, that wasn’t a trap because we got them done shockingly to everybody because of the incredible talent like Mike Pence saw yesterday in Wisconsin. But we have numerous of those sites all over the country doing the same thing, so that when the governors were complaining, some of the governors, I must say, and it was very much along party lines for the most part except for one, when the governors were complaining, we said, “No. How many do you need?” “We need 50, we need 100.” One governor asks for many thousands and it turned out they didn’t need that and that’s good. We got them and nobody, you know this, and we went through this with the governors, that needed a ventilator didn’t get a ventilator.
Donald Trump: (01:00:41)
That was an incredible achievement. For testing, it’s a little different. It’s much easier than ventilators. It’s like 2%, but for instance the swabs are coming in by the millions. They’re literally coming in by the millions. Totally ordered. We wanted the highest quality. We could have gotten a much lesser quality. We didn’t want to do that. We got the highest quality, but testing, it’s like no matter how well you do, you can always say more. With the ventilators, they either have them or they don’t. In fact, we went to one meeting. “Who wants a ventilator?” One governor said, “We’d like 25.” “25? You got him. Who else?” Nobody spoke up. That was four weeks ago, so that was great. The problem with the testing is, and I said, if we tested 350 million people, you’ll say we want them to have a second test or a third test or a fourth test. Not everybody believes as strongly as some people in testing. Some people want to do testing because they think it’s impossible for us to fulfill that goal.
Donald Trump: (01:01:44)
That’s easy compared to ventilators as I’ve said, but we have a tremendous testing capability. Better than anybody in the world right now and every day it’s growing and it’s growing very substantially. These doctors are very talented people. They’ve seen testing all their lives. They’ve never seen anything like we’ve been able to do, so we’re going to give everybody what they want with the testing. But again, testing, and I’ve said it from the beginning, the actual test has to be administered locally. You can’t do from Washington or far away locations federal testing nearly as well as you can where you have a governor, he has mayors and they have representatives and they know the back of a Walmart. Put it in the parking lot in the back of a Walmart or put it in a certain location in different states. They are doing it beautifully. It’s working beautifully. The relationship I have and Mike has and we all have with the governors, I would say other than one or two, but even them, they don’t complain. They’re not complaining. So, we’re doing tremendous testing and ultimately we’re doing more testing I think than probably any of the governors even want. Okay, please?
Speaker 11: (01:02:55)
Back on the immigration EO, can you say is it just for green card holders or is it also for people seeking temporary work visas?
Donald Trump: (01:02:59)
It’s subject to change. We have some people coming in, for instance, helping the farmers. We want to have the farmers take care, they’ve been coming for years and years and they’re helping our farmers and they’ve been coming in for years. We don’t want to do… The border has been turned off a number of times over the years and you know what happened? Our farmers all went out of business. They were out of business. They couldn’t farm. We’re taking care of our farmers. Nobody ever took care of farmers like I take care of farmers. Including the $19 billion that we’re dispersing to farmers because of some very good things that happened.
Speaker 11: (01:03:34)
Subject to change because some of your advisors are saying there could be a problem with it or subject to change-
Donald Trump: (01:03:39)
No, just it might be modified. It could be modified next week, in two weeks. It could be modified in two months. Now, we may modify as we go along, but right now we have a very powerful immigration ban, but it could be modified, meaning made tougher or made less tough. We don’t want to hurt our businesses and we don’t want to hurt our farmers. Very important. Please.
Speaker 13: (01:04:03)
Can I ask you about your conversation with governor Kemp? What did he say to you when you said you strongly disagreed with him and for gym owners and tattoo parlor artists and barbers in Atlanta and Georgia generally, would you to advise them to listen to you and not to their governor?
Donald Trump: (01:04:18)
Look, I’d like them to listen to their governors, all of their governors. I have the right to do if I wanted to clamp it down, but I have respect for our governors. They know what they’re doing. I think… And as you know, Brian Kemp, governor of Georgia, I worked very hard for his election. He beat their superstar. He beat the superstar of their party. I think you could say I helped a lot. Michelle Obama, Barack Obama, Oprah Winfrey, they all went in. They campaigned for him very hard, and he lost. He also was way down in the primary and ended up winning the primary after I came out and endorsed him. So, a lot of good things and there’s a lot of good feeling between myself and Brian Kemp. I like him a lot. I happen to disagree with him only in time and timing.
Donald Trump: (01:05:04)
I disagree. When you have spas, beauty parlors, and I love these people. I know the people from spas and beauty parlors, tattoo parlors. Bikers for Trump, a lot of tattoos. I love them, I love these people. And barbershops, these are great people, but you know what? Maybe you wait a little bit longer until you get into a phase two. So, do I agree with him? No, but I respect him and I will let him make his decision. Would I do that? No. I’d keep them a little longer. I want to protect people’s lives, but I’m going to let him make his decision. But I told him I totally disagree. Okay?
Speaker 14: (01:05:42)
Thank you, Mr. President. The vice president in his remarks is talking about the federal efforts that have been undertaken as it relates to nursing facilities. And as you both know, they are just so incredibly hard hit. Just tragic. Over 10,000 COVID-19 deaths so far. The industry says that they’re struggling as it relates to testing. Can you commit to increasing testing at the nursing facilities across-
Donald Trump: (01:06:07)
[crosstalk 01:06:07] automatically. That’s almost common sense. But we’re doing that automatically. You look at the state of Washington, that was our first glimpse of it. They got hit so horribly in that nursing home. It just seemed like everybody was from a particular nursing home. So, we knew immediately that was going to be a problem and we’re doing that 100%. we’re taking very special care of our nursing homes and our seniors other than me. Nobody wants to take care of me, but other than me, we’re taking care of our seniors.
Speaker 14: (01:06:36)
In other areas… Thank you, Mr. President.
Mike Pence: (01:06:39)
No, it’s just an enormously important question and we want to thank the American people who have been putting off visits to their grandmothers and grandfathers and moms and dads. It’s tough. I’m going to be in Indiana next week and I’m not going to go see my mom. She lives in her own home, but people get it that the risk of serious illness for a healthy American of the coronavirus is fairly low. You’ll either have flu like symptoms or no symptoms at all, but as we’ve said so many times at this podium and the American people get it, a healthy American could inadvertently convey the coronavirus to a senior with an underlying health condition, and have the kind of heartbreaking results that we’ve seen in nursing homes around the country. It’s the reason why from early on the president took decisive action to raise the infectious disease standards at every nursing home in America.
Mike Pence: (01:07:43)
He deployed all 8,000 of our inspectors at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to dedicate all of their time to ensuring compliance with those new higher standards. We’ve spoken about nursing home issues with governors around the country and frankly there are governors around the country that have done remarkable work with nursing homes. You’ve mentioned governor Brian Kemp. He actually used the National Guard in Georgia. He deployed them to nursing homes to do cleaning and to disinfect areas of those nursing homes and it’s tremendous service. But to your point about testing, if you look carefully at the guidelines, Open Up America Again, you will see that in phase one, the level of testing that we contemplate is first that we want to be able to test anyone who has the symptoms that may be coronavirus and be able to test them quickly. Secondly, we want to do the contact tracing and Dr. Redfield and his team are deploying CDC teams in every state in America to be able to find out everyone that that person has been in contact with and test them.
Mike Pence: (01:08:53)
But if you look right underneath that, what we’re directing states to do is be prepared to deploy testing resources first and foremost in nursing homes and longterm care facilities so that we can monitor any potential outbreak of the coronavirus among the most vulnerable population. And thanks to the leadership of our surgeon general, as the president announced today, we’re also going to be deploying testing resources to vulnerable communities, to underserved communities. The CDC released new preliminary data on the impact particularly on African American communities in this country, and it’s the reason why part of our phase one recommendation is that we deploy testing resources into those communities that are described by the doctors as socially vulnerable. And even as we speak, we’ll announce next week that we’re already in the process of deploying testing. And so, it’s a good opportunity to remind every American to be especially careful around our seniors, to heed the guidance about avoiding visitations, to protect the health of those who are most vulnerable. But the American people can be assured that from phase one forward all the way through phase three and reopening, we’re going to be helping to guide the states to focus on the most vulnerable, beginning with our seniors with serious underlying health conditions.
Speaker 15: (01:10:33)
Thank you, Mr. president. Commercial labs say that they need to buy new diagnostic machines to be able to double their testing capacity. Your administration has said that there’s enough testing capacity to double overnight. How do you square that difference?
Donald Trump: (01:10:47)
Very easy, they can get new machines if they want, but even if they didn’t we have tremendous testing capability. You take a look at what’s happening in California and New York. Governor Cuomo told us very strongly, he said, “Wow, we have a lot of labs.” That’s a research center of the world. In California too, long conversations, they have tremendous testing capability there too. Now, if they want to increase it, they can increase it, but they have plenty of right now. You saw the maps the other day where we put up the different sites in various states and virtually all states are like that. How about you with the mask?
Speaker 16: (01:11:23)
Yes, and Mr. President, may I actually follow up on those maps from the other day? On Monday, a reporter for a local television station in Miami sent me a question asking if it was possible to get the information on those maps distributed to the media so that local TV stations and newspapers can check on that information? So, if that could be done?
Donald Trump: (01:11:49)
Do you want to do that? Do you want to say something?
Dr. Birx: (01:11:54)
Sorry. Thank you for talking about testing and testing capacity because we have been talking about that for several weeks because we could see and we did a full inventory of every single state and every single laboratory. And I also appreciate you talking about the implementation piece of the testing capacity and it’s complicated. So, we have a team calling every lab and working through the American Society of Microbiology, as I mentioned before, to really work with every lab director to see what the issues are in each laboratory. And I just want to thank administrator Burma who really worked on increasing the funding for this test and uniquely doubling the funding for the coronavirus nucleic acid test, from $50 to $100. To really address some of the issues about laboratory technicians, because sometimes we think these tests run themselves, they don’t. They actually need people to help with the machines.
Dr. Birx: (01:12:56)
So, we were talking about purchasing more machines. We actually need to have additional laboratory technicians to really be able to work all of those machines. And so, it’s lab by lab, state by state, and that’s the dialogue that’s going on now to unlock the full potential of the United States. Maybe the testing would not be needed at this moment, and maybe it is, but we want it also totally available in the Fall if it comes to an issue where we have to distinguish between flu and COVID-19. So, we’re building infrastructure and capacity not only for today but for tomorrow, and really showing a new way to really deal with pandemics and bring testing to scale because the country has never had to do this before. If you look at some of the other countries, they’re struggling with some of the issues from PPE to testing. And so, this is a universal issue, but we’re working on it as a collective to really have a very innovated and integrated way to approach testing.
Donald Trump: (01:13:54)
But without building new, they have tremendous capability.
Dr. Birx: (01:13:58)
And the maps are… I will ask the companies, because obviously it’s proprietary where every single machine is and if you have that machine and five others, maybe you don’t want to let that person know you have five others. It’s like Coke and Pepsi. So, I think we’re working very deliberately to really be able to share those maps. The governors, I can tell you that all of the state governors and the mayors have those maps and the addresses and the type of machine for every single laboratory in their jurisdictions so that they know-
Donald Trump: (01:14:32)
And I believe the governors were not aware that those laboratories were available.
Speaker 17: (01:14:38)
[crosstalk 01:14:38] on the state of California is now partially broken with CDC restrictions on who will get guidance and who should get testing because they want to test people without any symptoms at all in high risk environments like a nursing home. Do you agree with this? Question for Pence, do you agree-
Dr. Birx: (01:14:57)
Well, not only do we agree with it, it was in our guidelines.
John: (01:15:00)
Our guidelines, yeah.
Dr. Birx: (01:15:00)
That was fundamental to our guidelines, and I think we were the first-
Dr. Birx: (01:15:03)
Dr. Birx: (01:15:03)
That was fundamental to our guidelines and I think we were the first group that said testing asymptomatics will be key. We’ve always said that we think that’s a significant contribution to infections, and we went to the places where we thought it was most critical to find cases the earliest. And so, that is where we have asked states, in the guidelines, to start with nursing home, indigenous peoples and people in underserved areas and cities, to really ensure that we’re monitoring for any type… Because we know the asymptomatic piece may be the tip of the iceberg, in fact be the iceberg underneath the surface. And so, if you’re only seeing cases, maybe this…
Dr. Birx: (01:15:41)
But in parallel, we’re working with states and local governments to really define what that population is, by doing… In collaboration with states, working with them together to really reinforce this antibody testing but in a careful way, where you do two antibody testing to increase your sensitivity and specificity into the 99 plus percent range. Because we think it’s really important that you have a very high quality test, but a high quality test that you can really tell someone that they’ve had this before. And so, we’re waiting to have those two tests that we can do in series to really assure people. But that is… That was in the guidelines from the very beginning, and we think it’s fundamental both for right now and going through the fall. Because that will be our early alert, if any of other COVID virus reappears.
Speaker 20: (01:16:28)
How much more testing [crosstalk 00:01:16:29]?
Donald Trump: (01:16:29)
[crosstalk 01:16:29] you didn’t that was on the guidelines.
Speaker 21: (01:16:32)
The CDC [crosstalk 01:16:32] criteria [crosstalk 00: 01:33].
Speaker 20: (01:16:34)
Well, it’s currently on the CDC guidelines, usually-
Donald Trump: (01:16:34)
I know, but it’s right on the guidelines.
Speaker 22: (01:16:37)
Dr. Fauci, why are there… Can I just-
Donald Trump: (01:16:39)
I’m surprised with you. [inaudible 01:16:39] would you like to say something on it, please?
Speaker 23: (01:16:44)
Thank you, Mr. President. And I just want to reiterate to everyone that the task force and the administration have a commitment to protecting vulnerable people. And that includes, in the area of testing. We’ve had the opportunity to talk to many different groups and we hear that testing is absolutely a concern. And we’ll be giving you more details in the coming days, but I just want you to know that we’re building on the public private partnership that the president rolled out with pharmacy and retail companies like CVS, Walgreens, Rite Aid, Walmart and Kroger, to accelerate testing for more Americans and more communities across the nation. We’re going to be increasing access to testing for under-tested, underserved and minority communities, and we’re working closely with partners and states to establish sites and areas most in need of increased access to testing. We’re using data. CDC, provided data to locate sites and counties that are under tested and socially vulnerable, especially with high populations of Black, Hispanic, rural and Native Americans.
Speaker 23: (01:17:49)
We’re using the CDC’s vulnerability index, as you heard about earlier, to select sites. This measures the resilience of communities when confronted by external stressors along four main themes, socioeconomic status, household composition and disability, minority status and housing type. Our goal is to have about two third of these initial sites located in counties with moderate to high social vulnerability, and about a quarter of these sites and counties with high social vulnerability. So again, I want communities that are vulnerable to understand that we are strategically and intentionally making sure we’re deploying testing in those areas, so that people can get identified if they have symptoms, can get identified if they are asymptomatic, and that we will be able to deploy resources appropriately.
Donald Trump: (01:18:39)
Thank you, [crosstalk 01:18:40].
Speaker 22: (01:18:39)
Just a quick follow-up for Dr. Birx.
Donald Trump: (01:18:39)
I’m got to have to say our Surgeon General is doing a great job, thank you.
Speaker 23: (01:18:45)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:18:45)
Really good. [inaudible 00:03:47], in the middle.
Speaker 24: (01:18:48)
Mr. President, thank you. Can we talk about Iran? You put out a message this morning making a rather big announcement for our military when it comes to Iranian aggression. Are you going to change formally rules of engagement for our U.S. military so that they can engage?
Donald Trump: (01:19:08)
We’re covered 100%. We don’t want their gunboats surrounding our boats and traveling around our boats and having a good time, we don’t want them anywhere near our boats, and… So you know the order I gave, I don’t think you have to say it again, but I’ve given that order. Under the Obama administration, it was taking place all the time. Under my administration, I gave this order early on and nothing happened. They were very nice, there was no problem. But then I noticed yesterday they did that in a much lighter form, but they did that again. I said, “We’re not going to stand for it.” So if they do that, that’s putting our ships at danger and our great crews and sailors in danger, I’m not going to let that happen. And we will… They’ll shoot them out of the water.
Speaker 24: (01:19:51)
The U.S. military does not have to change its rules of engagement in order to follow your [crosstalk 00:01:19:56]?
Donald Trump: (01:19:56)
No, that’s the rules of engagement. That’s a threat. When they get that close to our boat, and they have guns, they have very substantial weapons on those boats, but we’ll shoot them out of the water. Please.
Speaker 25: (01:20:07)
Thank you, President Trump. If possible, I’d like to ask a question to Dr. Fauci, and then a very different one to you. To Dr. Fauci, today the CDC and the USDA said that the first pets in America had tested positive for the coronavirus, what does that mean and what should the public know about that?
Dr. Fauci: (01:20:22)
Pets?
Speaker 25: (01:20:23)
Pets, two pets.
Dr. Fauci: (01:20:25)
So that question was asked before, but I’d be happy to answer it again. Certainly, animals, pets, can get infected. Big cats in zoos have been reported to be infected with coronavirus. There’s no evidence that the virus is transmitted from a pet to a human. Now obviously, is that impossible? I mean, biologicall anything is possible. But, there is no evidence whatsoever, that we’ve seen from an epidemiological standpoint, that pets can be transmitters within the household. So, it’s not surprising. I mean, we… When you have viruses that can infect multiple species, isolating it from an animal doesn’t necessarily mean the animal is transmitting it.
Donald Trump: (01:21:10)
What about the lion in the New York zoo?
Dr. Fauci: (01:21:12)
Yeah. Well, that’s the lion [inaudible 01:21:13].
Donald Trump: (01:21:13)
How did that happen?
Dr. Fauci: (01:21:15)
It probably happened… I don’t know, Mr. President. But I would imagine that one of the zookeepers probably had an asymptomatic infection, took care of the animal, gave him some food, touched them or whatever, and that’s how he got it.
Speaker 25: (01:21:28)
Thank you. And President Trump my question for you is, earlier in these briefings you talked a lot about giving Americans hope and you wanted to focus on that, but now that the crisis seems to perhaps be lessening, I wanted to ask you about accountability. And of course, millions of Americans became familiar with you as the tough boss who fired people for doing a poor job. I wanted to ask you about two specific things. There was a report from Reuters today, that the HHS Secretary, put a former dog breeder in charge of day to day coronavirus efforts, to begin with. And also on-
Donald Trump: (01:22:05)
What?
Speaker 25: (01:22:05)
Reuters reported today that, Alex Azar, the secretary HHS, put a former dog breeder, that was his most recently former job, in charge of day to day operations of the coronavirus.
Donald Trump: (01:22:16)
That I don’t about, [inaudible 01:22:18] just telling me something. And what’s the second?
Speaker 25: (01:22:20)
And the second one is on face masks. Taiwan has a bigger population than New York State. Early on, they had universal wearing of face masks. Here-
Donald Trump: (01:22:29)
No problem with face masks, if the governors want to do that. We ordered, I don’t know if you know, 500 million face masks, we have hundreds of millions right now. And if people want to wear them, that’s up to the governors. If the governors want that, that’s up to them. Now it’s more appropriate in some states, obviously, than others. You have the big planes and you have certain states where it’s much less necessary. But, that’s up to the governors and we have that very well covered, I think, face masks, right?
Speaker 25: (01:22:54)
Here, people are wearing masks.
Donald Trump: (01:22:55)
We have hundreds of millions of face masks, and we have at least 500 million, that’s a lot. We’ll have them very shortly.
Speaker 25: (01:23:04)
Lot’s of people are wearing face masks now that the federal government advised, it was almost overnight. But less than a month ago, our Surgeon General said that, and I’m quoting their quote, “Not effective in preventing the general public from catching coronavirus.” I mean, is… Should there be accountability there and also for the HHS Secretary?
Donald Trump: (01:23:23)
Well, I don’t know. Would anybody like to speak about it? I don’t… I think if… Just so you understand, if somebody wants to wear them, I’m all for it. Would somebody like to discuss that?
Dr. Fauci: (01:23:31)
Yes. Go for it, boss.
Speaker 26: (01:23:36)
I think the comments that we made when we came into face masks, and I think it’s important, when we came out with the CDC guidance about face masks or what we called face coverings, was in recognition of the growing understanding of asymptomatic infection or presymptomatic infection, was the recognition that we could use a barrier, and the reason… And I have mine when I’m in public right here, that I use. That this barrier, in case I was in fact infected if I didn’t know, is a barrier to prevent me to protect you in case I happened to be asymptomatically infected. There’s very good data to show that the ability of viral particles to go through a barrier is substantially diminished. And that’s why we recommended these face coverings, I think if you go back to when CDC came out with that recommendation. Some people may think intuitively it’s to protect them from getting infected. No, it was to protect you from potentially getting infected by me when I go out in public. [inaudible 01:24:46].
Donald Trump: (01:24:45)
[inaudible 01:24:47].
Speaker 23: (01:24:50)
I actually appreciate you asking that question because it’s one that we’ve had to clarify several times, and I understand why the American public has been confused over time. As Dr Redfield mentioned, initially we said based on CDC, World Health Organization and most other major public health organizations, that the public needed to know that these masks were not effective or shown to be effective in preventing you if you wear a mask from catching coronavirus. Another important thing to remember in the context of those statements, was a run on medical masks, on N95 masks, and our healthcare workers were at risk. What’s changed? What’s changed is, we found out that unlike past viruses that are spread through the respiratory route, a significant proportion of coronavirus cases can be traced back to asymptomatic spread. So, the task force deliberated this, we’ve always told you that we will look at the facts and we will give people recommendations based on the best available evidence at the time.
Speaker 23: (01:25:51)
And once we saw that asymptomatic spread, we said, “Well, masks still aren’t effective.” And from our point of view, at preventing you from catching coronavirus in a significant way. But we’ve always told people that they should wear masks if they know they have symptoms to prevent them from spreading to other people. Well, now that we know about 25 to 50% of people are spreading asymptomatically, we suggested people wear cloth facial coverings to prevent asymptomatic spread. You wear your mask, to protect me. I wear my mask, and Dr Redfield mentioned it… I’ve got my mask, I believe I have mine on me, Bob. I carry mine around with me too. I wear my mask to protect you. We’re six feet away, which is why I’m not wearing my mask to protect you now. And we also all have been tested, so that’s why I’m not wearing mine now.
Donald Trump: (01:26:41)
Yeah, but I’m still next to you.
Speaker 23: (01:26:41)
Well, I’ll put mine on if you want me to, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:26:43)
[crosstalk 00:11:43].
Speaker 23: (01:26:44)
But again, important to know that if you’re going to wear a mask, it’s not a substitute for social distancing. Still, social distancing is the number one thing you can do. Number two, it’s important to know that you should practice good hand hygiene and not touch your face, because you still could touch a surface and bring disease to your face. And number three, is the most important… Well, it’s just as important. Please, save the medical mask, the N95, for the healthcare workers, because the cloth facial coverings are effective as far as we know right now, based on the best available evidence, at preventing you from spreading disease to other people. So, no inconsistency there. It’s just, the recommendation changed because the information changed, and that’s what you want from your public health leaders.
Speaker 25: (01:27:28)
So, no argument made that you do about asymptomatic transmission at the time that you said that, and that you were essentially misleading the public?
Speaker 23: (01:27:35)
Well, I…
Donald Trump: (01:27:35)
Please answer that question.
Speaker 23: (01:27:38)
The honest answer to you is, no, we did not. That was the recommendation of the World Health Organization and the CDC, and we gave you the best information we could at the time. So, I actually a little bit resent that implication, because I work hard to try to protect the American people and we are always going to give the American people the best information we have available at the time.
Speaker 25: (01:28:01)
And we don’t-
Speaker 23: (01:28:02)
We’re humble enough to say, “look, if we don’t know we’re going to change. We’re going to change with recommendations.”
Donald Trump: (01:28:06)
Just always got a question, that’s all. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 27: (01:28:09)
Mr. President, I wanted to ask you about the launch of the military satellite by Iran, wanted to get your response to that. Do you see this as an advancement of the missile program?
Donald Trump: (01:28:19)
You mean the shot they took? Well, they say no. They say all sorts… It was for television. Does anybody really believe that? They wouldn’t have better television in Iran. So, they said no. We’re watching Iran very closely. We know more about… [inaudible 00:13:36].
Speaker 27: (01:28:38)
Military readiness. The outbreak on the Roosevelt, the fact that you’re consumed with dealing with coronavirus here in the United States.
Donald Trump: (01:28:40)
[crosstalk 00:13:42]. Various navies have had outbreaks of COVID. Look, we’re in 184 different nations right now. 184 with COVID. No, we have a problem on… That just shows you how rapidly it spreads. It started off with two sailors, and then 10 sailors, and 20, and now I hear it’s 540. Of which, one has died and a few were very sick, but most of them are back in great shape. But, you did… We did lose one, and it attacked the lungs of that young person. And then, we also had a number that were quite sick, but they’re all either better or getting better, but most of them are better for a long time already. Please.
Speaker 28: (01:29:22)
Mr. President, can I-
Donald Trump: (01:29:22)
[crosstalk 00:14:25].
Speaker 29: (01:29:23)
Thank you, Mr. President. As you know, over the course of the past few weeks, there have been the closures of several meat processing companies across the country and several states.
Donald Trump: (01:29:34)
Yeah.
Speaker 29: (01:29:35)
Is this a concern to you?
Donald Trump: (01:29:36)
Yeah, of course.
Speaker 29: (01:29:37)
Are you going to increase testing in these facilities [crosstalk 00:14:39]?
Donald Trump: (01:29:41)
Yeah. Look at South Dakota, how well the governor has done there, and all of a sudden you have a big spike in one location and she’s got that very much under control as you know, but nevertheless, that was surprising and they had a big one right near where you were yesterday, as I understand it. And… So, we’re concerned about that. They’re closing one or two of the plants, actually.
Speaker 29: (01:30:00)
Is the food supply secure?
Donald Trump: (01:30:02)
Yes, totally secure. It’s in great shape. At the back [inaudible 01:30:05].
Speaker 30: (01:30:09)
Thank you, Mr. President. [inaudible 01:30:08], the attorney general in the State of Missouri, filed a law case against-
Donald Trump: (01:30:14)
Against China.
Speaker 30: (01:30:16)
… China. Accusing it of lying and covering up about the origin of the virus. Do you support that? And do you [crosstalk 01:30:22] a national-
Donald Trump: (01:30:22)
Well, I haven’t seen the case. I know about the case. He filed the case against China. I love Missouri, as you know, it’s great. But I’m going to take a look at it. I actually know about it very much. I have to take a look at… I have not seen the case in terms of reading it, but I will be doing that.
Speaker 30: (01:30:38)
[inaudible 01:30:38] for international investigation.
Donald Trump: (01:30:40)
We’re going to have to take a look. Oh, we’re doing investigations, we’re doing our own. But I do want to see and review that lawsuit. I’m sure that won’t be the last one.
Speaker 31: (01:30:48)
I just a had follow-up question for Dr. Fauci, if you don’t mind.
Donald Trump: (01:30:51)
Yeah, sure.
Speaker 31: (01:30:51)
But, I’m happy to ask you one after. So, John had asked the president about Rick Bright, and he said he wasn’t sure who that was, but I’m sure you’re familiar with who he is, since he was the head of BARDA. So, there’s concern or an accusation, he’s raised, that he was removed from his job because he protested widespread use of hydroxychloroquine. Are you familiar with this situation? And, do you feel like public health experts feel they are able to speak publicly or to speak out in opposition to certain things?
Dr. Fauci: (01:31:22)
Here I am.
Speaker 31: (01:31:24)
Yeah. So, you don’t feel like there’s any concern among people at the NIH right now or in the public health [crosstalk 01:31:29]?
Dr. Fauci: (01:31:30)
At the NIH? Absolutely not.
Speaker 32: (01:31:33)
Dr. Fauci, knowing Dr. Bright and knowing what his gifts are, as one of the country’s leading experts on vaccines, are those gifts best suited at NIH rather than BARDA? What’s he going to be doing with you?
Dr. Fauci: (01:31:46)
What is he going to be doing at the NIH?
Speaker 32: (01:31:49)
So first of all, are his gifts best suited to work with you rather than BARDA?
Dr. Fauci: (01:31:54)
No, I can’t… I don’t really think I can comment on somebody’s relative gifts. I mean, he’s going to be at the NIH and he’s going to be responsible, from what I hear. Again, this is what I’ve heard, that he’s going to be responsible for the development of diagnostics, which is very important. The NIH is going to be involved in trying to develop new generation diagnostics, which we feel is going to be very important for the future of being able to facilitate the kinds of things that now are sometimes problematic.
Speaker 32: (01:32:26)
Are you concerned at all that he-
Donald Trump: (01:32:26)
And why do you say he has great gifts or gifts? What? Do you know him?
Speaker 32: (01:32:29)
[inaudible 00:17:29].
Donald Trump: (01:32:29)
No, I know. But, have you reviewed him?
Speaker 32: (01:32:31)
[crosstalk 01:32:31] resume, he’s working-
Donald Trump: (01:32:31)
Have you studied him? Have you reported on him? You said his gifts. I mean-
Speaker 32: (01:32:36)
He’s worked his entire career developing vaccines including the [crosstalk 01:32:41].
Donald Trump: (01:32:37)
Well, that doesn’t mean you have gifts. I know a lot of people that play baseball, but they can’t hit 150 in the Major Leagues.
Speaker 32: (01:32:43)
Well, he helped develop the flu vaccine, last year.
Donald Trump: (01:32:45)
No, but you talk about his great gifts. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 33: (01:32:49)
Mr. President, thank you so much-
Donald Trump: (01:32:49)
Please, go ahead. You could go. Please.
Speaker 34: (01:32:51)
Thank you, sir. I have two questions, one for myself and then one for a colleague of ours who could not be here today because of social distancing.
Donald Trump: (01:32:58)
From where?
Speaker 34: (01:32:59)
I’m with, USA today. First, the Executive Director of The National Association of Counties said today, that The White House did not want to see money for local… State and the local governments in the latest COVID assistance package.
Donald Trump: (01:33:14)
[inaudible 00:01:33:14], want to say what? What does that mean?
Speaker 34: (01:33:16)
I’m sorry.
Donald Trump: (01:33:17)
What does that mean? Repeat it. Say it a little differently.
Speaker 34: (01:33:20)
The Executive Director of The National Association of Counties said today, that The White House objected to putting funding for state and local governments into the latest COVID assistance package.
Donald Trump: (01:33:31)
Oh, really. That’s… Is he a Democrat?
Speaker 34: (01:33:33)
I do not know, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:33:34)
Well, check it. How could you ask that question without knowing? Check it out, you’ll find out.
Speaker 34: (01:33:37)
I’ll check it out.
Donald Trump: (01:33:38)
Okay. What’s your next question?
Speaker 34: (01:33:39)
He says… His question was-
Donald Trump: (01:33:40)
You know the numbers, you know the money we put into states, local governments, everything else, and they have to be responsible for their own finances, but you check it out. Go ahead. What’s the next…
Speaker 34: (01:33:50)
[crosstalk 01:33:50] he said that you said that you felt like that this would somehow be a disincentive or [inaudible 01:33:55], is he correct about that?
Donald Trump: (01:33:58)
How would he know what I felt? I never spoke to him. I don’t even know who he is.
Speaker 34: (01:34:00)
[crosstalk 01:34:00].
Donald Trump: (01:34:01)
You don’t know who he is either.
Speaker 34: (01:34:02)
Yes. His name is Matthew Chase, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:34:04)
Okay. It doesn’t help me and it doesn’t help you. Go ahead, Jeff.
Jeff: (01:34:10)
Mr. President, also-
Donald Trump: (01:34:11)
Do we want to keep going [inaudible 01:34:12] or not? You’re not going to say, “Oh, he took questions all night long.”
Speaker 35: (01:34:15)
No, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:34:16)
Okay. Right?
Speaker 36: (01:34:17)
[inaudible 01:34:17].
Donald Trump: (01:34:19)
Okay. Well good, how many questions can you have? Go ahead.
Jeff: (01:34:20)
… also-
Donald Trump: (01:34:21)
We all have fun, because we’re talking about something very important. The main thing is, I think we’re getting to a lot of solutions. We never want this to happen again. We never want this to happen again, what happened. And if it should come back in some form, we want to snuff it out very quickly before anything can happen. And I personally hope it doesn’t come back in the fall, as a combination of the flu or not as a combination of the flu. But I think we learned a lot. And some of these questions are good, some of them are ridiculous frankly, but some of them are very… I think some of them are very important questions. Very important. When you asked Dr. Fauci about the right to speak, if I let him speak, I’ll let anybody speak. And we love him. Let’s go.
Jeff: (01:35:06)
Mr. President, Senator-
Donald Trump: (01:35:07)
[crosstalk 00:20:07].
Jeff: (01:35:08)
…. McConnell said today that he would prefer to see states that have high public pensions declare bankruptcy rather than taking on more federal bailout money.
Donald Trump: (01:35:17)
I heard he said that… I don’t know what he said, I’ll have to call him and ask him.
Jeff: (01:35:23)
That’s what he said.
Donald Trump: (01:35:24)
Well, that’s okay. I’m going to have to look at it directly.
Jeff: (01:35:27)
Would you agree with him on that? Or-
Donald Trump: (01:35:28)
I can tell you that. I have to see… I want to base it on fact and reason. I want to see what he said, why he said it, and how he said it. I’d have to watch him say it. But, some of the states are not doing well, let’s face it. And some are doing phenomenally well, a state where Mike was governor. Indiana, I looked at their numbers, they have… It’s incredible what they’re doing. Some states are doing fantastically well. Iowa is doing great. You have states doing well and you have some states that aren’t doing well. We know the ones… I don’t have to mention the ones that aren’t doing well, but you do have states that are in trouble. And certainly, they’re coming back to talk to us. We’ll see what happens.
Jeff: (01:36:07)
Are you concerned, sir, about the growing US national debt as a result of these stimulus packages?
Donald Trump: (01:36:12)
Oh, we have no choice. Do we have a choice? I’m always concerned about everything. We had to fix this problem. This was… We were attacked. This was an attack. This wasn’t just OG, and this wasn’t the flu, by the way. They like to say the flu. Nobody has ever seen anything like this. 1917, was the last time. We were attacked… We had the greatest economy in the history of the world, we had the greatest economy… Better than China, better than any place, they will tell you that. I dealt with them for a long time and they will you, the greatest economy, we built it in the last three years, three and a half years, we built it. And then one day, they came and they said, “You have to close it.” I said, “You got to be…” These people right here, they said, “You have to… They came into my office, into The Oval Office, and they said, “We have to close the economy.” I said, ” Let’s explain this. Explain this to me.” The greatest ever in history, and we had to close it.
Donald Trump: (01:37:07)
Now we’re going to open it again and we’re going to be just as strong or stronger, but you have to spend some money to get it back open. We saved our airlines. We just as finished up with the airlines. We saved numerous companies that are great companies. That two months ago we’re having the best year they’ve ever had, now all of a sudden they’re totally shut out of markets. There was a great spirit today. The fact is some of the governors are opening up their states. And I saw it, I feel it. I don’t know if you folks know, I feel it. There was a great spirit today. I don’t know, the stock market was up today, I guess. It was up quite a bit when I just walked out here. And I will say, I feel much different today than I did two or three days ago. And I think the world does. We spoke to a lot of leaders. The world feels that we’re really leading a path of optimism.
Donald Trump: (01:38:01)
European Union is having a lot of difficulty. You take a look at what’s going on with the European Union, it’s having tremendous difficulty. But we’re going to be back and we’re going to be back stronger than ever, we’re going to be at a level, I think, that everybody is going to be look… And they do. They look up to us. They want to know, what are we doing? What are we doing with therapeutics? What are we doing with vaccines? We’re going to have those answers too. We’re going to have them. Just like we took care of ventilators, just like we’re taking care of and already, as we said a hundred times, we had more testing than any nation in the world.
Donald Trump: (01:38:33)
We had more testing than all of those nations put together, that we mentioned the other day, all of them put together. And we’re going to be within two weeks at a level that nobody has ever even seen before. They’ve never seen where we are right now. You don’t have to build new machines, you don’t have to build new labs, we already have them. But some of the labs are even upgrading to be able to double and triple their capacity, in one case. Now we’re at a level that nobody has ever been. We’re going to be bigger, better and stronger than ever before. So, I’m not concerned about that. Thank you very much."

5:22 P.M. EDT","Donald Trump: (01:12)
Thank you very much everyone. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:29)
Following the release of our reopening guidelines, governors across the country are looking forward to phase one and announcing plans for an economic resurgence. We’re going to have a resurgence, too. At a time when millions of American workers and families are struggling with the financial consequences of the virus, it’s critical to continue the medical war while reopening the economy in a safe and responsible fashion.
Donald Trump: (01:56)
During this time, Americans must maintain strict vigilance and continue to practice careful hygiene, social distancing, and the other protective measures that we have outlined and that everybody’s become very familiar with. We continue to be encouraged that many of the areas hardest hit by the virus appear to have turned the corner.
Donald Trump: (02:16)
For example, recent deaths are down very, very substantially. You can compare that with their peak not so long ago, and you have numbers of 30%, 25% in Detroit, as an example. It’s down by over 50%. Congratulations. And in New Orleans where they’ve done a terrific job, they’re down 65%. 30 states have just one case or less per 1000 people, far fewer cases per capita as an example than Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland, Singapore, Belgium, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands, Austria, Sweden.
Donald Trump: (02:57)
My administration continues to press Congress to replenish the enormously successful paycheck protection program, which has impacted 30 million American jobs. We hope to have an agreement very soon and hopefully tomorrow the Senate is going to be able to vote. A lot of progress has been made on that, tremendous progress. It’s a great plan. It’s a great plan. It’s helped a lot of people. So we hope to have a vote maybe tomorrow in the Senate.
Donald Trump: (03:24)
And based on the record low price of oil that you’ve been seeing, it’s at a level that’s very interesting to a lot of people. We’re filling up our national petroleum reserves, strategic, the strategic reserves, and we’re looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves themselves. That would top it out. That would be the first time in a long time it’s been topped out. We’d get it for the right price.
Donald Trump: (03:55)
We’re also pushing for the deal to include an additional and visits, elective procedures, surgeries, etc, etc, were canceled. We think that they can all get back online and get it done. The hospitals have really been fantastic. The hospitals, they’ve stepped up to the plate. They’ve really done a great job. We appreciate it so much. For areas less affected by the virus, we’ve issued new recommendations about how to safely resume elective treatments. HHS has also distributed the first $30 billion in direct payments to a million healthcare providers across the country. We’ve also invested $1.4 billion in community health centers to ensure our most vulnerable communities, including many African-American and Hispanic-American communities, have access to the services and testing that they need.
Donald Trump: (04:50)
Earlier today, vice president Pence spoke with governors from all 50 states about our unified effort to defeat the virus. He had a great call. It was a great call, very positive in I’d say every way. Prior to the call, we provided each governor with a list of the names, addresses and phone numbers of the labs where they can find additional testing capacity within their states. Many, many labs. We’re providing you with the list. We’ll show it to you now if you need it. We’ll give you the details, but hundreds and hundreds of labs are ready, willing, and able. Some of the governors, like as an example, the governor from Maryland didn’t really understand the list. He didn’t understand too much about what was going on. So now I think he’ll be able to do that. It’s pretty simple, but they have tremendous capacity and we hope to be able to help him out. We’ll work with them and work with all of the governors.
Donald Trump: (05:46)
Similar to the situation with ventilators, states need to assess their complete inventory of available capacity. Some states have far more capacity than they actually understand, and it is a complex subject, but some of the governors didn’t understand it. The governor, as an example Pritzker from Illinois, did not understand his capacity, not simply ask the federal government to provide unlimited support. I mean you have to take the support where you have it, but we are there to stand with the governors and to help the governors, and that’s what we’re doing and they have a tremendous capacity that we’ve already built up and you’ll be seeing that. We’re going to be introducing a couple of the folks in a little while to talk about it.
Donald Trump: (06:31)
I want to draw your attention to Governor Cuomos remarks during his press conference today. He said, “The President is right. The state’s testing is up. My job to coordinate those 300 labs. I think the President’s right when he says that the states should lead,” and the governors, they’re really getting… They’re getting it together in New York. A lot of good things are happening in New York, and I think the governor is going to come in to see us tomorrow. He’s coming to the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon. Andrew is going to be coming in with some of his people, so we look forward to that.
Donald Trump: (07:07)
Some of the articles that just recently came about, if you remember, and I put out a statement today, for a month it was all ventilator, ventilator, ventilator. It’s all people could talk about was ventilators, and we did a great job with that. We built a lot of ventilators, to put it mildly. We have so many now that at some point soon we’re going to be helping Mexico, and Italy, and other countries. We’ll be sending them the ventilators, which they desperately need. They were not in a position to build them themselves, but we have thousands being built. Every state has had… They have the ventilators. If they don’t, we have almost 10,000 in our federal reserve, our stock pile as they call it, and we did a great job with the ventilators.
Donald Trump: (07:58)
Unfortunately, the press doesn’t cover it other than the fair press, but so then you say, “Gee, they need ventilators. We don’t need ventilators.” And that’s under pressure we did that. Nobody that needed a ventilator in this country didn’t get one. And a story that just came out, How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story, I’m sure you’d love to see that. That’s by Rich Lowery, respected journalist and person. How the Media Completely Blew the Trump Ventilator Story, which unfortunately it did. And here’s another one that just came out. Kyle Smith, The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t. The Ventilator Shortage That Wasn’t because we got it fixed.
Donald Trump: (08:44)
And we’re also going to help the states, by the way, stockpile ventilators so if a thing like this should happen again they’ve got them. The stories on testing are all over the place that we’re actually in good shape. I’m going to have the vice president and others speak to you about that, but we’re in very good shape on testing and we’re getting better all the time. You’re going to see some interesting things.
Donald Trump: (09:07)
I thought before I went any further though, I’d like to have General Semonite, who’s done an incredible job, tell you where we are. We’re still building beds in hospitals for people that need them. I guess the hospital business general is getting pretty much closed out now, but we’re creating a lot of a space for people just in case, and in some cases they probably will be using them. But I thought the general, he’s been so impressive and done such a great job, I thought on behalf of the services and on behalf of the federal government he’d say a few words about what we’re doing right now. Thank you very. General?
General Semonite: (09:48)
Well, thank you Mr. President. I just want you to know that on behalf of all of us in the Department of Defense, our thoughts and prayers go out to all of those patients and all those victims that have been affected by this terrible virus. And the President and the Vice President talk all the time about the heroes, but when I’ve been out there I’ve seen the doctors, I’ve seen the nurses and all those that have worked very, very hard, and we’re just so proud to be part of this noble calling.
General Semonite: (10:09)
For my team, I really made it very, very simple. I said, “There’s three legs of this stool and they all have S’s.” There’s sites, in other words hospitals. We’ve got to worry about supplies, and we’ve got to worry about staff. And so right when Governor Cuomo called the President about almost 30 days ago and said, “I need some help,” worrying about what could be tens of thousands of hospital room shortages.
General Semonite: (10:32)
So the President and Secretary of Defense asked us to fly to Albany with a team. And on the way up we understood how complex of a challenge this was, and we knew there’s no way you can solve a complex catastrophe with a complicated solution. We needed a very, very simple solution to be able to then work with HHS, to be able to work with FEMA, to be able to work with the Vice President’s task force, and then to be able to power this down all the way down to the local level. Some of the governors asked us to try to build a hospital in a parking lot or a field in two or three weeks. You can’t physically do that. So what we said was let’s go to where there’s an existing facility, and I’m going to kind of make this in two big pots. Those that are either hotel rooms or college dormitories, smaller rooms, or those that are in real large areas like field houses or convention centers.
General Semonite: (11:21)
And we designed those standard facilities that could be either non-COVID or COVID, and then we got that approved here at the federal government to be able to then power that back down. So we went to Governor Cuomo and he said right up front, “I love the concept. I need you in the Javits Center. I’m ready to start having you work tomorrow afternoon.” So when we flew back that afternoon, the next day we basically built the standard design and then continued to be able to power it down all the way down through the rest of the team.
General Semonite: (11:48)
So I just want to show you a couple of slides here, and we’ll let know where we’re at right now, Mr. President. We had to do a bunch of assessments. So somewhere in the order of over 1100 different locations we went to, and we worked for FEMA, we worked for the President, and we worked for governors and mayors. And we said, “What do you think your demand is going to be?” And based on a lot of the modeling that’s been in this room here, we were able to understand when the peak curve was, but we also were able to understand where’s the bed shortage. So then these 1100 facilities right now today, so we’re actually executing 32 different facilities. That’s on the order of merit of about 16,000 beds. Eight of those are all done. We’ve still got a lot more to complete, and in the next week-and-a-half we’re going to complete about 15 more facilities. We’ve got some pending. Some mayors and governors are still wondering do they have enough bed space.
General Semonite: (12:43)
And what’s important here is we need a very agile plan. You can’t do something three weeks ago and think that this is going to continue to stay because this virus gets a vote. And this entire team, the federal government’s tried to be as agile as they can supporting those states and those governors. The beauty of the plan though is it doesn’t have to be built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. So we designed about an extra 52 facilities. We gave those to the governors and I’ve got to be very, very laudatory to the governors, they then imposed and put a lot of those on the ground and did those themselves.
General Semonite: (13:16)
So let’s go. I’m just going to show you some real simple pictures here. Go to the next slide if you don’t mind. So this is an example of the Javits Center, and you’ve heard the President talk about it quite a few times. This one about 2100 bed spaces. What you get is about a 11 or 12 foot square cubicle. There is lights in there, there’s a nurse call so if you need to be able to call the nurse station. There are nurse stations throughout. There’s pharmacies throughout. This one started as non-COVID but then we came back in and put in central oxygen so everybody has oxygen right behind their bed to be able to take care of those patients, and again, built this one about a thousand patients treated.
General Semonite: (13:56)
Let’s go to the next one. I was up in Detroit with Governor Whitmere and she walked us through and told us her intent. Here’s what she needed to do this in the TCF Center. You’ll see all the cubicles that are laid out. This is right in the middle of a convention floor where there might be like a boat show or a car show, and then went in and built 970 different capabilities there. And again, a lot of great work by my guys in the Corps of Engineers and the rest of the mayor’s and the city’s team all pulling together.
General Semonite: (14:23)
Let’s go to the next one. This is called the McCormick Place. Governor Pritzker sat us down. He said, “Here’s our intent or what you want to do.” Mayor Lightfoot walked us through and we went into another large convention center. This is actually 3000 bed spaces, a very, very large build, and got this one done in a relatively short time.
General Semonite: (14:41)
And then here’s another one that kind of helps you understand the dynamic here. Go to the next one please. This is in Miami Beach. And I flew in to see Governor DeSantis, and my guys had scoped out about 450 beds and he said, “Todd, how long is it going to take to build this?” And we said probably until the 27th of April. And he went to his health people and he said, “How long do you need?” And he said, “The day we need this is the 21st of April.” And I told my guys, “You don’t have until the 27th. Figure out how to get it done by the 20th.” This is where you don’t get to build to be able to have the perfect solution. You’ve got to be able to get the mission essential done. Lives are on the line here and we’ve got to be able to get everything done to be able to save those lives.
General Semonite: (15:22)
And let’s go to the last one here. This is one we’re doing right now, Colorado. This is in Denver and another gigantic convention center. You’ll see all the different cubicles here to be able to just bring in that oxygen, six-inch copper pipe that comes in and it’s all piped throughout the entire convention center, six miles of pipe that’s able to go in to be able to make that happen.
General Semonite: (15:42)
And in closing, I just want to be able to say that we are very, very focused in the Corps of Engineers getting this done. But this is all about the team, the federal team, the state team, the local team, the vice president’s task force, and a lot of the people sitting here, have informed us of how fast we need to go. And it goes back to again, all the governors and the mayors to make this happen.
General Semonite: (16:02)
But I want to reiterate, President Trump has called me three times, and Secretary Esper has been on the phone at least one of those times, and said, “What else do we need to do to set you up for success? Is there any other knobs we can turn to be able to help you build?” And you think about that equation of those three S’s. I think that with the federal government and the mayors in the cities here, we’ve effectively taken that first S out of the equation. And so I can’t tell you of all the things I’ve done in my career, this is a noble calling to be able to step up and save American lives. So with that, sir, I thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (16:31)
Fantastic, Jeff. Thank you very much. Anybody have a question for the General while he’s here? Anybody? Because I think it’s very self-explanatory. He’s done an incredible job. Jeff, do you have a question?
Speaker 3: (16:42)
I do. Are there more projects, sir, beyond the ones that you’ve just identified that you’ll be working on?
General Semonite: (16:46)
So about a week ago we thought we were about capped at 26. What we’re seeing is, as I said, the virus gets a vote. We’re seeing some of these curves are stretching out where we might’ve thought we only had five or six days. We actually have a couple of weeks now. Other ones we’re seeing exactly the opposite. So where we didn’t think there was some, and I’m not going to go into locations here, but we are definitely get requested and we’ve got six more requesting just in the last four or five days. They’re a little bit smaller facilities in more remote areas, but our job, we still, if we have enough time to go build, we want to get in there, do the assessment. We work for the mayor, and the city, and the governor here, and we can still get them done if the mayors and those elected officials make a fast enough decision.
Donald Trump: (17:24)
You might say while you’re here, you’re building… The General’s in charge of the wall on the Southern border, and we want to build 450 miles of wall and it’s very much under construction. You might give them a little bit of an update. How are we doing with the wall?
General Semonite: (17:37)
So, sir, I think the most important thing, and you stressed this and Secretary Esper stressed this, there’s really several different priorities here. Our number one priority in Department of Defense and the Corps of Engineers is to protect the team, protect the force. No matter what we do, we’ve got to continue to take care of our civilians and our service members out there, and so every single thing we’re doing, whether we’re building for the VA, or we’re building for civil works projects, or for the Department of Defense, or building on the Southwest border, we are going out of our way.
General Semonite: (18:03)
I talked to my commanders this morning, we’ve got over 4,000 contractors that are on the ground out there and we’ve had no positives as of this morning, knock on wood. Same thing with my 400 employees. We’re testing them. Not necessarily one of the more stringent tests, but with temperatures, to be able to make sure that everybody’s safe and everybody goes out of their way to do things the right way. Construction is going very, very smooth. What we’re seeing is our contractors are extremely focused. Now that we’ve got a good clear path both on the CBP program as well as some of the DOD program. We, I think, very well postured it’s a very, very aggressive build, but we’re well postured to be able to meet your expectations, sir, of 450 by the end of December 2020.
Donald Trump: (18:44)
And we’re over 160 miles.
General Semonite: (18:47)
164 as of today, sir.
Donald Trump: (18:48)
164 miles. And we’ll have it done sometime pretty early next year. Very exciting.
General Semonite: (18:55)
Yes, sir.
Donald Trump: (18:56)
And you might just say one thing, the quality of that wall in terms of its power for stopping people that shouldn’t be coming into our country.
General Semonite: (19:03)
So, same thing, if you have a standard design that you trust in and it works very well. I’ve got to pat on the back Commissioner Morgan. He was very adamant to continue to be able to make sure that it supports his agents. And so we’ve got a design now that certainly does that. And then we’ve got a phenomenal contractor workforce that’s in there, my Corp of Engineer employees and it’s going in well. We don’t see any significant problems. And I think it’s also important to point out that we want to do this the right way. So we try to balance this with environmental considerations that are out there. We’re trying to do due diligence when it comes to anything to do with any of the citizens that are affected. We’re trying to make sure that we’re protecting all of the things that we need to protect and try to find that balance where we can both meet the administration’s directive while at the same time making sure we’re doing this so that everybody gets a vote and everybody has a fair shake.
Donald Trump: (19:56)
Yeah, please.
Speaker 4: (19:57)
My I ask what you’re doing regarding the availability at the recreation sites that the Army Corps of Engineers operates? How the access is going there and whether or not there were restrictions?
General Semonite: (20:10)
So I’m an engineer. I take my guidance from some of these experts sitting on the bench over here, and when the President says, “Turn on America,” what we initially did, like many, many other governors, they shut down beaches, shut down cities. I had a meeting with my commanders this morning, and as soon as we think it’s safe, turn them back on. I mean parking out there at a rec area where you’re 500 feet away from everybody in a camper is probably low threat. I will continue to take guidance from the administration, but where we get green lights to continue to put our rec areas full up and let everybody go back out there and do things in the safest way. I mean, we work for the administration so I want to do it safe, but I don’t want to be the last guy that turns things on. Not at all. Yes ma’am.
Speaker 5: (20:51)
Thanks for walking us through some of the efforts. Can you say anything about whether or not there are any specific efforts in communities that are hardest hit like black communities or Latino communities, communities of color? Are the Army Corps of Engineers doing anything that would be building any sort of temporary facilities for those communities?
General Semonite: (21:06)
So, we basically key off what the city asked for, the city and the governor. There are a couple of specific areas that certain city mayors have asked us for. Again, I’m not going to go into details, but we basically, if they go in and say, “I’m very worried about a hotspot on this side of town or a specific community here,” we will do, and that’s what the administration is charged to do, is whatever we can do to be most responsive. We just don’t want ever to have an ambulance pull up to the back of a hospital and somebody says, “We’re out of room, go to the next hospital down.” So that’s where we’re trying to make sure that that bed space is available, and so far everything we built has been ahead of need. In other words, we’re able to finish the building two or three days before it’s needed. Thank you ma’am.
Donald Trump: (21:46)
Okay. So you don’t really have a choice. You can stay and watch these wonderful people ask us really nice questions or you can go back to building beds.
General Semonite: (21:54)
Sir, I get a lot of building to do. I’m going to leave, if you don’t mind.
Donald Trump: (21:56)
Go ahead [inaudible 00:00:21:56].
General Semonite: (21:57)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (21:58)
Very impressive. That’s an impressive job. Isn’t it? Seriously. That’s really great. Thank you very much. He’s a terrific gentleman. We have a lot of great people doing that kind of thing that they really have to get recognition for the incredible job they are doing because I don’t think anybody else could do it. Nothing like that. And that’s on top of thousands and thousands of hospitals, and he built just in New York alone, four hospitals and 2, 900 beds, and got them done so quickly. Nobody saw anything like it. Fortunately, we haven’t had to use too many of them and that’s okay. That’s probably better news than having to use them all. Right? Because a lot of good things are happening in New York and elsewhere.
Donald Trump: (22:47)
So through the public, private partnerships, and deregulation, the federal government has already made immense testing capabilities available, but some states need to take action to fully utilize it. To date, the United States has conducted millions more tests than any other country. You can add them all up and they don’t catch us. And our numbers are doubling almost on, certainly on a monthly basis, but almost on a weekly basis. We’re moving very rapidly, at a number nobody thought possible. And we’ll be doubling our number of daily tests if the governors bring their states fully online through the capability that they have. We have tremendous capability out there already existing and we explained that to the governor today. Mike and all of the people explained it very strongly to the governors. They really get it now I think.
Donald Trump: (23:40)
As the experts have explained, this capacity is sufficient to allow states to conduct diagnostic testing to treat patients, as well as contact tracing to contain outbreaks and monitoring to pinpoint potential hotspots during phase one. And there are some hotspots and we have them pinpointed, and they can really cover it very, very nicely when they know exactly where to go, and they’re being told where to go. And also these locations where they’re going, and some of them are federal, some of the governors didn’t realize they were allowed to use federal locations. They are. And we have a booklet of the federal locations. We can hold it up. I think you’ll show that. Maybe we’ll hold it up now. Yeah. Okay, fine. But you see the number of things. These are all locations where they can go, which is really pretty amazing. This is just one page out of many. Look at this. These are all locations. That’s a lot of locations. And they can all… What is it, 5,000?
Speaker 6: (24:50)
5,000 [inaudible 00:24:51].
Donald Trump: (24:52)
Thank you very much. That’s more than anybody thought, and it’s already there. They have to use it. That’s all, they have to use it. Some weren’t aware. Some were very much aware, some weren’t aware.
Donald Trump: (25:03)
My administration also continues to support states with our massive operation to deliver masks, gowns, gloves and other vital supplies. Admiral Policheck and his team at FIFA are really… What a job they’ve done. And Pete, what a job he’s done. They’re calling on Easter Sunday to make sure everyone’s okay. But they are using detailed data about supply chains to track the deployment of 1 billion pieces of protective equipment through private distributors every two weeks. So what we’re doing is we’re delivering a number that nobody anywhere in the world is delivering. FEMA is working closely with Dr. Berkson, the distributors, to prioritize supply of resources where they are most needed, where finding the [inaudible 00:25:52] that they have to. They have to get to that location. We have locations that are very important to get to, and get to them fast, and that’s where they’re going. So we have a very strong priority.
Donald Trump: (26:03)
… and that’s where they’re going, so we have a very strong priority. This pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of keeping vital supply chains at home. We cannot outsource our independence. We cannot be reliant on foreign nations. I’ve been saying this for a long time. If we’ve learned one thing, it’s let’s do it here. Let’s build it here. Let’s make it here. We’ve got the greatest country in the world. We got to start bringing our supply chains back.
Donald Trump: (26:25)
Somebody years ago got this crazy idea, let’s build all over the place and let’s have parts. Let’s have a screw for a car delivered and made in a country that’s far away and let’s have a fender made someplace else and let’s do this and let’s do that and let’s put it all together. I like making it right here in the USA. I think we’ve learned a lot about that and especially maybe when it comes to pharmaceutical products.
Donald Trump: (26:52)
We’ve also conducted major military operations providing cities and states with additional medical capacity and the incredible 1,800 men and women from the Army Corps of Engineers. You just met with Todd. The job they’ve done is incredible, but we have nurses, doctors, we have experts in every field, all over.
Donald Trump: (27:16)
Spoke with governor Cuomo, spoke with Mayor de Blasio, spoke with many of the other governors that I’m both friendly, and I think I’m friendly with just about all of them if you can believe it, but I’ve gotten friendly with a lot of them. I’ve gained a lot of respect for a lot of the governors, both Republican and Democrat during this process. Some really good people, some really good talent, but we’re sending a lot of our medical people, not only our construction people like Todd Semonite, but a lot of our medical people are being sent all over the country to different locations, New York City, New York State and New Jersey. I spoke with Phil today, he’s doing a terrific job in New Jersey, but New Jersey got hit very, very hard. Phil Murphy, governor.
Donald Trump: (28:02)
From the day this crisis began, America launched a scientific mobilization of colossal size and scale. Someday they’ll be able to write the true story because nobody’s seen anything like it. The fake news just refuses to cover it correctly, but that’s okay. The people are understanding and that’s what matters to me.
Donald Trump: (28:24)
There are now 72 active trials underway across the United States researching dozens of therapies and treatments and another 211 are in the planning stages. They’re getting, I mean, they’re literally mobilizing on therapeutics and also on vaccines. A tremendous progress is being made on vaccines and I must say on therapeutics. I mean, frankly, if I had my choice, give me the therapeutics right now because that would help people right now. We have some things that I think are working. Not only working, but we have some incredible things that look like they could be an answer, but we’ll know soon, being tested, working out right now.
Donald Trump: (29:07)
This includes therapies designed to attack the virus as well as others that would hinder its replication, reduce the rate of infection, control the immune response or transfer lifesaving antibodies from the blood of recovered patients. One of the incredible things that we’ve seen, and Mike and I were talking about it before, is the fact oftentimes somebody gets very ill from the plague, okay, from this horrible scourge and they get better and they recover. The first thing they say is, “I want to give my blood.” That’s happened. The doctors have told me it’s happened so much. “I want to give my blood, I want to give my blood,” and they’re doing that.
Donald Trump: (29:49)
But tremendous things are happening. You’ll be seeing that over the weeks. I think we’ll be talking about it in the not too distant future. Johnson & Johnson’s very well along on vaccines. Again, the vaccines have to be tested. The therapeutics are for now, but a lot of good things are happening on both. But ultimately we also hope to prevent infection through a safe, a very safe vaccine. That’ll be a great thing when we have that and we will have that.
Donald Trump: (30:15)
With that, I’d like to introduce Admiral Giroir and Brad Smith to discuss some of the incredible things that have been done and we have, they really are. What they’ve been able to do at a very, very short period of time. Equipment, you’re going to see equipment that you haven’t seen before and if you’d just come up Brad, if you guys would come up, you could give us a little display of some of the equipment that we have and some of the things that are happening having to do with testing because testing is a big word.
Donald Trump: (30:47)
Remember, it was all ventilators and the reason it was all ventilators they said, “There’s no way he’ll ever be able to catch this one,” and not only did we catch it, we are now the King of Ventilators all over the world. We can send them anywhere. We have thousands being made a week and they’re very high quality and that’s wasn’t playing well.
Donald Trump: (31:08)
Then they said testing, testing, “Oh, we’ll get him on testing.” Well, testing is much easier than ventilator. Ventilators are big machines that are very complex, that are very expensive. You need a group of people that really know what they’re doing. We took auto lines, we took a lot of different people and now we’ve done that. But it used to be ventilators, ventilators, ventilators. Now it’s testing, testing, testing.
Donald Trump: (31:33)
I think the Admiral and I think that Brad will show you some things that you haven’t seen that are really a very spectacular having to do with testing. We’re way advanced, way advanced. The list I showed you, these are places you can go if you’re in the states, 5,000 different machines. 5,000, they’re all over the country and we have international also. But these are all over the country. But you’ll see something now that’s really eye-popping in terms of what they’ve done and they’ve done this under great pressure. They’ve come up with things under great pressure that are absolutely amazing.
Donald Trump: (32:13)
Please, if you would. Thank you, folks.
Admiral Giroir: (32:19)
Well, thank you, Mr. President. Want to talk about a couple things today a little bit different than I’ve spoken about before. Since early March, we’ve really been focusing on two key concepts for testing. Number one, to assure and expand supplies in the U.S. market. This is really critical because we were talking about really a cottage industry with very minimal suppliers that we were asking to supply over a two-week period of time the normal production that would be for at least a year. As simple as a swab is, a swab is not a swab is not a swab, and we need to be very careful that when we put something in a person and tell them a test result that it’s really correct.
Admiral Giroir: (33:01)
The second component is to secure sufficient supplies at FEMA during this time of peak disease where we could alleviate any maldistributions within the state. This is the theme of process of requesting and sending things out and also supporting outbreaks.
Admiral Giroir: (33:16)
So, starting many weeks ago, starting in my office many weeks ago, we assembled a multidisciplinary team of really incredible people. The medical side of the equation, which I represent, the laboratory side of the equation, high-tech side of the equation, logistics and operation and Brad Smith, his day job is Director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an incredibly important component of our country’s CMS system, building the future healthcare system, but has done a really incredible job operationally and logistically in bringing everyone together.
Admiral Giroir: (33:52)
We have focused on every piece of the supply chain that relates to testing down to the most minute detail and he’s going to talk to you about some of that, but that started in the second week of March with starting an air lift because the only supplier, the main supplier of swabs at that time was a place in Italy that was completely shut off because of the outbreak in Italy. So, Admiral Polowczyk arranged gray tail Air Force planes to go to Italy to bring millions of swabs back to secure. That’s just how it started and it’s expanded since then.
Admiral Giroir: (34:22)
The second part is we’ve been really marrying, and this has been the beauty, the logistics and supplies to the overall strategy, two pieces of strategy. Number one, what is the overall testing strategy? Dr. Birx has had just an elegant strategy in the past, but even more important in the future when we make sure we take care of indigent populations and those most vulnerable. So the clinical, the contact tracing and the monitoring of those who are at most risk.
Admiral Giroir: (34:51)
We’ve also married it to the strategy and you’ve heard more than you wanted to know about it, that a small machine that’s point-of-care is good for certain things, but it’s not going to test 5,000 people over a short period of time. So, the small machines, the medium machines and the large machines and how to contextualize them.
Admiral Giroir: (35:08)
The third thing, before I give it to Brad, which is very important and it’s really critical, is coordinating the research, the epidemiology and the FDA regulatory process. Why is that so important? When we started five weeks ago, if we wanted to test this many people with the technology we had, we would have used about 80% of the strategic national stockpile in PPE just to do testing.
Admiral Giroir: (35:32)
We needed an innovation. That innovation was to be able to test out of the anterior nose with a completely different kind of swab. It sounds very mundane, but if you don’t do that, you can’t get the testing to scale. That allowed us to really go to widespread testing.
Admiral Giroir: (35:46)
Last week, moving to polyester swabs, which is going to open up millions of new swabs onto the market, but that’s a regulatory science and innovation step that had to co-occur with this and with that, I’m going to let Brad talk about some of the details that he has really shepherded over the past weeks in ways that have truly been amazing and incredibly impressive to me.
Brad Smith: (36:09)
Well, thank you, Mr. President. It’s an honor of a lifetime to be here and serving in this way. I’ve been working under Dr. Birx’s and Admiral Giroir’s leadership over the past several weeks to help increase the supply of testing across the United States.
Brad Smith: (36:22)
As you all know, there’s really three parts that you need to make the test work. First, you need the machine, which has Dr. Birx will share more and the president spoke to. We have a very, very large number of those across the United States. It’s about making sure that we’re taking advantage of them. The second part of the testing is making sure that we have the collection supplies to actually be able to collect the specimen and I’ll talk a little bit more about that. Then the third part is making sure that you have the materials you need to support the machine to ensure that you can actually process the test once it gets to the lab.
Brad Smith: (36:54)
I’ll let Dr. Birx talk more about the machines here in a second, but as you’ll see across the United States, we have a tremendous number. They range in variety, so we have some very small machines that do point-of-care testing. They may do, say, 50 to a 100 tests a day. We also have other very large machines. They can do several thousand, process several thousand tests a day.
Brad Smith: (37:15)
On the collection supply piece, I’ll talk through a couple of different kinds of collection that that can be done. For the nucleic acid test, which are the tests that are currently being done today, you generally need a swab of the nose. To do that, you need the swab, you need the collection tube and you also need the transport media that it can be transported in. We have a large, very large number of swabs already in the country, but we have secured an additional 30 million in production that we’ll be ramping up over the next several weeks.
Brad Smith: (37:46)
One company, located in the Northeast, we’re going to be using Title III of the DPA to help them build four new production lines. They are currently the largest swab producer in the country and this will help them ramp up their production tremendously to over 20 million additional swabs a month. A second company located in Ohio is currently the largest Q-tip maker in the country. We’re helping them convert their line from making Q-tips into making swabs. They are actually ramping up production starting this week of swabs and we’ll be ramping up to over 10 million per month. In total, that’s over 30 million new swabs that will be coming just over the next handful of weeks.
Brad Smith: (38:25)
The second piece is on the collection tubes. The collection tubes, we’ve been partnering with Oak Ridge National Lab, a Department of Energy lab based in Tennessee. They have very unique and sophisticated injection molding manufacturing capability and they are in the process of ramping that up to create collection tubes and they will be ramping up to over 40 million collection tubes a month here over the next several weeks.
Brad Smith: (38:50)
In addition to the swabs, we believe that as testing progresses there’ll be other types of testing like serological testing that will occur and those samples have to be collected in different ways. Many times some of those tests will require a finger prick. So in addition, we secured over 17 million lancets, which is what you use for the finger prick, so that we have those available as well as 17 million alcohol swabs, which is what you need to clean the finger before you do the finger prick.
Brad Smith: (39:17)
In addition, although folks are not talking about this much yet, we also believe that businesses across the country may want thermometers to test folks as they come into the office, and so we’ve secured over 650,000 infrared thermometers that states and businesses will be able to access to be able to test folks as they come into work. I think we’ve made tremendous progress on the collection side.
Brad Smith: (39:39)
In addition to the collection side, we’ve been very focused on ensuring that the labs have what they need. To process a specimen in a lab, you really need two things. You need something called an extraction kit and you needs something called a PCR test. In order to be able to fully process a test, you need both of these things. Sometimes these things come together and sometimes they come separate. For some of our point-of-care tests, including the Abbott and [Sefia 00:40:05] tests, they come together. They are ramping up production rapidly to over 3 million of those tests per month and these are tests that did not exist even a month ago.
Brad Smith: (40:15)
The second piece is on some of these large machines. They also sell complex cartridges that come together. One of the big manufacturers that has already ramped up production from about 1.6 million a month to more than twice that already and that’s already occurred. In addition to when they come together, they also sometimes come separate and we see significant ramping up of production there from our manufacturers through our public private partnerships. We’re seeing both several million more over the next few weeks of both the RNA extraction kit as well as the PCR test kit. So with that, thank you.
Donald Trump: (40:49)
Mike, please. Thank you, Brian.
Mike Pence: (40:53)
Thank you, Mr. President and I share your admiration for this remarkable team from the Army Corps of Engineers, to Brad, to Admiral Giroir. They’re doing a remarkable job every day.
Mike Pence: (41:07)
As the President mentioned today, we had our weekly conference call with governors across the country, states and territories and I was able to convey to them our appreciation for the leadership that every governor of every state and territory has provided. Thanks to their leadership, thanks to the extraordinary cooperation of the American people, despite the fact that more than 770,000 Americans have contracted the coronavirus and our hearts grieve for the more than 41,000 Americans who’ve lost their life, the truth is that as we stand here today, we are slowing the spread and as the president reflected, we continue to see steady progress in less cases, lower hospitalizations, even in hotspots around the country. We commended America’s governors for their efforts in that regard. We are preserving our health care capacity as the general with the Army Corps of Engineers reflected. With the President’s direction, we’ve built a great number of hospitals around the country, but the utilization rate has been fairly low because of the mitigation efforts, the cooperation of the American people, we have not had to use them. That, as the president said, is very good news.
Mike Pence: (42:25)
In a word, we thank governors across the country for taking actions, decisive action to save lives and to make a difference. I reminded them that we’re all in this together and we have one mission, we’re one team. We spoke on the conference call about last week’s guidelines to open up America again and we heard from governors across the country about the progress that they’re making. We spoke to governors from New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Michigan about their ongoing efforts at social distancing and address questions that they had about needs that had been spoken up already in this presentation today.
Mike Pence: (43:05)
In addition, as we promised last week when we spoke to governors on Thursday about the guidelines to open up America, our team presented every governor in the country, states and territories, with a memorandum detailing laboratory capacity in all locations of laboratory equipment for diagnostic tests that can perform the coronavirus test. We also provided, as Dr. Birx will elaborate in just a few moments, literally a map about where these testing devices are located.
Mike Pence: (43:41)
I must tell you, Mr. President, I was very impressed at the way governors, as we speak, are scaling testing in their own states using these resources. Our hope is that by providing this information and by our team that we’ve enlisted out of Walter Reed, it’s contacting every one of the laboratories in the country to find out what their needs are and to encourage them to activate those testing machines to do coronavirus testing that will continue to be able to support a state-managed effort to increase testing even more.
Mike Pence: (44:12)
But a few highlights. Governor Doug Ducey announced antibody testing for 250,000 health professionals this week and first responders, a partnership between the state and the University of Arizona. We spoke today about Governor Gavin Newsom’s announcement that he set up a task force for testing, five to seven high-capacity testing hubs in partnership with the UC San Diego and UC Davis to increase testing in high capacity labs around the state of California.
Mike Pence: (44:43)
We heard from governor Ron DeSantis, Mr. President, about the efforts of the state of Florida. I believe he said that at this time Florida had conducted 275,000 coronavirus tests and they’re in the process of a major expansion of statewide testing with the goal of opening up additional sites and using the Florida National Guard to test residents at nursing homes and long-term care facilities in Florida.
Mike Pence: (45:09)
We also recommended today to every governor’s attention, the public health website that the State of Florida established, which has useful information on a county-by-county level about where testing is happening. Mr. President, as you said, governors are utilizing testing assets. They’re managing and deploying these resources as they see fit. At your direction, we’re going to continue to work very closely with them.
Mike Pence: (45:33)
Other governors that we spoke with included governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. There are 13 new or expanded coronavirus drive-through testing sites in Michigan that her team has stood up with Michigan Primary Care Association and we assured her that we would continue to work, as Brad and Admiral Giroir are literally working around the clock, to make sure that they have the supplies to support all of that testing. As the President said, Governor Hogan, who always begins our conference calls as he’s Chairman of the National Governors Association, expressed appreciation for last week’s guidelines to open America up again and his appreciation on behalf of all the governors for the list of laboratories in each individual state. He did raise the issue that we had included on the list Department of Defense facilities that have laboratories and machines and also other federal facilities, many of which are in Maryland. I was able to assure Governor Hogan, and every governor on the call, that we will make all of those laboratories available across the country to every state as the need for testing capacity continues to scale.
Mike Pence: (46:47)
This is one more step where you see the Army Corps of Engineer, where you literally see thousands of military doctors and nurses on the streets in New York and other cities around the country, this is one more step where we’re literally, as the President said from early on, are leaving no stone unturned and we are delivering a whole-of-government approach for our States as they, as they deal with the coronavirus outbreak.
Mike Pence: (47:12)
Governors are continuing to expand testing and we assured them that we’re going to continue to work in every way to support their efforts to do just that. I will say again as we’ve said before, as Dr. Birx comes up to explain to you what we deliver to the governors today, we told the governors once again today that by our best estimates we have enough testing capacity today for every state in America to go to Phase I, if they meet the other criteria of 14 days of reduced cases and sufficient hospital capacity to prepare for any eventuality that may occur.
Mike Pence: (47:52)
Once again, we have enough testing capacity for every state in America to go to Phase I, but we assured the governors today that we’re going to continue to work around the clock to expand the testing capacity, support supplies and to support their efforts to encourage social distancing and the very mitigation efforts that the American people have been doing that have brought us the progress that we see all across the country today.
Mike Pence: (48:17)
With that Mr. President, I’ll just let Dr. Burks describe what we distributed today.
Donald Trump: (48:23)
Thank you, Mike. Debra.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (48:24)
Thank you, Mr. Vice president, Mr. President. We just want to show you a couple of additional slides but also to remind all of Americans that we still have a significant number of cases, both in the Boston area and across Massachusetts and Chicago, to really that our hearts go out to those cities as they continue to struggle with coronavirus and the consequences at the hospitalization, to all the healthcare providers that are on the front lines.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (48:50)
These are just an illustration of the different types of equipment that are out there. Describing them both as low-speed, but quick turnaround time, to high-speed and taking three to four hours to actually run 100 or more tests. The equipment ranged from all those different … That’s why there’s 5,000 of them as noted by the President in this list.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (49:13)
We wanted every governor and every state and health laboratory director to have a clear understanding of the full capacity within the state, both for the capacity but also where technical assistance and additional supplies may be available. We were proud to put the federal labs on that list because the military and the VA have stepped up every step of the way to provide support, both in testing and care. We have many military members on the front lines and I’m sure the military would offer their facilities to the Governor of Maryland or any governor who wanted to utilize those to expand testing.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (49:51)
The next slide, I’m just going to run through them very quickly. Every governor not only received the Excel spreadsheet with the complete list of the equipment and the zip code of the location and the laboratory to really be able to create a mosaic of laboratories of the high-speed and low-speed equipment together to meet the needs of their clients depending if their drive-through or hospital needs.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (50:17)
This is what Florida looks like, next slide. This is what Louisiana looks like, next slide. Maryland with significant capacity, next slide. Virginia with significant capacity throughout the state, next slide. New York, obviously a lot of capacity in New York City with overlapping capacity. It’s important to know where this is because then hospitals and labs can support each other when they need surge capacity, next slide. This is New Jersey, next slide. Pennsylvania, next slide. Massachusetts, next slide. Ohio, next slide. Oklahoma, next slide. Washington, next slide. I think that’s Wyoming. We wanted to show both in states that have large populations and in States that have lower populations, you can see that in general, the number of machines match their population, and we’re working with the Walter Reed group and the American Society of Microbiologists and all the lab directors to really create a web of understanding of what the capacity is currently, what the capacity can be, and how the federal government can support them in developing their strategies linked to the overarching federal strategy of testing as outlined in our guidelines.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (51:36)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Reporter: (51:38)
Question for Dr. Birx [crosstalk 00:51:39].
Donald Trump: (51:39)
Yeah.
Reporter: (51:39)
Dr. Birx, University of Southern California and the L.A. County Public Health put out a report today that suggests that the penetrance of the virus is as much as almost 40 times as what it was believed to be. That as many as 442,000 people in L.A. County may have been affected, which suggests two things. It suggests that you have a lot more people out there who could be spreading the virus, but it also suggests that the case-
Speaker 7: (52:03)
… out there who could be spreading the virus. But it also suggests, that the case fatality rate is more in line with the 2017/2018 flu than what we’ve seen in some other areas of the world. But I’m wondering if you’ve seen that, what your thoughts were.
Dr. Birx: (52:13)
So we’re looking at all those studies very carefully. And I think you will remember over the last three weeks I’ve been talking about the level of asymptomatic spread and my concern about asymptomatic spread. Because, with flu and other diseases when people are sick, it’s easy to contact trace. When people are not sick and shedding virus, you have to have a very different approach, a very different sentinel surveillance approach, a sentinel monitoring approach, which we outlined in the guidelines. And it’s why the guidelines took that very seriously. We knew that was unique for respiratory diseases, but it was because we were very concerned about the level of asymptomatic. And if you remember, we used to… We talked about younger age groups may have more asymptomatic disease and your asymptomatic disease may decrease with your older age groups, and that your symptomatic disease might increase with age groups. This is still our working hypothesis, we have no data right now still to support that.
Dr. Birx: (53:13)
But it’s these kinds of studies that help that. We know that New York and Detroit and other cities are very interested, which we want to also support them, in testing frontline responders, first responders and healthcare workers, because we think their exposure may have been the greatest. What we don’t want to do… And I’m just going to do another 30 seconds on testing. These tests are not 100% sensitive or specific. And I’m going to go over this over and over again. So if you have 1% of your population infected and you have a test that’s only 99% specific, that means that when you find a positive, 50% of the time will be a real positive and 50% of the time it won’t be.
Dr. Birx: (53:59)
And that’s why we’re really asking people to start testing in among the first responders and the healthcare workers that may have had the greatest exposure, because that’s where the test will be most reliable. And then, when we have the luxury, we can go out to broader and broader communities. But this has been the fundamental question to begin with, and has been persistent. And we will emphasize to the American people again, this is a highly contagious virus. And we don’t know by looking at someone whether they have preexisting conditions or not. And so, all of us as far as protecting others must continue to do all of the recommendations to ensure that when we are in an asymptomatic state, we’re not passing the virus to others.
Speaker 8: (54:43)
I have a question for you as well, the governor of South Carolina announced today, they’re going to open some stores with restrictions, but they just told my colleague [Natasha Chin 00:02:50] that they have not achieved that criteria in The White House guidelines about the downward trajectory for 14 days. So, shouldn’t they not be reopening stores today?
Dr. Birx: (55:00)
We have asked every governor to follow the guidelines just as we’ve asked every American to follow the guidelines put out by the president. But, each of the governors can decide for themselves whether they’ve reached specific guidelines in specific areas. I had a question, I think on Saturday, about Jacksonville and their beaches. So, I did spend about five hours going to every state website, and I will tell you, that the Florida’s Department of Health Website is extraordinary, and this is what every department of health should have. Because when you go to that website, you can see that most of the cases are in Southern Florida, in the Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Broward County area. And if you look in Jacksonville, they had less than 20 cases per day, and less than 800 in four weeks. And so, these are the kinds of… When you inform the public and give them the information that they need, then they can make decisions along with the local government and governors. So, I’m not going to say specifically with South Carolina because I don’t know their specific website right now and I don’t talk about data unless I’ve seen it myself, but I know from Jacksonville that they had less than 20 cases a day. And so, this is how we need to start informing the community. These websites are critical. It’s by zip code and it’s by county, they can see cases, they can see cumulative cases, they can see new cases, they can see hospitalizations, they can see mortality, they can see age groups of mortality, and they can see where every testing piece is. This is how we have to inform the American public, and this is where the American public will develop confidence in each of their counties and local governments
Speaker 9: (56:38)
[inaudible 00:56:38] the vice president mentioned that there’s enough testing capacity right now to proceed to phase one. But what about phase two or phase three, is there… Are there enough machines or enough cartridges? Are there enough reagents right now for the sort of reopening of the administration’s envisioning taking place over the next month or two?
Dr. Birx: (56:53)
So you can see the current machine outline and you can see that both of these gentlemen have prepared to have everything ready for phase two and preparing it now for what we will need in the future. And I think that’s what you saw with the ventilators, that’s what you’re seeing with PPE. It’s not just for today, it’s for tomorrow. And it’s our federal planning, is not just for this instant. It’s making sure that we meet the needs of this instance, but we’re planning for 30 and 60 and 90 days ahead.
Donald Trump: (57:24)
Admiral, go ahead [inaudible 00:57:23].
Admiral Giroir: (57:25)
I would just agree with Dr. Birx completely. We are ready right now to enter phase one and we are ramping up all our capabilities across the board, not just to achieve what’s necessary for phase two but 2X, 3X, 4X, so that we will be absolutely over prepared when the nation is ready to go into those phases.
Speaker 10: (57:48)
President Trump.
Donald Trump: (57:48)
And by the way, not everybody agrees that we have to do that much testing. We’re going maximum, you understand? There’s some people who don’t want to do that much testing, but we’re going maximum, we’re going to the outer limits. And I think that’s the way probably it should be. Jeff, go ahead.
Jeff: (58:01)
Mr. President, to return to a topic that you opened the press conference with, on oil. US crude futures today went below zero, went into negative territory.
Donald Trump: (58:11)
Went negative.
Jeff: (58:11)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (58:12)
Like interest rates, they go negative.
Jeff: (58:14)
Does that make you want to see Saudi Arabia and Russia and OPEC-plus do more to reduce supply?
Donald Trump: (58:20)
Well, it’s for short-term. Much of it has do with short sellers. Much of it has to do… If you look a month into the future, I think it’s at 25 or $28 a barrel, so a lot of people got caught. They got caught and there are a lot of people that are not too happy because they got caught. So, if you take a look at it, you’ll see it’s more of a financial thing than an oil situation. But… Because you take… I believe in a month or so, in other words go a little bit out, it’s at 25 and $28 a barrel. So it’s largely a financial squeeze. And they did get squeezed.
Jeff: (58:53)
So, would you like to see, however, Saudi Arabia and other countries make more cuts?
Donald Trump: (58:58)
We’ve already done that. Where, Saudi Arabia is cutting back, Russia is cutting back, Mexico is cutting back and the OPEC-plus, they call it OPEC plus additional states, are cutting back. And the problem is, nobody is driving the car anywhere in the world, essentially, 184 nations, factories are closed and businesses are closed. And so, all of a sudden we had really a lot of energy to start off with, oil in particular, we had a lot. And then all of a sudden, they lost 40/50% of their market, so it just stops. So, it’s going to be picking up and the energy business will be strong. But they cut back… It could be 20 million barrels, but it’s let’s say 15, and that was between Russia and Saudi Arabia. But this had to do with the squeeze and it was a very tough squeeze. So, a lot of people got-
Jeff: (59:46)
You don’t think they [inaudible 00:59:47] more right now.
Donald Trump: (59:48)
Well, they got to do more by the market, to be honest. Look, same thing over here. If the market is the way it is, people are going to slow it down or they going to stop. That’s going to be automatic, and that’s happening.
John: (59:59)
Mr. President, on criminal justice reform and these SBA loans, I got an email earlier this morning from a fella in the Northwest who owns a supply business. And he has a felony on his record, nonviolent felony, in the past five years. Which under SBA guidelines make him ineligible for one of these PPP loans, so he has now had to let go 50 employees, many of whom are criminals trying to get back into society. I don’t believe there’s anything in the CARES Act that would restrict-
Donald Trump: (01:00:29)
If you give me the name of the company and his name, I’ll have that checked out, John. I’ll do that. It’s a friend of yours?
John: (01:00:37)
No, not a friend of mine. No. Just somebody who contacted me [crosstalk 01:00:39] blue.
Donald Trump: (01:00:38)
Why did he call you? He called you to say he’s a criminal and why did he get along or what’s…
John: (01:00:42)
Because he wanted to apply for an SBA loan and couldn’t, and wondered how that squared with your-
Donald Trump: (01:00:47)
Okay. If you give me the name, I’ll look into it. I’d like to look into that.
Caitlin: (01:00:51)
I have a [crosstalk 01:00:52] country.
Donald Trump: (01:00:51)
Caitlin, go ahead.
Caitlin: (01:00:53)
If these companies that open and they have employees come back to work and they get sick, will these companies be liable?
Donald Trump: (01:00:58)
Which companies, you’re talking about? Under what?
Caitlin: (01:01:01)
Any companies that are manufacturing, any kind of company that [crosstalk 01:01:06] sick.
Donald Trump: (01:01:06)
So, we have… I’ll give you an answer to that. I’ll give you a legal answer to that when we look it up, but we’re trying to take liability away from these companies. We just don’t want that. Because we want the companies to open and open strong, but I’ll get you a legal opinion on that.
Caitlin: (01:01:18)
[crosstalk 01:01:17].
Donald Trump: (01:01:18)
I’ll get you… Well, that’s what I’m saying. I’ll get you a legal opinion on that.
Caitlin: (01:01:22)
You guys haven’t discussed that yet?
Donald Trump: (01:01:22)
Nobody has discussed it, no. But we will, now.
Caitlin: (01:01:25)
Have any business executives voiced concern to you about being liable potentially?
Donald Trump: (01:01:29)
Not one.
Caitlin: (01:01:29)
They didn’t [crosstalk 01:01:30] last week.
Donald Trump: (01:01:30)
Not at this point. But we’re going to look, because they have talked about general liability, so I’ll get you a specific answer from the lawyers. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 12: (01:01:38)
Thanks. [inaudible 01:01:38] to follow on oil. When you were talking earlier, you were talking about the PPP deal and then you mentioned the SPR and the first stimulus package even though you had announced that the-
Donald Trump: (01:01:53)
[crosstalk 01:01:52], but you know the price of oil right now, don’t you?
Speaker 12: (01:01:55)
I do. Do you know the price of oil…
Donald Trump: (01:01:58)
I do. I actually do.
Speaker 12: (01:01:58)
It’s negative $37.
Donald Trump: (01:02:00)
Of course, nobody has ever heard of negative oil before, but it’s for short-term.
Speaker 12: (01:02:05)
In your opening remarks, you were talking about the PPP deal and then you mentioned the 75 million barrels of oil that you previously had said you wanted to purchase.
Donald Trump: (01:02:15)
Yes.
Speaker 12: (01:02:15)
You weren’t able to get funding for that in the first deal. So I’m wondering, are you-
Donald Trump: (01:02:19)
Well, at the price you’re talking about, you don’t need funding. They pay you, see.
Speaker 12: (01:02:22)
You can, if you can go get it in the next 24 hours.
Donald Trump: (01:02:22)
Because, right now… Well, if you can get it, that’s true. If you can get it.
Speaker 12: (01:02:26)
So, my question… My first question is, are you asking for that funding as part of the [crosstalk 01:02:33].
Donald Trump: (01:02:32)
Well, at a minimum, we’ll let people store. So, we’ll store it. We’ll use it as storage and charge for it. But people need storage desperately, and we have massive storage under the petroleum.
Speaker 12: (01:02:43)
So you’re not going to make it a requirement of the PPP/NRM funding deal [crosstalk 01:02:47]?
Donald Trump: (01:02:47)
It’s not a question of requirement. If we could buy it for nothing, we’re going to take everything we can get. The only thing I like better than that is where they pay you to take the oil, but that’s a short term squeeze. You understand that. So, it’s… I don’t think you’re going to see that. But no, we’d like to have Congress… This is a great time to buy oil. And we’d like to have Congress approve it so that we could instead of just storing it for the big, usually the big companies… Because, I think we have 75 million gallons right now, capacity. That’s a lot. It’s… We’ve been building it up over a period of time, but that’s a lot. 75 billion barrels. So we’re going to get… Either ask for permission to buy it or we’ll store it. One way or the other, it will be full. Please.
Speaker 12: (01:03:30)
Mr. President, [crosstalk 01:03:32].
Donald Trump: (01:03:31)
Go ahead. [crosstalk 00:11:33], finish up. We’ll go right to you.
Speaker 12: (01:03:36)
Some senators, including Senator Cramer, have called on you to stop Saudi oil shipments that are on the way right now. Is that… You can do that under Section 232, is that something that you would consider-
Donald Trump: (01:03:45)
Well, we’ll look at it. I heard, just as I’m walking into the room, we certainly have plenty of oil. So I’ll take a look at that. Yes, please.
Speaker 11: (01:03:55)
Two questions. First on testing, the second on the SBA loan program. When will you or will you in fact invoke the DPA to force that company you mentioned, to ramp up production [crosstalk 00:12:05]?
Donald Trump: (01:04:05)
Well, we don’t… We really don’t need it. We use it, we go up… And I’ve used it a lot. But we use it and then sometimes all they have to do is see it coming. Do you want to talk about that admiral, please?
Admiral Giroir: (01:04:17)
I think this is… I don’t think any of us knew very much about the DPA. But they’re sort of a foresight of the DPA where you force a company to do something, but there’s a second side of it which is really a hand up. The company we’re talking about, have done… Has done everything to support this effort. And they’ve ramped up production, I’m on the phone with them multiple times a day. This is the hand up. This is the government coming in and saying, “How can we help you expand your lines?” There’s no asynchrony here at all. So this is the hand up side of the DPA, which is exactly what these small American heroic companies need. They don’t need to be forced. They’re all in. Their employees are all in.
Speaker 11: (01:04:58)
So, a point of clarity-
Donald Trump: (01:04:58)
And we don’t want to embarrass people either. Please Brad, go ahead.
Brad Smith: (01:05:02)
So today we were on site…Or that we had folks on site with that company, finishing out what their capital projections will be in order to be able to ramp up these additional four lines that I spoke about. That company will then turn in a white paper to the DOD that will then help move the process forward, but it’s actively in process.
Speaker 11: (01:05:20)
And I fully understand that the need is enormous. But on March 24th… March 21st, the administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March. So far, roughly 4 million people have been tested. So, where are the other 23 million or so tests? Did they not materialize? Are they in the pipeline? Help us understand that discrepancy.
Admiral Giroir: (01:05:39)
So, since I was the one who said that, let me explain where we were. So, I was getting my information, was correct information, about the actual tests that are in the marketplace. So, if you want to use those metrics, there’s been over ’40 million’ in the marketplace. But we have an end to end issue that we needed to deal with. And that’s what we’ve been dealing with, the swabs, the transport media… If we don’t have people utilizing the machines, the way Dr. Birx is talking about, we have some of our main platforms that are only 10% being utilized. You could have a lot of tests in the market and those are correct numbers, but if the machines aren’t utilizing them and they’re not organized at that level, then they’re not being utilized to its fullest. And that-
Donald Trump: (01:06:25)
So that way you meant, if the machines were utilized, that would be-
Admiral Giroir: (01:06:28)
You would have a lot of those millions of tests already being done. I think Ambassador Birx has estimated that we have another million tests a week just on one platform. That could be done if the machines were utilized more fully.
Speaker 13: (01:06:40)
I have a question for Admiral Giroir.
Donald Trump: (01:06:40)
For? Yes.
Speaker 13: (01:06:45)
Hi, Admiral Giroir. You said that there, and the vice president has said this and Mr. Smith said it, that there will be enough tests in place for phase one.
Speaker 14: (01:06:52)
There are.
Speaker 13: (01:06:53)
There are… The question is, what’s the standard of testing that you now have the capability for? Is it, test people who are only very ill? Is it test people who have the sniffles? Is it test people who come in just because they want to get a test? I mean, what is the standard here for the testing?
Admiral Giroir: (01:07:11)
It is the guidelines. But, I tried to be a little specific about this on Friday, and we all try to. Number one is, you need to test everyone who’s symptomatic, right? And you need to over test them, because-
Speaker 13: (01:07:22)
How symptomatic?
Admiral Giroir: (01:07:23)
We’re talking any symptoms that would be consistent with COVID, right? So… And there’s a wide range of symptoms, you want to test them and you want to over test. And we talked about the approximate metric with Ambassador Birx, fully supports because we… This is a good metric that you want to get about one positive for every 10 tests, then you know you over-sample. Second, and this is a really important part of the strategy, is because so many people are asymptomatic. There’s no way that you can test enough people to pull one asymptomatic out of 300 people in the population. So the strategy with… Ambassador Birx offered, and I talked to epidemiologist around the country, and they go, “Wow, I wish I would have thought of that.” Is to really focus on the vulnerable population where we know that the asymptomatic rate could be much higher than the rest of the population.
Admiral Giroir: (01:08:15)
And we are going to be focusing, and this is what my office does during normal times, focusing on the underserved populations, particularly in inner cities and urban areas, they have a higher rate because overcrowding, they can’t telework, they’re subject to a lot of comorbid conditions. Nursing homes, we all know about nursing homes and there’s both symptomatic and asymptomatic spread. And finally, some of our indigenous populations in the Indian Health Service. So this is a very important layer that most of the models and people don’t talk about, because that’s where we’re going to pick up the asymptomatic carrier tune. When you do that, that’s when you focus on track and trace.
Speaker 15: (01:08:53)
Sir, just a quick follow-up on that. If we have enough tests right now for everyone to go into phase one, why is the Governor of Maryland having to get half a million tests from South Korea?
Admiral Giroir: (01:09:02)
I don’t know what the Governor of Maryland is doing in South Korea, but there is excess capacity every day. If he wanted to send 30 or 40,000 tests to LabCorps and Quest, that could be done, that could be done tomorrow.
Speaker 15: (01:09:17)
[crosstalk 01:09:17] that they need it to start… To up their testing capacity and make it adequate. So they had to [crosstalk 01:09:22] South Korea.
Admiral Giroir: (01:09:22)
I think we’re seeing all across the country that in the states that have been hardest hit, their capacity… None of their capacity… They’re testing far exceeds South Korea, and they’ve been able to do that on a relatively straightforward basis. I don’t know what the Governor of Maryland… We talked to him today, he didn’t bring that up today.
Speaker 15: (01:09:40)
[crosstalk 01:09:39].
Admiral Giroir: (01:09:41)
We were on the governor’s call today?
Speaker 15: (01:09:43)
[inaudible 01:09:43] personally on this.
Speaker 16: (01:09:44)
[inaudible 01:09:45].
Mike Pence: (01:09:47)
We spoke to Governor Hogan today, I’ll follow up. Because I heard there was an announcement today about… That he had acquired some tests from overseas. Maybe we can put the slide back up that showed the number of facilities just in the State of Maryland. And part of our process, and I don’t know when the governor placed the order from South Korea, wouldn’t begrudge him or his health officials for ordering tests. But, the capacity of all the different laboratories and the number of machines that are across Maryland, was part of what we were communicating today. Including federal facilities, NIH is in Maryland, there’s Department of Defense facilities and… What we assured the governor then and we assured all the governors is that, we’ll open up all of those facilities. But, John back to your point. There was one other element of that, that’s the phase one testing. And I can’t really describe it as well as the doctors here, but it’s the contact tracing piece.
Mike Pence: (01:10:49)
Where we really believe that states that meet the criteria 14 days of cases going down and proper hospital capacity, if they test people that have symptoms and if they deploy resources to vulnerable populations, nursing homes and other designated vulnerable populations where we believe the threat of serious outcomes from the coronavirus is real. Then we also today informed the governors, that we will be deploying CDC teams to every state and every territory in the country to assist them in contact tracing. Governor Jared Polis raised a very good point about the legislation. The president is currently negotiating on Capitol Hill. He recommended that we make sure that the new bill that has some $25 billion in testing resources also cover contact tracing expenses by states. We assured him our administration strongly supports that. We communicated that to the Secretary of the Treasury and the rest of our negotiation team and we’ll be pursuing that.
Mike Pence: (01:11:54)
But we were able to tell every one of the governors that we will be deploying teams, we think of 10 or 12 for a start from CDC to reside in all of our states and territories to supervise and work with contractors and others to do the kind of contact tracing. So it’s test people that don’t feel well and they have the coronavirus, keep a careful eye and monitor your vulnerable populations. And when you come across a case, have a team on the ground that can do the immediate contact tracing and testing. And that’s how we restrain and contain the spread of the coronavirus during phase one. And frankly, it’s the beginning of the structure for how we contain the coronavirus going forward.
Speaker 15: (01:12:39)
Sir, just-
Donald Trump: (01:12:39)
And take a look at that map. If the Governor of Maryland could have called Mike Pence, he could have saved a lot of money. Look at all of the… Look at these different places, and that’s Maryland right there. So, he could have saved a lot of money, but that’s okay.
Speaker 15: (01:12:51)
So, you’re saying he didn’t need to go to South Korea for these testing kits.
Donald Trump: (01:12:53)
No, I don’t think he needed to go to South Korea. I think he needed to get a little knowledge, would have been helpful.
Speaker 15: (01:12:56)
[crosstalk 00:01:12:54].
Speaker 17: (01:12:57)
On the SBA loans, do you think it’s right that major corporations, major institutions like the [inaudible 01:13:01] restaurant chain, like Harvard University, apparently got a lot of money under the CARES Act, money that was supposed to be earmarked for small business owners, do you think that’s fair?
Donald Trump: (01:13:10)
Well, I know one thing, I didn’t get any, that’s for sure. I didn’t get any. We’ll look at individual things, and some people will have to return it if we think it’s inappropriate
Speaker 17: (01:13:18)
Or, should the criteria be changed so that money goes to people who need it the most?
Donald Trump: (01:13:21)
Well, it’s being done by great professionals, it’s being done by banks, and as you know community banks all over the country, they’re… That’s what they do. They loan money and they’re supposed to do it according to not only criteria, but according to what we think is right. But if somebody got something that we think is inappropriate, we’ll get it back. Good point. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 18: (01:13:40)
Yes. Another… A different question about South Korea. There are reports that you are personally negotiating with President Moon the terms of reduction of US Forces on the Korean Peninsula and that there are four scenarios involved, can you confirm that? And if so, what is your desired outcome?
Donald Trump: (01:13:56)
Well, I think that South Korea… I had a great talk with President Moon, he’s a friend of mine. I congratulate… He had a wonderful election victory. I was very happy about that. He was… As you know, just recently… No, we are negotiating for President Moon and for South Korea to help us monetarily. Because, we, as you know, we have 32,000 soldiers there, that varies from 28 to 32,000 in South Korea. And we think that… Before I came aboard, they paid very little, if anything. So we’re defending a wonderful nation, a nation that we have great relationships, but we’re asking them to pay for a big percentage of what we’re doing. It’s not fair. So, it’s not a question of reduction. It’s a question of will they contribute toward the defense of their own nation. We’re defending nations that are very wealthy. South Korea is a very wealthy nation. They make our television sets, they make ships, they make everything, and I give them great credit.
Donald Trump: (01:14:56)
We’ve been defending them for many decades, as you know, many… Over eight decades. And I’ve gone to them in the past. Last year I went to them and now they’re paying $1 billion a year. And I went to them again, I said, “Look, I’ll be back because that’s just a fraction.” And again, the relationship is a great, but it’s just not a fair relationship. We renegotiated the trade deal and made it a much more equitable deal than it was in the past. It was a terrible deal. It was done by Hillary Clinton. It was a terrible deal. The new deal is a much more equitable deal that’s on trade. But on the military, I mean, we’re paying for the military to defend another nation that’s 8,500 miles away. And they’re not the only one I’m talking to by the way, as you know. I won’t go into names. But I’ve done this, nobody talks about it.
Donald Trump: (01:15:45)
But I think it’s appropriate. I think the taxpayer of our country… Taxpayers want to hear these things. And so now, they’re… They’ve offered us a certain amount of money and I’ve rejected it. I just said, “It’s just… Look, we’re doing a tremendous service. We have a wonderful feeling and a wonderful relationship with each other, but we have to be treated equitably and fairly.” And so, that’s where it is right now. And what’s going to happen, I can’t tell you, but we’ll find out fairly soon. But, I congratulate the president who’s a friend of mine. I congratulate President Moon on having a terrific victory. Please.
Speaker 19: (01:16:22)
A question for you about Governor Cuomo’s visit, and then also a question for Dr. Birx, if you all may.
Donald Trump: (01:16:27)
Sure.
Speaker 19: (01:16:30)
The New York Governor along with the National Governors Association in the past have called for aid to be unrestricted as a lot of state and local governments see their revenues drop. Are you open to the idea of unrestricted aid or do you want it to be pandemic specific?
Donald Trump: (01:16:46)
Well, we’re going to be talking about that in phase four, as you know, which we’ll start very shortly. That has to do with infrastructure, hopefully infrastructure, because this country needs infrastructure. We spend all this money in the Middle East, $8 trillion, with a T, dollars in the Middle East. But if you have a pothole in a highway someplace, they don’t want you to spend the money to fix it. How stupid have we been in this country? How stupid have we been? And that’s changing rapidly, you know that, you’ve seen that. Including things like negotiating with friends. But when we are helping friends, friends should reimburse us for the cost.
Donald Trump: (01:17:23)
I mean, why should we be defending nations for free? We’re defending a nation for free. Now I’m getting $1 billion a year and we’re… We’ll be getting… We were offered much more than that, but I turned it down. So that’s where we are with that. As far as the other is concerned, look, we have to be smart in this country. We’ve been taken to the cleaner by every… And I mean, with allies, not just with the enemies, with allies. We’ve been to… Frankly, the allies have taken us much more so than the enemies. The enemies we don’t do business with, right? The allies we do business with… And whoever made these deals, whoever made these contracts, in many cases, we didn’t have a contract. We didn’t have a contract…
Donald Trump: (01:18:03)
In many cases, we didn’t have a contract, like we didn’t have a contract, we didn’t have a trade deal with China. They came in and they took $500 billion a year for many years, but anywhere from 200 to $550 billion a year out of our hides. Now we made this great trade deal. Unfortunately, that was a number of months ago and it’s a great deal. They’re paying 25% on $250 billion. A lot of things happening. They’re going to have to purchase $250 billion worth of goods, including farm product up to $50 billion. So a lot of good things are happening. But then what happened with China was the plague hit us, right, the plague. That was after. This was long after we signed the deal. The plague hit us, so I’m not happy about that. Okay. John, please.
John: (01:18:48)
A question for Dr. Birx, if I could. Dr Birx, a question on the virus itself. As it passes from patient to patient and mutates, over time have you picked up any indication that it has become less virulent? Have you picked up any indication it has become more virulent?
Dr. Birx: (01:19:07)
You know, that is an excellent question because we watch that all the time, particularly with RNA viruses, to really track its adaptation to humans. I mean, you’re really asking has this virus become more adapted to humans and more able to spread, or is it becoming less adapted to humans and less able to spread? We don’t have any indication that it’s less able to spread, and we’ll have good analyses that will come from, obviously the Roosevelt had its incident with the virus outside of the United States, and we’ll be able to look at those parameters, and the DOD and the military have done a great job in really ensuring the health of the sailors, but also ensuring thar these questions can really be asked and answered.
Dr. Birx: (01:19:54)
We have extraordinary evolutionary molecular biologists in this country all around the United States, and they’re looking at this very question, and a lot of the work that we’ve been doing and you’ll see a lot of work happening with testing in New Mexico and testing in other states. They have extraordinary molecular biologists that are evolutionary biologists, and they’ll be able to look at that both in New Mexico that may have lower transmission rates, and compare that to New York that has maybe 10 X the transmission. But it’s an excellent question and it’s something that will be able to be answered by what we see in the United States.
Donald Trump: (01:20:32)
John, what a good question that was. Where did that come from?
John: (01:20:35)
Every once in a while, I pull it out of my hat, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:20:36)
No, that’s very impressive. You know when Senator Schumer wrote a letter a couple of months ago and he said, “You should use admirals and generals.” I said, “Well, first of all, we have our Vice President has been incredible, but we have the admirals, we have the generals,” and I was just talking to the Admiral inside just before we came out. I said, “Did you go to Annapolis?” He said, “No, sir.” I said, “Oh, that’s too bad. That’s too bad. Where did you go?” He said, “I went to Harvard.” Oh, that’s okay too, I guess. Right? So you went to Harvard and he was a great student at Harvard. He’s doing a fantastic job. And this young gentleman was very, very successful, but he wanted to help the country. He wanted to come into the country and we appreciate it very much. He was a big success, big, big success. Let’s do here and there next. Okay. We’re all set. Go ahead.
Speaker 20: (01:21:27)
Thank you, Mr. President. I was hoping you talked about your meeting tomorrow with Governor Cuomo that you mentioned. Is there a reason he’s coming all the way down here?
Donald Trump: (01:21:33)
I don’t know. He wanted to [crosstalk 01:21:35] and we believe it or not, we get along, okay? He was very generous yesterday in particular, said we did a “phenomenal deal.” I don’t know if anybody wrote that, but he said that and I appreciated it because it’s not about me. It’s about these people and thousands behind Mike, and the Admiral, and all of the other people that are working with us. I mean, and you see it. Look, I don’t understand when I see a polling and approval ratings for the job. I mean, this group should get a 95. It really should. And we’re really helping the governors. And the governors call me, the ones I know, or the Republicans, but the ones I know, and they say it’s incredible the job you’re doing. Again, not me, the job this group is doing. And you sit here and I’m watching from the corner and I’m just saying, boy, it’s incredible stuff.
Donald Trump: (01:22:29)
When you watch the General get up, General Semonite, and talk about boom, boom, boom. You don’t see that. You don’t see that. When you hear the Admiral speak about the testing, how good it is, and yet people don’t like to say it. But remember, it was all about ventilators a month ago. Ventilators, ventilators, then we fixed it. You don’t hear about ventilators. Where is the ventilator? Jeff, you haven’t asked about ventilators recently. What’s going on? What about ventilators? We’re helping other countries now because they can’t have, they’re very hard to come by and they take a long time to make, like years.
Donald Trump: (01:23:02)
It’s incredible the job they’ve done, that our people have done, and also private companies have done. You know, you talk about the Act. We don’t like to use it unless we have to, but a lot of times just the fact that you have it, gets you everything you need. So you know, we don’t want to embarrass any of the companies, but we have used it on a number of occasions, and it worked. But it works just as well before you have to use it because they don’t want to be embarrassed and I don’t want to embarrass them because they’ve done a great job. Please go ahead.
Chanel Rion: (01:23:32)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:23:32)
No, I think Rick behind you. I promised. I cannot tell a lie. So I mean we’ll get you next. Okay?
Speaker 21: (01:23:38)
Are you talking to her or me?
Donald Trump: (01:23:38)
No no, you.
Speaker 21: (01:23:41)
Me, okay. Well, thank you so much, Mr. President. My question, I have two questions, the first one is on testing. You talked about the idea that first it was ventilators, now it’s testing. You seem to maybe possibly be implying that talking about testing as a personal attack on you. Can you explain why you think testing, talking about testing, is a personal attack given that the access to testing has been an issue for a long time. There’s bipartisan outcry still today that there’s not enough testing. Why do you think it’s a personal attack on you?
Donald Trump: (01:24:06)
Well, it’s not bipartisan. It’s mostly partisan, but more importantly than mostly partisan, it’s incorrect. You have the experts. Look at these maps. I mean, you have the maps with so many different locations. In the case of, as an example, Governor Hogan, he didn’t really know. It was very obvious to any of those listening to the call today, even though you weren’t supposed to be on it, I’m sure that some of you were, or representatives were, he really didn’t know about the federal laboratories. Would you say that’s correct, Mike? He didn’t know. He didn’t know and Mike doesn’t like to get into this stuff. He’s less controversial than I am, but he didn’t know about it. And if he did know about it, he would have been happy. No, we’ve done a really good job in testing. Now, with that being said, we have tests coming out perhaps over the next two weeks that will blow the whole industry away.
Donald Trump: (01:24:57)
Now, a lot of people love the Abbot tests. So do I. You know, the Abbott test is great because it’s boom, they touch, they put it in, in five minutes you have… The problem is that doesn’t do massive numbers like the big machine. But the big machine takes a day, takes a day and a half with delivery and everything else. But we have tremendous testing, tremendous testing capability. Remember this, we’ve tested more than any country in the world by far. In fact, I think I read where if you add up every other country in the world, we’ve tested more.
Donald Trump: (01:25:33)
But remember this, we’re dealing in politics. We’re dealing with a thing called November 3rd of this year. Do you know what November 3rd represents? Right? You know better than anybody in the room. November 3rd of this year, it’s called the presidential election. No matter what I do, no matter where we go, no matter how well we do, no matter what, if I came up with a tablet, you take it and this plague is gone, they’ll say Trump did a terrible job, terrible, terrible. Because that’s their soundbite. That’s the political soundbite. They know the great job we’ve done.
Donald Trump: (01:26:08)
But with all of that being said, and also, there is a thing that somebody could talk to if they want, but I don’t want to bore you with it. Not everybody believes we should do so much testing. You don’t need so much. We’re talking about maximum maximum. The reason that the Democrats and some others maybe because they don’t know, they want maximum because they want to be able to criticize, because it’s almost impossible to get to the maximum number, and yet we’ve been able to do it already. But with that, and you’ll be seeing this over the next, I think over the next couple of weeks or sooner, we have a test. If it comes out, it’ll revolutionize the whole world of testing. It’ll be something really special. So I don’t view it as personal at all. What I do say is it’s something that’s not fair to thousands of people that have done such a good job.
Speaker 21: (01:26:54)
That second question is about your language and how you approached the coronavirus at the beginning. I interviewed someone who said that his family got sick. They went to a funeral in mid-March. And they said mainly because the President wasn’t taking it serious, and he said, “If the President had had a mask on, if he was saying we should stay home, then I would have stayed home.” [crosstalk 01:27:13] But he said his family members were sick and because they were listening to you, do you feel like or are you concerned that downplaying the virus maybe got some people sick?
Donald Trump: (01:27:24)
And a lot of people love Trump, right? A lot of people love me. You see them all the time, right? I guess I’m here for a reason, you know. To the best of my knowledge, I won, and I think we’re going to win again. I think we’re going to win in a landslide. But just so you understand, you’re talking about March, right? And yet, [crosstalk 01:27:42] excuse me, excuse me. I know, I understand. And yet in January, a certain date, you know the date better than I do, we put on a ban of China where China can’t come in, and before March we put on a ban in Europe where Europe can’t come in. So how could you say I wasn’t taking it seriously? You know, I put on a ban on China before anybody in this country died. I put on a ban and so you tell me. Nancy Pelosi, she wanted to have a street party in Chinatown in San Francisco at the end of February.
Donald Trump: (01:28:18)
That’s a month later. And then they tell me it’s only a political talking point, but you feed into it because you’re too good a reporter to let that happen. Really, you are a good reporter. You’re too good a reporter to let that happen. Remember this. So at the end of January, I put on a ban. People that were in that room will tell you. I think there were 21 people. I was the only one in the whole room that wanted to do it. Fortunately, I was the one that counted for that purpose. We put on a ban because I was reading bad things about China. World Health Organization should have told us, but I was reading it with or without them. They should have known. All they had to do is read it. They didn’t have to even be there, but they tried to cover up for China.
Donald Trump: (01:28:55)
World Health covered up for China. [crosstalk 01:28:58] But no, no wait, but you can’t say this. I put on a ban. In other words, I stopped China from coming to the United States. I stopped Europe from coming into the United States long before the March date that you’re talking about. So people should say I acted very early. That was a very hard thing to do. Doing that was a very hard thing. I didn’t want to do that. [crosstalk 01:29:19] But I did it because I thought, and Dr. Fauci said that by doing it, President Trump saved tens of thousands of lives. So I did take it very seriously.
Speaker 21: (01:29:29)
You held rallies in February and in March. And there are some American-
Donald Trump: (01:29:32)
Oh, I don’t know about rallies. I really don’t know about rallies. I know one thing [crosstalk 01:29:35], I haven’t left the White House in months, except for a brief moment to give a wonderful ship, The Comfort-
Speaker 21: (01:29:43)
You held a rally in March.
Donald Trump: (01:29:45)
I don’t know. Did I hold a rally? I’m sorry. I hold a rally. Did I hold the rally? Let me tell you. In January when I did this, you had virtually no cases and no deaths, and yet I put it on. So how could I not? Why was Nancy Pelosi, right, Nancy Pelosi is holding a street fair. She wants a street fair in San Francisco in Chinatown to prove, you know what the purpose of it, was to prove that there’s no problem. Many other politicians did the same thing and wanted to prove [crosstalk 01:30:16] while I was… No, of course not. No, no, no. People are amazed at how early I acted and I did act early. With that being said, it’s very hard to say, let’s close down the greatest economy in the history of the world. I had it closed down, I and everybody else that works with me, and close to 350 million people built the greatest economy in the history of the world, best employment numbers, best stock market numbers, best numbers in virtually every category, even good manufacturing numbers.
Donald Trump: (01:30:48)
The previous administration said manufacturing was dead for our country, even great manufacturing numbers and you know what? I did that and somebody walked into my office and said, “Sir, you’re going to have to close down the economy. You’re going to have to close the country.” But you know what I say to you? We’re going to rebuild it, and we’re going to rebuild it better, and it’s going to go faster than people think. I built it once. I build it a second time. Please.
Chanel Rion: (01:31:11)
Mr. President, thank you, Chanel Rion with One America News.
Donald Trump: (01:31:14)
Please. Go ahead.
Chanel Rion: (01:31:17)
Going back to the topic of friendship and bipartisanship, Americans with the exception of Pelosi, Schumer and even Romney, Americans have seen an unprecedented chapter of bipartisanship and cooperation on the political landscape. On a personal note, what has been the most significant signal that your relationship with Democrats [inaudible 01:31:39] level have changed for the good of America?
Donald Trump: (01:31:42)
I think it’s a great question because there is bipartisanship. Look, we’re getting the paycheck plan. It’s already 350 billion was approved, essentially unanimously, and we have another 250 which I think you’re going to find out is going to be a higher number than that. Okay. I won’t say it now because I don’t know if they’ve released it or not, but it’s going to end up being more than 250 billion, and this is going to small businesses, and is going to workers, and these are really bipartisan plans. It’s a great thing that’s happening. So I think the fact that we’re able to do all of this in a bipartisan way is great.
Donald Trump: (01:32:18)
Now the tax cuts that the Republicans did, we had no help from the Democrats. So you can’t say that’s bipartisan, but this whole thing getting our country back, and you know, Nancy Pelosi’s been, she’s very nasty. She wasted a lot of time with a impeachment hoax. It was a total hoax, went nowhere, and that was not good. And Schumer, I guess it’s the same thing, but he sort of accepted it. He just did what he was supposed to do and he didn’t do very well with it. But you know, that was not appropriate. That was a bad thing for our country. But it was fine. I mean, I understand the game. They have a little bit of a majority, so they say, let’s do something and let’s try and stir it up.
Donald Trump: (01:32:58)
But they wasted a year. They wasted tremendous. We could have been doing things that would have been great for our country. They could have been looking into China. They should have been looking into China as an example. A lot of people are blaming the Democrats for wasting all that time because it was during that period of time, as you know, that it was fomenting, but I think we’ve had a great spirit of bipartisanship in a certain way.
Donald Trump: (01:33:21)
I wouldn’t say we’re going to set records throughout the world, but things are happening that are very good. The country is coming together, and I’ll tell you what, the people are coming together. The people are really coming together. I think you’re going to find that our country is much more unified. I do think that the press, the media foments a lot of anger. I really believe it foments tremendous anger. For instance, I’ll be asked a tremendously hostile question from somebody, and then I’ll answer it in a hostile way, which is appropriate. otherwise you look foolish. Otherwise it looks like just walk off the stage and bow your head. I can’t do that. You know? I just can’t do that. But a lot of these questions that are asked from certain networks are so hostile and there’s no reason for it.
Donald Trump: (01:34:10)
There’s no reason for it. We are in a war. This is a World War II. This is a World War I, where by the way, the war essentially ended because of a plague. That was one of the worst ever. They lost almost a hundred million people. But we’re in a big war. And I’ll say one thing about, because I think it’s important, the last person, I did it early, but I was the last person that wanted to close down one of the great economic, you can’t call it an experiment, but everything I guess in life is an experiment. So let’s say experiments, but one of the great economic stories in history, I’m the last person that wanted to do it, but we did the right thing, because if we didn’t do it, you would’ve had a million people, a million and a half people, maybe two million people dead.
Donald Trump: (01:34:59)
Now we’re going toward 50, I’m hearing, or 60,000 people. One is too many. I always say it. One is too many, but we’re going toward 50 or 60,000 people. That’s at the lower, as you know, the low number was supposed to be 100,000 people. We could end up at 50 to 60. Okay, it’s horrible. If we didn’t do what we did, we would have had, I think, a million people, maybe 2 million people, maybe more than that. And you look it, there’s one country in particular that decided let’s wing it. Let’s just keep going. They are being inundated with death.
Donald Trump: (01:35:43)
Now if you take a look at some of the hospitals, where one of them I knew growing up in Queens, and I’m looking at the bodies laying in hallways being brought into refrigerator trucks, the trucks, these massive trucks, bodies going in, multiply that times 10. It’s not sustainable. And many of the people that have this theory, Oh let’s, you know, maybe we could have just gone right through. I was somebody that would have loved to have done that, but it wouldn’t have been sustainable. You can’t lose a million people. That’s almost double what we lost in the Civil War. I use that as a guide, Civil War, 600,000 people died. So it’s not sustainable.
Donald Trump: (01:36:28)
But it could have been much more than a million people. I mean if you took a number and cut it in half and half and in half again, you’d end up at 500,000 people, okay, if you want to make a very conservative guesstimate. 500,000 people is not acceptable. Is that a correct sort of an analogy? So I mean I see it all the time. My friends of mine, people that I have great respect for. Well we could have done this, we could have done, and remember this, when we say 50 and they compare 50 to the 35 of the flu, because it’s averaged 35, 36,000 over a 10 year period. It’s a lot. Who would think that?
Donald Trump: (01:37:03)
But we’re not talking about with the flu. It just goes. We’re not locking ourselves in our units. We’re not locking ourselves in our apartments and not moving and not touching anybody and just saying, you know, the world. In this case we are, and we’re still going to lose between 50 and 60, but if we just kept it going on a normal basis, which is really the only standard that you can compare it to with the flu, because that was a normal basis. You get into an airplane, you travel to Florida, you go to Texas, you go wherever you’re going. But in this case, if we didn’t do anything, the number wouldn’t be 50 to 60,000, the number would be a million people dead. It would be 1,000,005, 1,000,002, maybe 700,000. It would have been a number in like that, and it’s so important because I see so much.
Donald Trump: (01:37:57)
Oh well, you know. You can’t compare it because I’ll tell you what, the people of this country, what they’ve done, they’ve gone out of their had the way they’ve lived. It’s not great. It’s terrible. Maybe the first three days, they’re all of a sudden, you see what’s going on. They want to get going, and I get that fully. But I just say this. If we would have done that, we would’ve lost anywhere from a million to more than two million people. Now, with all of the death that we’ve seen at 50 or 60,000 people heading toward, right now it’s at 40, but 50 or 60,000 people, probably over 54, and [inaudible 01:38:37], but that’s with our guard up. If we took our guard down and just said, “Okay, we’re just going to keep this open,” we would have lost millions of people.
Donald Trump: (01:38:47)
Can you imagine? Look how bad it looks now when you look at the bodies, when you look at Hart Island in New York where they have the mass grave, and all of the things that you see, can you imagine if we had the guard down, if we didn’t do anything and we just said, “Let’s ride it out?” It would not have been sustainable in any way. It would have been an atrocity. So we’ve done the right thing. We’ve really done the right thing. And the people that have worked so hard and dangerously, I’ll tell you again, I say it, but I watched those doctors and nurses and medical people running into those hospitals, and they don’t even have that gear on. Forget about gear, whether it’s great gear or not, and we’re bringing in the best gear in the world, but they’re running in with open everything.
Donald Trump: (01:39:35)
I mean, the job, they like warriors, the job they’re doing. But if we didn’t do the moves that we made, you would have had a million, a million and a half, 2 million people dead. So multiply that times 50, you’re talking about you would’ve had 10 to 20 to 25 times more people dead than all of the people that we’ve been watching. That’s not acceptable. The 50,000 is not acceptable. It’s so horrible. But can you imagine multiplying that out by 20 or more? It’s not acceptable. So it’s a very good question. I appreciate it. We’ll see you tomorrow. We’ll see you tomorrow.
Mike Pence: (01:40:26)
Thanks, everybody."
"Apr 16, 2020",5:35 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (03:19)
Thank you very much. Our nation is engaged in a historic battle against the invisible enemy. To win this fight, we have undertaken the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And that’s exactly what it’s been. We’ve marshaled every instrument of American power. And we’ve unleashed her most potent weapon of all, the courage of the American people. These have been trying times. A cruel virus from a distant land has unfairly claimed thousands of precious American lives. To every citizen who has lost a cherished loved one, your pain is our pain. We mourn as one national family. Our country has come together. We draw our solace from the faith that God has received and the departed… He has taken the departed into his eternal and loving embrace. They will never be forgotten. Over the last weeks and months, millions of Americans have joined together in a shared national sacrifice to halt the spread of this horrible disease.
Donald Trump: (04:43)
The Army built field hospitals and sports arenas and convention centers. The Army Corps of Engineers, is great. Over 20,000 beds in record time. The Navy sailed hospital ships to our biggest cities. Lifesaving supplies and experimental medicines were rushed to the front lines, as we launched a rapid search for groundbreaking treatments and vaccines. We built the most advanced and robust testing anywhere in the world and we’ve done more testing than any country anywhere in the world. We suspended dangerous foreign travel. We leveraged our industrial base to produce vast quantities of critical medical gear. And enacted a historic $2 trillion relief package. Through it all, we have seen the heroism of our doctors and nurses like never before. These are our warriors. The bravery of our truck drivers, such bravery, and food suppliers, such incredible bravery, and the determination and drive of our citizens. Through this unified national endeavor, we have made great progress. You could really say, incredible progress. Our experts and scientists report that our strategy to slow the spread has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Models predicted between 1.5 million and 2.2 million US deaths. If there was no mitigation, could have even been higher than that. And between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths with mitigation, it’s looking like we will come far under even these lowest numbers. Thanks to our all-out military operation and the extraordinary devotion of our people, we believe we will experience far fewer deaths than even the optimistic projection, but there is no such thing as an optimistic projection on death. One person is too many. Our experts say the curve has flattened and the peak in new cases is behind us. Nationwide, more than 850 counties or nearly 30% of our country, have reported no new cases in the last seven days. Because of our early and aggressive action, we have avoided the tragedy of healthcare rationing and deadly shortfalls that have befallen many other nations. Nations which wherever possible, we are helping. In America, no person who was needed a ventilator, has been denied a ventilator.
Donald Trump: (07:56)
We’re making hundreds of thousands of ventilators. We’ve delivered thousands and thousands of ventilators to the states, and actually it’s been an incredible operation. We started with very little and we ended with a lot. The United States has achieved a significant lower mortality rate than almost all other countries. Based on the latest data, our team of experts now agrees that we can begin the next front in our war, which we are calling, Opening Up America Again. And that’s what we’re doing. We’re opening up our country, and we have to do that. America wants to be open and Americans want to be open. As I have said for some time now, a national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution. To preserve the health of our citizens, we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy over the long haul. You can’t do one without the other, cannot be done.
Donald Trump: (09:10)
To keep vital supply chains running, these chains have to be taken care of so delicately. They’re delicate. The balance is delicate. We want to deliver food and medical supply. We must have a working economy and we want to get it back very quickly, and that’s what’s going to happen. I believe it will boom. A prolonged lockdown combined with a forced economic depression, would inflict an immense and wide ranging toll on public health. This includes a sharp rise in drug abuse, alcohol abuse, suicide, heart disease, and many other dimensions of physical and mental wellbeing. Moreover, many patients have put needed medical care on hold, creating entirely new hazards for public health. Our country has suffered, the world has suffered. 184 other countries have suffered. Therefore, my administration is issuing new federal guidelines that will allow governors to take a phased and deliberate approach to reopening their individual states. I’ve dealt with them now a long time and we’ve had a great relationship.
Donald Trump: (10:39)
Democrat, Republican, the relationship has been good. This strategy is based on hard, verifiable data. I want to thank, Dr. Birx, for her incredible leadership in crafting these guidelines in consultation with scientists, experts and medical professionals across government. Dr. Birx will explain the guidelines in more detail in a few moments. And Dr. Fauci has been absolutely terrific, we’ve all worked together and we’ve worked together well. They are interested in the health of our country and we’re all interested in the viability and making us truly great again. We took the greatest economy in the history of the world and we closed it in order to win this war, and we’re in the process of winning it now. Our approach outlines three phases in restoring our economic life. We are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time. And some states will be able to open up sooner than others.
Donald Trump: (11:52)
Some states are not in the kind of trouble that others are in. Now that we have passed the peak in new cases, we’re starting our life again, we’re starting rejuvenation of our economy again, in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion. Our strategy will continue to protect senior citizens and other vulnerable populations while allowing military and other groups of incredibly talented people, to go about their real business. And the business that’s supposed to be, hard at work at doing, and nobody does it better. Our military is the greatest anywhere in the world, and we’re so thankful for what they’ve done. Healthy Americans will now be able to return to work as conditions on the ground allow. Instead of a blanket shutdown, we will pursue a focus on sheltering the highest risk individuals, so important. We’re establishing clear scientific metric and benchmarks on testing new case growth and hospital capacity that must be met before advancing to each phase, and that’s each phase specifically, in the reopening of our country.
Donald Trump: (13:25)
This is a gradual process. As the case load in a state continues to go down, restrictions can continue to be eased and come off. Throughout the process, citizens will continue to be called upon to use all of their weapons in this war. Vigorous hygiene, teleworking when possible, staying at home if you feel sick, maintaining social distance, sanitizing commonly used surfaces and being highly conscious of their surroundings. Those are our weapons and they’re very powerful weapons, indeed. Governors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states. Every state is very different. They’re all beautiful. We love them all, but they’re very different. If they need to remain closed, we will allow them to do that. And if they believe it is time to reopen, we will provide them the freedom and guidance to accomplish that task and very quickly depending on what they want to do.
Donald Trump: (14:35)
We are also encouraging states to work together to harmonize their regional efforts. We’ll have numerous cases where states have worked and we’ll be working very closely together. As we reopen, we know that there will be continued hardships and challenges ahead. Our goal will be to quickly identify and address any outbreaks and put them out rapidly. If the virus returns in the fall as some scientists think it may, possibly, these guidelines will ensure that our country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly. At the heart of our strategy is the vital role of medical research, especially for therapies that will significantly improve outcomes for high risk patients and reduce the need for urgent care. This will be tremendously valuable in allowing life to eventually return to normal. At least 35 clinical trials are already underway including, antiviral therapies, immune therapies and blood therapies in the form of convalescent plasma.
Donald Trump: (15:55)
You’ve all heard about some of these events and some of these therapies, they’ve come a long way. What’s been done in the last four weeks is incredible. We will also continue to expand our testing capacity. We have now completed more than 3.5 million tests, by far the most anywhere in the world. Areas of our country that have been hotspots have done much more testing on a per capita basis than South Korea. We’ve done more than South Korea. And South Korea has done a good job, but we’ve done more. We will continue to work with governors to advise them on how to conduct both surveillance and diagnostic testing. We have now distributed over 600,000 Abbott ID Now point-of-care diagnostic tests. These are tests that are done on site, and within five minutes you know the answer, positive or negative. In recent days, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of tests performed by hospitals and academic institutions with more than 120,000 tests recently reported in a single day, far more than any country in the world has ever been able to do. And our numbers are actually going up.
Donald Trump: (17:24)
As these new and better testing solutions come online, we’re seeing this additional capacity reflected in the numbers. For this reason, the number of tests processed in commercial laboratories has dropped from approximately 100,000 to roughly 75,000 tests over the last week. The reason it dropped is because we have so many other tests and we don’t even have to go through the laboratories, but the laboratories have tremendous additional capacity and states feel free to use that capacity. Some in the media falsely reported this as a bad thing when in fact it is a great thing. Because it indicates that the states are moving to faster more local testing solutions including, on the spot tests. So this drop in the utilization of commercial laboratories is an affirmation that testing, which is at an all-time high, is growing at a historic rate. In other words, the laboratories are great, but now we have forms of testing that are much quicker, much better, and we don’t have to use the laboratories, but they’re there and they have a great capacity to do the work.
Donald Trump: (18:45)
As Dr. Birx has been advising our governors for weeks, we continue to have an excess testing capacity of 1 million tests per week available for use. And our capabilities are growing every single day, especially with the new tests that are coming onto the market rapidly. As we begin a science-based reopening, we must be extra vigilant in blocking the foreign entry of the virus from abroad. Border control, travel restrictions and other limitations on entry are more important than ever to keep the virus in check and allow Americans to get back to work. The sacrifices our citizens have made in this time of crisis will be remembered, studied, honored, and praised for generations to come. We’re really all working together. Democrat, Republican, conservative, liberal, we’re all working together. This is not about parties, this is about our country. Now the American people are ready to rise to the occasion once again. They are ready to show the world once more that Americans can defeat any challenger. Together, we will rebuild this land that we love.
Donald Trump: (20:03)
Together, we will rebuild this land that we love. We will reclaim the magnificent destiny that we share, and we will carry our nation forward to new heights of greatness and glory. I would now like to ask Vice President, Mike Pence and Dr. Birx to further explain the new guidelines. I want to thank Dr. Birx, I want to thank Dr. Fauci, And I want to thank really especially a man who has devoted 24 hours a day to his task force and done such an incredible job, our great Vice President Mike Pence. Please, Mike.
Mike Pence: (20:49)
Thank you, Mr. President. The members of the White House coronavirus task force today, join the president to meet with my partisan group of members of the House and of the Senate to get their counsel on the development of what the president unveiled to America’s governors this afternoon. The new guidelines for opening up America again are a product of the best science and the best common sense that the president has marshaled on this team, and from a broad range of advisors from all across the nation.
Mike Pence: (21:26)
From the moment president Trump established the White House coronavirus task force, early on, he made it clear that we have no higher priority than the health and safety of the American people. President launched a whole of government approach. And while we stand here on this day with more than 640,000 Americans having contracted the coronavirus, and our hearts go out to the families of the more than 31,000 Americans who lost their lives and those who continue to struggle with serious consequences of the coronavirus.
Mike Pence: (22:02)
The truth is that because of the decisive action that our president took early on, suspending travel from China and thereafter from portions of Europe and South Korea, screening passengers, and because of the strong actions in partnership with every governor across America, because of the extraordinary efforts of America’s healthcare workers on the front lines, and because of the cooperation of the American people and God’s grace, we are slowing the spread. We are flattening the curve.
Mike Pence: (22:41)
We have preserved the capacity of our healthcare system, and we protected the most vulnerable. In a word, because of the actions of this president, this administration, governors at every level, our healthcare workers and our fellow Americans. We’ve saved lives, and every American should be comforted by that. And we can see it in the numbers. In the charts that I’ll present today, these three maps track influenza-like illness, which in this instance is mostly coronavirus across America.
Mike Pence: (23:19)
The first map reflects the total number of cases on the week ending March the 28th. The next map reflects our data about the total number of cases on the week ending April 4th. And we stand here today with the final map reflecting the total number of cases across America as of April the 11th. With these trends underway, President Trump tasked the White House coronavirus task force to develop new guidelines for opening up America again.
Mike Pence: (23:51)
Those guidelines were presented today first to our nation’s governors. And it is our intention at the president’s direction to provide these guidelines to assist governors and state health officials in evaluating the most responsible manner to reopen the economies of their States at a time and manner of their choosing. The guidelines as Americans who are looking on will note, begin with what is the best criteria that our experts have developed? A downward trajectory in cases over a 14 day period of time, ensuring that States have proper capacity in their health care facilities.
Mike Pence: (24:32)
The second set of proposals includes a description of recommendations for state preparedness. And let me say to the American people what President Trump made clear to our governors today, that our administration will continue to work day in and day out through our task force, through FEMA, to ensure that our states have not only the medical supplies, but that we continue to rapidly expand testing across the nation.
Mike Pence: (25:05)
The president have reflected on the progress we’ve made on testing, but a few statistics for that as well, which I hope are an encouragement to the American people. On March 11th, we had performed a total of 23,588 tests. Because of the public private partnership that President Trump initiated with commercial labs across the country, that number was 83,500 by March 18th. And as the president just said, that number is 3.5 million today. It is our expectation that we will have tested more than 5 million Americans before the end of the month of April, and we’ll continue to scale those resources.
Mike Pence: (25:40)
So testing and medical supplies will continue to be an ongoing partnership with our states and we want our healthcare workers and people all across the country to know of our commitment to that. Finally, the president directed us to propose a phased approach to reopening our economy. It is based on up to date data and readiness, and will continue to provide the very best data to our states, working with their health officials.
Mike Pence: (26:12)
The focus is on the mitigation of any risk of resurgence or the emergence of the coronavirus in states where it’s not yet emerged. There is a focus in the president’s new guidelines on the most vulnerable. And we made this very clear to the governors today. These new guidelines for opening up America again can be implemented on a state wide basis or on a county by county basis.
Mike Pence: (26:41)
And with that, I’m happy to turn it over to dr Deborah Birx. And if I may, Mr. President, I’d like to also extend my admiration and appreciation to Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, and every member of our task force that worked around the clock to develop these recommendations for opening up America where I know every American is grateful for your leadership and for theirs. Deborah.
Dr. Birx: (27:07)
Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. We’re going to go through these quickly because I know you have them and many of you have already spoken to them on television. Next slide, please. This is a very important slide. It talks about the gatekeeping on the gatekeeping criteria to moving into phase one. It’s very much related to what you just saw about influenza-like illness.
Dr. Birx: (27:33)
And the United States has been tracking influenza-like illness is through the Centers of the Disease Control for years. Both the state and public health officials are used to watching this. County health officials are used to watching it, and frankly, every family around the United States knows how to access this on the CDC website in order to get up to date information to the communities.
Dr. Birx: (27:55)
It also looks at a syndromic emergency room type visits. Again, housed at the CDC, and really is our surveillance program that can be utilized for a lot of different illnesses, but in this case will be utilized for respiratory diseases. In addition, we are tracking the number of cases and it must have a downward trajectory for 14 days, as well as the influenza-like illness and the syndromic illnesses. And a downward trajectory and the number of positive tests with persistence of high levels of testing.
Dr. Birx: (28:26)
For the hospitals, it’s to ensure that we can treat all patients without resorting to any crisis care, and ensuring that there’s a robust testing program in place for at risk healthcare workers, including front line responders with the emerging antibody tests. Next slide. Now, just to show you what this looks like. So what the CDC did for me under the direction of Bob Redfield was to chart what would the syndromic illnesses were reporting throughout the early part of March.
Dr. Birx: (28:58)
And you can see in New Orleans, respiratory diseases were starting to be seen in the emergency room. That is the red line. The cases are shown in the dark blue line. The gray mountain is testing, and underneath that is the blue mountain of positives. And you can see that the early alert was present from the emergency room about early respiratory disease. You can see it predated the cases. So throughout the summer, when we do not have flu to contaminate this picture, we’ll be able to follow the syndromic pattern city by city, county by county, community by community, state by state.
Dr. Birx: (29:39)
Next slide. In addition, the CDC has the influenza-like illness net distributed throughout the United States. Very useful in the winter time. That first peak is influenza B in the red. That’s this season. I showed you all this seasons here, so you could see the seasons as they are displayed. The first peak is influenza B, second peak is influenza A, and then you can see the coronavirus. And you can see its decline, and it’s declining towards baseline. This will allow us, again, city by city, community by community, state by state, to look for variations in an early response mode in those localities that I described.
Dr. Birx: (30:24)
Next slide. So hopefully you see that we’ve brought on CDC and their amazing talent of individuals at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and all of their abilities to this response, and also to the surveillance that we need in this response. But I want to call your attention to the third bullet on this graphic. So we’re tracking those two pieces that I described. But the third bullet is about setting up Sentinel Surveillance sites to be able to distinguish and find asymptomatic individuals, individuals that you’ve heard about that may be either presymptomatic or asymptomatic throughout their entire disease course.
Dr. Birx: (31:05)
We want to be able to find them in communities of particular vulnerability. So we’ll be doing Sentinel Surveillance throughout nursing homes, throughout inner city federal clinics, throughout indigenous populations, to really be able to find early alerts of asymptomatic individuals in the community and both for the syndromic cases that are tested, the flu influenza-like cases, and the asymptomatic cases doing contact tracing again with support from the Centers for Disease Control, working with each state and local government.
Dr. Birx: (31:39)
In addition, we want to make sure that all the healthcare facilities have adequate personal protective devices and the equipment to handle the surge, and to ensure the ICU can handle increased capacity. We want every state to have a plan for the health and safety of its workers in critical industries, and to protect the health and safeties of those living in high risk facilities, including senior care facilities as we discussed with Sentinel Surveillance, but also additional surveillance.
Dr. Birx: (32:10)
When we talked with all of the states that had not had a major metro outbreak, their Sentinel Surveillances picked up always the first cases in nursing homes. And so this is a very much a big focus of the plan moving forward. I won’t go into the rest of the details on this slide, but there’s quite a bit of detail on the expectations of every state and local government.
Dr. Birx: (32:33)
Next slide. You’ll recognize this slide. Next slide, please. You’ll recognize this slide, it’s what we’ve been talking about in the 15 and 30 days to prevent the spread. It’s continuing those in critical hand-washing, our sanitizer, avoiding touching your face at all times, disinfecting surfaces, using face covering while in public, following state and local guidelines, and critically staying home if you are sick. I know a lot of people go to the workplace when they are feeling ill. You know when you’re feeling ill. It won’t get better by going to work, so we’re asking again for people to stay home when they’re sick.
Dr. Birx: (33:16)
Next slide is for employers. To ensure that there can be social distancing and protective equipment, temperature checks, use of disinfectant in high traffic areas including break rooms, and ensuring that there’s no non-essential business travel, and then monitoring for any symptomatic individuals in the workplace. And again, if you become ill at work, to immediately to go home. And ensure that there’s contact tracing of all the individuals that become sick.
Dr. Birx: (33:46)
I’m going to go the through the phases very quickly, but you have the details. Phase one. Again, you have to go through those gating criterias related to 14 days of decreasing evidence of illness and decreasing testing despite adequate testing. So phase one begins with all vulnerable individuals, including those with co-morbidities, continuing to shelter in place, and ensuring that those that first go out into the public are not those that are most vulnerable to bad outcomes in this disease. And then ensuring that we continue to do six feet maximum physical distancing in public spaces, continuing to avoid large gatherings, and all non-essential travel for the employers.
Dr. Birx: (34:29)
Next slide. Again, if a vulnerable population needs to return to work and cannot be teleworking, there should be special accommodations for all vulnerable populations as well as options for teleworking. We believe every employee should encourage work return in phases from 20% or 25% to 40% to 50%. And again, minimize all non-essential travel.
Dr. Birx: (34:57)
Phase one continued. Next slide. If the schools are already closed, they should remain closed. All visits to senior living facilities and hospitals should be continued to be prohibited. Large venues including sit down dining can only be operated under strict physical distancing protocols and maintaining those six feet. Gyms could open if again adhere to strict physical distancing, and elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient basis.
Dr. Birx: (35:27)
Phase two. Next slide. Next slide. Again, you have to go through the criteria again of a continuation of another 14 day decline. Among those criterias that were in the gating. Again, we’re asking for all vulnerable individuals shelter in place. We did not put a timeline on any of the phases. We want the governors with the data that they have, community by community, to be setting up those timelines. Again, we’re asking for the public to continue to maximize physical distance. However, we increased social settings to be able to now have 50 individuals and nonessential travel can resume.
Dr. Birx: (36:09)
Next slide. This is for the employers. We still would like to encourage telework and the common areas should remain close or be physically distance. All nonessential travel for employees can kind of resume and then again special accommodations for vulnerable.
Dr. Birx: (36:28)
Next slide. This should be a relief to many households that have small children. Schools, day cares, and camps can reopen in phase two. Visits to senior living facilities however, should remain and hospitals prohibited. Large venues can operate, but solely under moderate physical distancing, and elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient and inpatient basis.
Dr. Birx: (36:54)
Phase three. And so phase three I won’t go through in detail, which is essentially returning to our new normal with all of the what we talked about through all phases. Continuing the good hygiene practices, continuing the respect for spaces between individuals. Because we know that we still have an issue with asymptomatic spread.
Dr. Birx: (37:18)
I do believe with this plan that we’re both confronting the issue of finding symptomatic individuals through our networks with early alert as well as those who come and present to different hospitals and emergency room with testing and contact tracing, but critically have put in place what we believe is a safety net through asymptomatic Sentinel Surveillance that is centered around our most vulnerable groups between nursing homes and native, our Native American and indigenous populations and our inner city groups that we know may be in multigenerational households and have unique risk. I’ll stop there, Mr. President.
Dr. Fauci: (38:03)
Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. So as you’ve seen just now from the detail presentation from Dr. Birx, this is a rather robust program for reentering into normality. There’s a lot of details here, and I know it’ll take a little bit time to digest them all. So what I thought would be good since I really want to be brief to allow time for questions, is to kind of take us back to the discussions that we’ve had here before, and why this is a natural evolution from what we had said before.
Dr. Fauci: (38:37)
You might recall that on a few occasions when I was up here before you, I told you that when we get to the point where we’re going to take those steps towards trying to get back to some form of normality, that it would not be a light switch that you could turn on and off. I meant that in two different components. The first of all that we are a very large country, and we have different dynamics in the country. We have areas of the country that have gone through a terrible ordeal, and others that fortunately have gotten through this rather lightly. So that’s the first thing.
Dr. Fauci: (39:17)
The second thing is that light switch on and off is the exact opposite of what you see here, which is a gradual gradation with the first thing and the only thing in mind as the health people here, my colleagues who are either physician, scientists, or public health issues, the predominant and completely driving element that we put into this was the safety and the health of the American public. And I know there are a lot of other considerations that go into opening, considerations that you’ve heard of from this podium. But the dominating drive of this was to make sure that this is done in the safest way possible. So let me just make a couple of comments to just reiterate more from a broader standpoint.
Dr. Fauci: (40:03)
To just reiterate more from a broader standpoint the things that Dr. Birx did so well in a very granular detail. First of all, in order to even consider getting into the phasing, you have to pass a hurdle and that’s the hurdle that we refer to as gating in. Now, when you think about it and look at the map of the country and look at the differences in different parts of the country, you will see that there are some regions, states, locations that are going to be almost already into some of that gating and will have already fulfilled some of those criteria. Others, because of the dynamics of the outbreak in the area, will take longer to be able to do that, but you don’t get to phase one until you get through the gating. And then, in order to make sure that safety and health is the dominant issue, the design of the phases where just that. You go into phase one if you get no rebound and you satisfy the gating for yet again a second time, then you go to phase two. If you have no rebound and you satisfy the gating criteria for a third time, you go into phase three.
Dr. Fauci: (41:14)
So, there are multiple checkpoints of safety there. So, as I’ve said from this podium when we were talking about the first 15 days of the mitigation and then we extended it another 30 days, I essentially pleaded with the American public to say, let us make sure we do the best that we can to accomplish that. And in fact, mitigation works. You saw the charts that the vice president and that Dr. Birx put up. It worked and what we hope and I believe we will be successful, if we carefully do this again with the attention to the safety and health of the American public that we will be able to. It will be staggered. Not every state, not every region is going to do it at the same time.
Dr. Fauci: (42:01)
That’s clearly obvious because of the very dynamics of the outbreak, but we feel confident that sooner or later, we will get to the point hopefully sooner, with safety as the most important thing, to a point where we can get back to some form of normality. The one thing I liked about it that Dr. Birx said so well is that no matter what phase you’re in, there are certain fundamental things that we’ve done that are not like it was in September and October. You want to call it the new normal. You can call it whatever you want, but even if you are in phase one, two, three. It’s not, okay, game over. It’s not. It’s going to be a way that we protect ourselves because as we know and as I’ve said from this podium, it may very well be as we go the cycle around that there’ll be this virus that wants to come back to us. I think we’re going to be able to handle that. Thank you.
John: (42:54)
Go ahead, Dr. [Inaudible 00:03:06]. So, I assume that there’s also a phase four which is after a vaccine is developed and available to everybody. So, the question on phase three being the new normal, are we during that phase going to be able to see things like packed arenas for sporting events, large crowds, concerts?
Dr. Fauci: (43:26)
The answer is it is conceivable that we will be able to do that. I think there will always have to be attention to making sure that we don’t do all that packing in together. I think we’ll be able to have sports events in that phase where you actually have participants there. I’m not sure you’re going to be able to do that uniformly and evenly temporally with everyone. But when people get to that phase, paying attention to the fact that if there is a rebound of any sort, that when you’re in that phase, you can respond to that or you put it back and go in the other way. So, the flexibility is that there may be some setbacks. Let’s face it, this is uncharted water. There may be some setbacks that we may have to pull back a little and then go forward. But John, the direct answer to your question, I do see us getting more towards normal.
Speaker 6: (44:21)
Mr president? Mr president, if you take a look at the grading criteria, is that [inaudible 00:44:26] in these guidelines, there are at least a handful of states. I just looked at the trend lines. Idaho, Wyoming, Hawaii, Montana. They look like they’ve already satisfied that gating criteria. In your call with the governors this afternoon, did you hear back from any states who said we’re already there? We can start the process now.
Donald Trump: (44:42)
I did. I heard from a number of governors that said they’re in very good shape. I also heard not only from the call but I heard from some of the governor’s previous and I think you’ll have some very good things to report over the next few days about states opening up. And I think John, having to do with your call on sports, depending on the area, depending on where we’re talking about, you’re going to have large areas of our country where this has not been or has been totally eradicated, you’ll be able to have those filled arenas. Now, with everything being said, a lot of great work has been done on vaccines, but you have a testing process, therapeutics likewise. We have a lot of great things happening therapeutically that will be a step further. But in terms of sports, they’ll probably start off…
Donald Trump: (45:29)
As you know, I spoke to the commissioners yesterday almost I guess of every sport, and many of them are going to be starting without the fans. So, it will be made for television, the good old days made for television, and it’ll go that way. And then, fans will start coming in, maybe they’ll be separated by two seats and then ultimately we want to have packed arenas when the virus is gone. We’re going to have packed arenas and we’re going to be back to enjoying sports the way they’re supposed to be. And the same thing can be said for restaurants. So, at a certain point in time when the virus is gone, we’re going to be back to normal.
Donald Trump: (46:07)
Please, go ahead.
Speaker 7: (46:08)
Mr president and the doctors, can you clarify then, is the 30 day period to stop the spread, are those mitigation efforts still in place or have they been replaced by this new guidance?
Donald Trump: (46:19)
Well, they’re going to be in place to a large extent, and it also depends on the governor’s what they want to do. You have very different states. If you look at Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, that’s a lot different than New York. It’s a lot different than New Jersey, so it’s going to be very dependent on the governor. As you see in the charts, we’re recommending certain things. There’ll be in place dependent on what the governor wants to do. If we see something wrong, we will be expressing ourselves very strongly.
Speaker 8: (46:49)
Thank you, Mr president, does this mean that states such as Montana or Utah that already made that gating period, will they be able to go to phase one as early as saying tomorrow if the governor decides?
Donald Trump: (46:59)
You’re talking about those states that are in great shape already?
Speaker 8: (47:01)
Yes.
Donald Trump: (47:02)
They will be able to go literally tomorrow, yes. Because they’ve met all of the guidelines, if you go back. You’re going back 14 days, you’re going back even a month and the ones that I’m thinking about, the ones that I’ve already spoken to governors about, they’ve met those guidelines actually pretty long ago.
John: (47:22)
Mr president, what’s your message to the protestors we seeing, we saw a lot in Michigan but in other states that are saying that they are refusing to comply with the stay at home orders issued by governors and local officials? Isn’t it important for everybody to go along with this as we go through these phases?
Donald Trump: (47:40)
Going through it a long time, John, and it’s been a tough process for people. I told you this, there’s death and there’s problems in staying at home too. It’s not just isn’t it wonderful to stay at home? They’re suffering. This country wasn’t built on that principle, it was built on an exact opposite principle actually, and I watched in one particular state where they want to get back. There were very strict sanctions that were put on people, that was probably the most strict of all, but I just think the American people have been incredible. John, when you look at what they’ve done, when you look at what they’ve been through, when you look at all of the death and all of the problems and all of the sickness, when you look at what’s happened, I just think the American people have been incredible.
John: (48:30)
[inaudible 00:48:30] those protesters to listen to the local authorities?
Donald Trump: (48:31)
I think they’re listening. I think they’d listened to me. They seem to be protesters that like me and respect this opinion and my opinion is the same as just about all of the governors’. They all want to open. Nobody wants to stay shut, but they want to open safely. So do I, but we have large sections of the country right now that can start thinking about opening. There’ll be some mitigation and they’ll keep it going for a period of time, including masks by the way in areas that you wouldn’t even think. I asked a question today. I said, “Why would they wear masks in Wyoming or Montana or North Dakota?” And that’s if somebody should come in from an area that isn’t so successful in terms of what they’ve done. So, that will be a governor’s choice and we’ll have no problem with it.
Speaker 9: (49:18)
Mr president, you spoke this afternoon with your new congressional advisory groups, 32 bipartisan members of the House, 65 bipartisan members of the Senate. One of the big topics was the fact that the Small Business Association loan pot of $350 million has hit the cap. It’s exhausted. There’s nothing moving on the $250 billion to replenish it. What did you tell those bipartisan groups today about getting the move on to get some more money into the hands of small businesses?
Donald Trump: (49:44)
So, just for the viewers watching this or hearing you ask that question, exhausted is a good thing, not a bad thing. It went quickly. It is so popular. The banks have been incredible, including 4,000 community banks. 4,000, most people didn’t know you had that many banks. 4,000-
John: (50:00)
There’s no middle of them.
Donald Trump: (50:01)
What they want is people want to keep this going and we’re doing it to keep the small businesses open and to keep the workers paid and we have a $250 billion request. The Democrats like it, the Republicans love it and to be honest, I think something’s going to be happening. I hope so because this is a very popular program. It was really executed flawlessly. The first day, they changed an application a little bit. There was a… But when you look at what Bank of America did and what Wells Fargo did and City and a lot of the banks, but when you look at what all of the community banks did, it’s been really incredible. Well, when negotiating with Democrats and they should frankly approve it quickly. This is a great thing for our country. It’s a great thing for small business and for the workers and we’re having a hard time getting them to approve it. I think it’s going to happen. It should happen really unanimously, but they’re trying to get things and we’re not too happy with what they’re trying to get. Please, [inaudible 00:51:01] Yes, please.
Speaker 10: (51:03)
First, could you just say which states specifically you guys think have hit the gating requirements-
Donald Trump: (51:07)
I’d rather not say that, but you’ll be seeing it very soon. I’d rather have the governors be able to announce and they’re very proud of it. They’ve worked hard. Some are in an area that’s less susceptible and some really was done, I think we can say, through talent. They really worked very hard and we have some states that got too much credit for what they’ve done. Frankly, I could name you a couple of those too and I could name you a couple of them and we have others that haven’t been given credit that have done a phenomenal job.
Speaker 10: (51:37)
Part of the guidance seems to shift to states and companies the burden, not just of additional testing and surveillance, but also the new normal in which there’s smaller crowds in restaurants and bars and that’s-
Donald Trump: (51:52)
Oh, that’s going to be normal. There’s not going to be a new normal where somebody has been having for 25 years 158 seats in a restaurant, and now he’s got 30 or he’s got 60, because that wouldn’t work. That’s not normal. No, normal will be if he has the 158 or 168 seats and that’s going to happen and it’s going to happen relatively quickly we hope, but that’s our normal. Our normal is if you have 100,000 people in an Alabama football game or 110,000 to be exact, we want 110,000 people there. We want every seat occupied. Normal is not going to be where you have a game with 50,000 people.
Speaker 10: (52:30)
Sure, but to that point, best case scenario that happens in the states that are doing really well oi a month. Obviously, for I think a lot of other states that’s going to be longer than that. So, my question is what is the federal government going to do to help, especially companies, but states and local governments in those positions pay for what is now going to be an even longer standard?
Donald Trump: (52:52)
We’re going to be watching over. We’re going to see that everything is working out smoothly. We’re in very strong communication with the governors. We’re going to be helping with testing. They’re going to be doing the testing. It’s got to be a localized thing and it really has been since I’d been involved because I came in and federal government’s supposed to do testing of parking lots in the middle of a certain state that’s 2000 miles away. It’s ridiculous, but the testing has been so incredible. Two things, testing and ventilators. Ventilators are really tough. They are very complex, they’re very expensive, they’re very sophisticated machines. Some are unbelievably sophisticated. Well, we built… You saw General Motors yesterday, thousands are being issued. We have 11 companies building them. We have not had one complaint in the last week and a half, which is surge time. Don’t forget when they were calling, they were calling because in two weeks and four weeks and five weeks, they’re going to need ventilators, not because they need them right now and we were right on our counts and nobody that wanted a ventilator didn’t get a ventilator.
Donald Trump: (53:57)
Plus, we have additional if there is a surge, we hope there’s not going to be a surge at all, but we’re going to be able to build up the stockpiles of states who didn’t have them, who should have had them. And we’re also going to have a big stockpile in the federal government and we’ll be able to help foreign countries, countries that need help because look, you have countries who’ll never be able to build a ventilator. It’s tough stuff. We’re uniquely talented in the sense that we can do things that nobody else can do. We’ll get right back to you. Peter in the back?
Peter: (54:28)
Thanks. You said you didn’t want to name the states that might be ready to go. Can you give us some, or maybe the experts Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, give us some sense of how many yesterday? You said 29 States were in good shape, you think as many as 29?
Donald Trump: (54:40)
Peter, I think 29 States are in that ballgame. Not for opening, but I think there’ll be able to open relatively soon. I think the remainder are just getting better. Look, New York, New Jersey are having very tough times and they’ll be there at some point, but they’re not going to be one of the earlier states. They’re going to be later, obviously. I just spoke with the governor of New Jersey. We just spoke with Mike and a couple of folks, we had a great talk with him. Phil is a terrific guy. He’s working very hard, Democrat, but we get along. He’s working very hard. I guess the fact that he’s right next to this big massive city where everybody’s very closely together and New Jersey has been hit unbelievably hard. As hard as anybody in the true sense, but they’re doing a great job in New Jersey.
Donald Trump: (55:33)
Peter, that doesn’t mean that they’re going to be opening next week. That’s not one that’s going to be, but we have a lot of states that through location, through luck and also through a lot of talent earn a very good position and they’re getting ready to open. And over the next very short period of time, it’s going to be up to the governors. We’re going to work with them, we’re going to help them, but it’s going to be up to the governors. I think you’re going to see quite a few states starting to open, and I call it a beautiful puzzle. You have 50 pieces, all very different, but when it’s all done, it’s a mosaic. When it’s all done, it’s going to be I think a very beautiful picture, and very important is what Dr. Fauci said.
Donald Trump: (56:18)
It could be that sometime in the Fall there’ll be some flare ups. We’re going to be in a great position with everything we’ve done and everything we’ve learned. This was something that nobody ever saw before. Such contagion and very powerful. People don’t realize because we all probably have friends. I have a number of people that were just great people who were just decimated by what happened. Some are dead right now. They’re dead. They went into a hospital. One called me, he said, “I tested positive.” Four days later, he was dead. The following day after he said that, he was unconscious, so this is a tough deal. At the same time, some people got sniffles and they didn’t even realize they had a problem and they are supposedly immune. We’re going to find out about that. Even that’s a little bit soon because we don’t know how long the immunity lasts, but Peter, some states are in great shape and they’re really in great shape to open and I think you’ll have quite a few states opening soon and they’re going to be very vigilant. They’re going to be very careful. Go ahead, finish it up.
Peter: (57:23)
Sorry. What public health experts have said that this [inaudible 00:57:28] if there were comprehensive surveillance testing, which we’re obviously not in a position to do, I wonder if maybe Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci [inaudible 00:57:34] feel comfortable.
Dr. Birx: (57:38)
Dr. Fauci and I will do it together. That’s why I wanted to put up the syndromic and the influenza-like illness piece because what is key in this is the early alerts and getting in there before they even know they have a problem. And I think CDC has been remarkable in building these platforms, Dr. Redfield integrated them, so they’re all on the same website. If you look at COVID-19, you go into cases, you can find all of the data and the beauty of it is the states are used to utilizing that through flu season. So, the testing and contract tracing and Dr. Redfield will be putting people in every single state to make sure that CDC is standing beside the state and local health officials to make sure that all of those cases are immediately identified and contact traced.
Dr. Birx: (58:28)
I think what’s new and what’s really critical is this constant Sentinel surveillance for asymptomatic individuals in communities that we know are particularly vulnerable and that hasn’t been done in flu before. And I think that’s going to be the added dividend that’s really focused on who is most vulnerable and how do we get the fastest alert by generally screening people without symptoms. So, people who are just coming to the clinic will be screened for COVID-19 and we do have enough testing capacity to do both that surveillance piece as well as the diagnostic piece and contact tracing.
Peter: (59:05)
Just a follow up…
Dr. Fauci: (59:09)
People have gotten confused about that because in the beginning when we were focusing really on just mitigation and really trying to keep peaks down and trying to worry about ventilators and PPEs and things like that. When now when you get a little bit more grace period, you can start figuring out what is the penetrance of this virus in society? What are we missing in people who might be infected? What is the percentage of those people that are out there? That’s going to inform us greatly for a number of things, including the level once we prove that antibody test that you have is really protective, and we still don’t know that yet. We’re going to find that out. We may get a good feel of what the level of protection might be in society, but we don’t know that yet. So, it’s going to give us information as to what the vulnerable areas are and how we need to respond. Remember, there’s two types of-
Dr. Fauci: (01:00:03)
Vulnerable areas are and how we need to respond. Remember there’s two types of things, antibody tests and test for the diagnosis of who has the disease. One you need for contact tracing the other you want a need for finding out what’s in society. We’re going to have both of those much, much better as we go in the next weeks and months and by the time we get into the fall I think we’re going to be in pretty good shape.
Donald Trump: (01:00:26)
I just want to say if we see a hotspot possibly developing, maybe not, but if we see a hotspot developing, we’ve learned a lot, we’ll be able to suppress it, whack it. We’ll be able to do things that people weren’t even thinking about because nobody’s ever gone through this. In 1917 they went through something that was similar, probably not as contagious, probably more powerful in certain other ways, but we are going to be able to suppress it we think and we’re going to watch it very closely. We’re going to be able to watch things very closely. Please. Bob please.
Bob: (01:01:03)
Thank you, Mr president. I think what’s really important is during this bringing people back to work and our economy back to work and what’s going to go back is that we’re going to be very aggressively focused on early case recognition, isolation and contact tracing. In the event that we just went through, unfortunately in as we started, we were very capable of doing that when the initial cases all came from China all the way through January, all the way through to the end of February, we were able to identify cases early. The first 14 do the contacts, do the contact tracing over 800 contacts. We identified that two of those contacts were actually infected. We were able to isolate them. We were able to contain the outbreak. We’re about to enter a new phase of this where we’re going back to containment and mitigation is going to continue as Dr. Birx and others have said.
Bob: (01:02:01)
Some of the things that we’ve learned to do, we’re going to continue, but the major thrust of how we’re going to control and make sure that we continue to keep this nation open is early case recognition, isolation and contact tracing and that’s the fundamentals of public health. That’s what we’re going to do. You see, we have very good surveillance systems that are going to help us as we see these cases sporadically across the country. We’ve got to jump on them with early diagnosis, isolation and contact tracing. That’s what CDC is going to continue to help build that capacity in the states across this nation.
Donald Trump: (01:02:39)
And one other thing because we discussed this today with the senators, we had the senators, we had the congressmen and women. There’ll be some areas of our country wide open plains wide open spaces with not that many people relatively speaking where you’re not going to have to do that. Senators were saying there is no reason to do that in certain states, in certain areas where you have the wide open. In other cases we will be doing that, so we’ll be following it largely that also will be a function of governors. They know their states so larger that’s going to be a function of governors. Yes.
Speaker 11: (01:03:12)
Yeah. You mentioned that I think you used the term clear scientific benchmarks on testing and the main periscope that I think you guys are talking about is the IOL syndromic as well as the surveillance in the Sentinel testing. I just want to be clear, are you opening things up without doing widespread testing? Is that because you don’t have the capacity or you don’t think it’s necessary?
Donald Trump: (01:03:33)
We do have the capacity, but you know you have states without any problem. You have states with few cases and those few cases have healed. You have states with very little death, relatively speaking. As I said, one is too many but you have states with very little and frankly they’re at a point where they have almost nothing. So this is a much different case than in New York or New Jersey where they’re going through frankly, they go through hell. And if you look at New York, I’m looking at bed count because you have to look at bed count and it’s really dropped. We built the Javits center with 2,900 beds and I mean they built it in four days. They did an incredible job the army Corps of engineers, it was not used very much. We sent the ship, the hospital ship in to New York Harbor and it was not used and we went COVID and it still was not used very much because the bed count has gone way down, way, way down.
Speaker 11: (01:04:26)
When do you see yourself getting back to campaigning?
Donald Trump: (01:04:31)
This is not campaigning. I want to make the country better I don’t care about campaigning. This is about making our country better. I think this team has been incredible, whether it’s army Corps of engineers, whether it’s Fema. One thing that happened on the call today that I noticed more than anything is Pete Gainer. So many governors that I want to thank you Pete Gainer called up they had tornadoes in a big part of our country this weekend, this week. And they were all saying that he has been unbelievable. They called one after another. They were thanking us for that’s Fema and they were thanking us. No, I want to heal this country. This is a war we’ve been through a war, we have an invisible as opposed to a visible enemy. I think in many ways the invisible enemy is much more dangerous it’s much tougher.
Donald Trump: (01:05:21)
In the G7 today I went through country after country. We were there we all get along great Angela Merkel and Shinzo Abe, prime minister of Japan and all of them and their countries have been devastated by this. Their economies have been devastated by this. 184 countries all over the world and we went through one after another and I was angry because it should’ve been told to us. It should have been told to us early. It should have been told to us a lot sooner. People knew it was happening and people didn’t want to talk about it. I don’t know why, but we’re going to get to the bottom of it, but people should have-
Speaker 11: (01:06:00)
Are you referring to China or?
Donald Trump: (01:06:01)
I’m not saying anything. I’m saying people should have told us about this. They should have told the rest of the world too. When I looked at Germany talking today, when I looked at France talking today, the European union was there represented that represents a lot of countries. Their economies have been devastated, but they’re going to build them back. But we’re going to build this economy back bigger, better, stronger than ever before. You watch and we have stimulus and we’re going to do things, whether it’s infrastructure, which we would like to be able to do. Our roads, our tunnels, our highways, our bridges, our bridges need help. A lot of you have reported on our bridges. A lot of bridges are in bad shape they should have been fixed 25 years ago and they’re still standing. They have to be fixed, so hopefully we’ll get an infrastructure bill. The good news is the interest rate is close to zero and a zero interest is a good thing when it comes to rebuilding your infrastructure and your country back. Please in the back.
Speaker 12: (01:07:01)
Mr president, walk us through the calendar if you would when it comes to Memorial day or even Pentecost in May, you’ve got to July 4th, labor day weekend. What would you anticipate in each of those milestones?
Donald Trump: (01:07:14)
I don’t like to anticipate because you have a couple of states that are in difficulty that have made a lot of progress by the way, and they’re either here or they’re heading down. So I’m not going to go in terms of dates, but I think we’re going very quickly now I really believe. I think we’re going to have a lot of states open relatively soon. We’re beating the date, I set a date of May 1st and here we are and I think you’re going to have some nice surprises over the next few days and that’ll be before and that’s big stuff.
Donald Trump: (01:07:46)
Some of those states they’re big stuff, very important states and it’s going to be added on and on. Look, I don’t want anyone coming back that isn’t in position to come back. The last thing we want is for let’s say New York to come back too soon or New Jersey to come back too soon. We want them to come back when they’re ready, but they’re really heading in a good direction and I think it’ll be much faster than people think. I think it’ll be quicker, but it’s got to be safe. Yeah, please in the back
Speaker 13: (01:08:17)
Thank you. Has the government modeled the possibility of what might happen, how many deaths might occur if there is a widespread resurgence? If this just doesn’t work I mean, how many deaths are we talking about?
Donald Trump: (01:08:27)
So if we didn’t do what we did we were talking about up to 2.2 million deaths. So that’s five times almost what we lost in the civil war. Okay?
Speaker 13: (01:08:39)
Right but what about from here on out?
Donald Trump: (01:08:40)
If everything happens properly and if we continue to go the way we’re going now, we will be significantly less than the lowest number with mitigation. So it would be significantly less. And it’s still a lot of people, one is too many as I’ve said, one is too many. But we’ll be under the number of 100,000 which was the minimum number projected by the model. And I gave everybody up here, I gave all of the people that we’ve been working, I mean this was a military operation with a lot of private help. If you look at Roche, they were incredible. Look at Johnson and Johnson now what they’re doing, they are very far advanced on a vaccine. I think therapeutically we have some of these genius companies they are truly genius companies. I’m seeing them, I’m meeting with the people that run the companies and scientists and I mean what they’re doing is incredible, it’s incredible. It’s a beautiful thing to see. So I think we’re very far advanced and I think we’re going to be in great shape soon. Yeah please.
Speaker 14: (01:09:44)
Mr president I know you don’t want to mention specific states but what about Washington and California? Do you have guidance for-
Donald Trump: (01:09:51)
Do you mean Washington state or Washington here?
Speaker 14: (01:09:54)
Washington State and California too.
Donald Trump: (01:09:56)
Well that’s going to be up to them. They’re going to have to make that determination. I mean the governor of Washington was saying that he can’t find cotton because swab is a very easy thing to get and swab essentially it’s a little bit more sophisticated than a QTIP. And you got to be able to go out and find. The federal government shouldn’t be forced to go and do everything. What we’ve done is incredible, what we’ve done are the ones that can’t be done.
Donald Trump: (01:10:22)
Like for instance, the ventilators that can’t be done by anybody but a very powerful, very great manufacturing country, which is what we are and what we’re really getting to be. And I have to tell you, some of these companies, the job they’ve done and we’re going to recognize them pretty soon. The job they’ve done in terms of getting out in particular ventilators because ventilators are so hard. I say and some people say, “Oh, it’s not really as complicated.” Well it’s like building a car and you know what, the price is the same too. It’s a very expensive thing for a sophisticated ventilator. It’s very, very tough stuff. Yeah please.
Speaker 15: (01:11:00)
Mr president, let me toss this question up to you and to the doctors as well. Truthfully, for those states that aren’t ready to go to phase one to get through these phases, do we have an idea of how many millions, tens of millions of tests they’re going to need for them to get through these phases? Any number out there? Of tests of any sort?
Dr. Birx: (01:11:26)
Yeah, so I mean you’ve heard me talk about tests for a while from the podium and I think what has happened over the last several weeks is hospitals and clinics that could move to the more point of care test move to those point of care test. And what its left is an amazing array of capacity that exists in the country for at least a million more tests per week. So we have a whole team working lab by lab to see what it would take to turn on all of those labs that aren’t running the pieces of equipment now. So you see in the system, I just said to you there’s a million more tests per week that we have tests sitting there and equipment sitting there and now we have to really deal with each single lab to really figure out what they need. And I just want to thank administrative Seema Verma who went through with us and thanks to the lab directors, they really explained to us highly technical difficulty to run some of these big pieces of equipment.
Dr. Birx: (01:12:29)
Because you have to alloy clot the samples, you have to centrifuge, you have to put them on the machine, takes a tech full time. At $50 a test it wasn’t enough to hire another technician to run the machine full time. So at $100 a test it is. So those are the kinds of changes we have to make bit by bit by bit. But that alone doubles our testing capacity per week. So we’re committed to work with laboratories to answer every one of their issues with the state and local governments. And I think frankly every conversation I have and the governors will say I need 5,000 people tested. And I say, well at the university of X there are 6,700 tests waiting for you. So it’s more of making sure that every governor and every public health official knows exactly where every lab is and where the test are so we can create with them a real understanding. So all these tests can be run. So yes there is twice the capacity right now.
Donald Trump: (01:13:32)
Just so you understand, excuse me. Just so you understand we have tremendous testing capacity. You look at the labs, they’re actually saying send us. And the reason its gone down is because we have so many other tests that frankly are easier because you don’t have to send they are onsite. And now we have the new saliva test that just came out yesterday, which is probably the easiest of them all when you get right down to it. And I was seeing where Rutgers is involved, great school, great college, great university and they’re using that. So many people are going to want to use that, but they don’t have to use the labs anymore. Labs are great, highly accurate, very, very great companies, but they’re down. As that goes down, you have additional capacity. We have tremendous testing capacity and to think that a month and a half ago we had virtually nothing. I just want to conclude we are opening up our great country again, it’s going to be over a period of time.
Donald Trump: (01:14:33)
We’re working with some really great people, people that have become friends of mine and I’m including Democrat governors that have really done a good job. Republican governors, most of whom I’ve known that have done a really good job. They’re all working together. We’re offered with few exceptions the relationship has been outstanding and I want to thank doctor, doctor and Mike. I want to thank the director, fantastic job. By the way, head of the FDA he has broken hurdles that years ago even recently would have taken years. He got one thing done in one day that would have taken two years for somebody else. So I want to thank Dr. Han of the FDA. We have incredible people that we’re working with and we’re going to bring our country back and it’s going to be bigger and better and stronger than ever before. We have learned a lot. We’ve learned a lot about ourselves. I want to thank everybody and most importantly, I want to thank the American people. Thank you all very much.
Speaker 16: (01:15:35)
Mr vice president Kroger grocery stores asked your personnel to be classified as secondary first responders or emergency personnel so they can get access to testing. Is that something that [inaudible 01:15:57] would be open to?"
"Apr 14, 2020",5:12 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:03)
Very importantly, I’d like to begin by saying that we’ve just reached an agreement, the Secretary of Treasury, Steve Mnuchin, with the major airlines, all of our great airlines, to participate in a payroll support program. This agreement will fully support airline industry workers, preserve the vital role airlines play in our economy and protect taxpayers. Our airlines are now in good shape. And they will get over a very tough period of time that was not caused by them. The United States is continuing to make substantial progress in our war against the virus. We grieve at every precious life that has been lost to the invisible enemy, but through the darkness we can see the rays of light. We see that tunnel, and at the end of that tunnel, we see light. We’re starting to see it more than ever before. We’ve held our rate, the numbers, everything we’ve done. We’ve been very, very strong on it and very powerful on it.
Donald Trump: (01:16)
You look at what’s happening in other countries, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, we’re working with them. We’re trying to help them, especially with ventilators. They’ve been calling a lot. They need ventilators so badly. 15% of counties within the United States have zero cases, and many counties within the United States have a very small number of cases. Large sections of our country are really looking at other sections and saying, “Wow, that looks bad.” But they don’t have the problem. I salute the American people for following our guidelines on social distancing, even you people are so different looking out there, when I look at you. Their devotion, your devotion is saving lives. Today, I’m instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus. Everybody knows what’s going on there.
Donald Trump: (02:24)
American taxpayers provide between 400 million and $500 million per year to the WHO. In contrast, China contributes roughly $40 million a year. And even less as the organization’s leading sponsor, the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability, one of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations. They were very much opposed to what we did. Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China, saving untold numbers of lives. Thousands and thousands of people would have died. Had other nations likewise suspended travel from China, countless more lives would have been saved. Instead, look at the rest of the world. Look at parts of Europe. Other nations and regions who followed WHO guidelines and kept their borders open to China, accelerated the pandemic all around the world. Many countries said, “We’re going to listen to the WHO.” And they have problems the likes of which they cannot believe.
Donald Trump: (03:43)
Nobody can believe. The decision of other major countries to keep travel open was one of the great tragedies and missed opportunities from the early days. The WHO’s attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above lifesaving measures. Travel bands work for the same reason that quarantines work. Pandemics depend on human-to-human transmission. Border control is fundamental to virus control. Since its establishment in 1948, the American people have generously supported the World Health Organization to provide better health outcomes for the world, and most importantly to help prevent global health crises. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have deep concerns whether America’s generosity has been put to the best use possible. The reality is that the WHO fail to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion. The world depends on the WHO to work with countries to ensure that accurate information about international health threats is shared in a timely manner, and if it’s not to independently tell the world the truth about what is happening.
Donald Trump: (05:08)
The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable. It’s time after all of these decades. The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan, that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts. There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December, 2019, which should have speared the WHO to investigate and investigate immediately. Through the middle of January, it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human-to-human transmission happening despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary.
Donald Trump: (05:53)
The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency cost valuable time, tremendous amounts of time. More time was lost in the delay it took to get a team of international experts into examine the outbreak, which we wanted to do, which they should have done. The inability of the WHO to obtain virus samples to this date has deprived the scientific community of essential data. New data that emerges across the world on a daily basis, points to the unreliability of the initial reports. And the world received all sorts of false information about transmission and mortality.
Donald Trump: (06:47)
The silence of the WHO on the disappearance of scientific researchers and doctors, and our new restrictions on the sharing of research into the origins of COVID- 19, and the country of origin, is deeply concerning. Especially when we put up by far the largest amount of money. Not even close. Had the WHO done its job to get medical experts into China to objectively assess the situation on the ground and to call out China’s lack of transparency, the outbreak could have been contained at its source with very little death, very little death, and certainly very little death by comparison. This would have saved thousands of lives and avoided worldwide economic damage. Instead, the WHO willingly took China’s assurances to face value and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the Chinese government, even praising China for its so-called transparency.
Donald Trump: (07:55)
I don’t think so. The WHO pushed China’s misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bands. They told us when we put on our travel ban, a very strong travel ban, there was no need to do it. Don’t do it. They actually fought us. The WHO’s reliance on China’s disclosures likely caused a 20 fold increase in cases worldwide, and it may be much more than that. The WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided a serious explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes, of which there were many. America and the world have chosen to rely on the WHO for accurate, timely, and independent information to make important public health recommendations and decisions. If we cannot trust that this is what we will receive from the WHO, our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals. We’ll have no choice but to do that.
Donald Trump: (09:06)
Our countries are now experiencing, you look all over the world, tremendous death and economic devastation, because those tasked with protecting us by being truthful and transparent failed to do so. It would have been so easy to be truthful. And so much death has been caused by their mistakes. We will continue to engage with the WHO to see if it can make meaningful reforms. For the time being, we will redirect global health and directly work with others. All of the aid that we send will be discussed at very, very powerful letters and with very powerful and influential groups and smart groups, medically, politically and every other way. And we’ll be discussing it with other countries and global health partners. What we do with all of that money that goes to WHO, and maybe WHO will reform, and maybe they won’t, but we’ll be able to see.
Donald Trump: (10:20)
As you know, in other countries, hit hard by the virus, hospitals have been tragically forced to ration medical care and the use of ventilators, but due to our early and aggressive action, the skill of our healthcare workers, and the resilience of our healthcare system, no hospital in America has been forced to deny any patient access to a ventilator. With all of the talk you’ve heard, where some states wanted 40,000 ventilators. I said, “That doesn’t work. 40,000.” And they ended up with seven or 8,000. And they had no problem. 40,000 ventilators for one state. It was ridiculous. The scariest day of my life was about a month ago when after a long day of meetings, my team told me that we were going to be needing 130,000 ventilators.
Donald Trump: (11:23)
That we were short hundreds of thousands of ventilators. This is the system we inherited. I had governors requesting unreasonable sums that the federal government just didn’t have. And you look at the states, the states didn’t have, the states were not prepared. I knew that every person who needed a ventilator and didn’t get one would die. And that’s what we were told. They would die. I saw another country’s doctors having to make decisions on who got a ventilator and who didn’t. And I knew that this would be a defining challenge of the crisis. Those that didn’t get ventilators were said to be in a position, only of one alternative, and that was death.
Donald Trump: (12:17)
Would we be able to prevent Americans from dying because we couldn’t get them ventilators, and the ventilators that they needed and they needed immediately. I instructed my team to move heaven and earth to make sure that this didn’t happen. We started to smartly ration and distribute the ventilators that we had and that others had. And I got daily updates on the supply we had, from requests coming in and people wanting to have updates. We had a great group of people working on it. I instructed my team to use the Defense Protection Act.
Donald Trump: (12:58)
And the Defense Production Act was used very powerfully, more powerfully than anybody would know. In fact, so powerfully that for the most part, we didn’t have to officially take it out. It was a hammer. It was a very powerful hammer, in order to manufacture as many ventilators as possible. Last year, America manufactured from a dead start, 30,000 ventilators. And this year the number will be over 150,000 ventilators. It could be as high as 200,000. Far more than we’ll ever need. So we’ll be able to stockpile, we’ll be able to talk to states about stockpiling. These are high quality ventilators. We had a choice. We could do inexpensive, less productive ventilators or high quality. We’ve done a high quality ventilator, so we should have anywhere from 150 to 200,000 ventilators.
Donald Trump: (13:58)
In addition to that, we have 10, 000 ventilators right now in the federal stockpile ready to move, should we need them. We might not. Should we need them in New York, or New Jersey, or in Louisiana, or in Illinois, or any other state that may need them, if we have a surge. I’d like to ask Adam Bowler to come up and just say a few words. He’s done a fantastic job. A young man who worked 24 hours a day on handling this situation. And I’d just like to have Adam, wherever he may be, come up and say a few words. Adam, please. Thank you very much.
Adam Boehler: (14:41)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. At your direction, this country has worked hard over the past few weeks to ramp up ventilator production through all means possible. Thousands of ventilators are coming in now monthly, with over 100,000 by the end of June. At the same time, there are over 60,000 ventilators in our hospitals right now that are not in use. Knowing this and at your direction, we reached out to the American Hospital Association to design a system that allows hospitals to lend ventilators to other hospitals right when they need it. Within the past week alone, 20 top health systems have signed up for this dynamic ventilator reserve representing over 4,000 ventilators. Not only do we have top academic systems, like Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic, but we also have top health systems from New York City, New Orleans, Washington State, and California. Over a week ago, these places would have needed help, but now they are here to help.
Adam Boehler: (15:47)
There’s been no American that has needed a ventilator that has not received one. This dynamic virtual reserve, combined with our strategic stockpile, will ensure that this is always the case. I’d like to thank the president for his leadership and directive to focus on public private partnerships like this one. I’d also like to thank Sam Hazen from HCA, Lloyd Dean from Common Spirit, for leading this effort with the AHA and the Federation of American Hospitals. These have been difficult times. A few weeks ago, the Vice President came into my office and he reminded us of the power of the resilience of the American people and of private companies. We needed it that day, Mr. Vice President. This partnership is another example of Americans helping Americans. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (16:41)
Thank you very much. Fantastic.
Adam Boehler: (16:43)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (16:45)
I’d shake his hand, but I’m not allowed to. Times have changed, haven’t they? Thank you very much. You did a fantastic job. We’re very proud of you and your whole team. Thank you. Today, we are taking further action to maximize our oversupply and available-
Donald Trump: (17:03)
… to maximize our oversupply in available ventilators. This afternoon I met with the leaders, the top people of many of America’s big, powerful, beautiful and very, very important hospitals and hospital associations who join us today. We had a great meeting, learned a lot, and they’ve been going through a lot. They’ve been doing a fantastic job as everybody here will attest. I’m pleased to announce that my administration is partnering with the hospitals across the country to create an innovative new system called the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve so that we’re going to have tremendous numbers of ventilators that we’re able to help our states with at a later date. If there’s ever a problem like this, which we hope to God will never happen again. It was 1917, 1918, that’s a long time ago. We hope it never happens again. And I’d like to ask Rick Pollock, CEO of American Hospital Association, Sam Hazen, CEO of HCA Healthcare, it’s the largest in the United States, Warner Thomas, CEO of Oschner Health, and if I could, Ami Hall. Are you here from Cleveland Clinic? Somebody? Good, thank you. Come on up, [Faulx 00:00:18:25], please. Thank you. Say a few words.
Ami Hall: (18:32)
Thank you very much Mr. President. We appreciate the opportunity to work with you and your team on the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve Program. This will provide a really important mechanism for us in serving our patients and communities by ensuring that this vital equipment will be available to critical areas that are in need. As this battle against this disease has affected the country a little bit unevenly, the rates of infection, hospitalization and ICU use varies from one region to another. In some places with lower infection rates some ventilators may not be in use while other areas are potentially stretched beyond their capacity. The database of available ventilators that we are creating will allow us to flex so that we can make sure that available equipment can be shared with those in need.
Ami Hall: (19:28)
We appreciate the leadership of the health systems that are here today that has stepped forward and Adam mentioned a few, I don’t know if he caught Dr. Fritz Francoise from NYU Langone and David Dill, the CEO of LifePoint as well. We appreciate the work of the administration in helping us find innovative solutions to ensure the best care for our patients. We’ll continue to work with hospitals and health systems across the country to add to this reserve further. Your team has provided us with important leadership and we look forward to working with you in making this a success. Thank you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (20:04)
Thank you very much.
Speaker 3: (20:08)
Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Adam, the team. I stand here before you in front of our 285,000 colleagues who provide care to patients every day across the country. One of the guiding principles we had when we went into this COVID-19 battle was to find partnerships, partnerships with other components of the industry, partnerships with other health systems, but partnerships with governments, both local and federal and we’re proud to be a part of this private-public sector partnership and I think it’s going to do great good for the community. So thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (20:42)
Great job. Thank you [inaudible 00:20:43].
Oschner Health Representative: (20:48)
Thank you Mr. President. It’s great to have Oschner Health be part of this program. We certainly have been a recipient and the State of Louisiana has been a recipient of help getting ventilators to our state and to Ochsner Health. We’re currently taking care of about 60% of the Covid patients in New Orleans and we did see a spike over the past few weeks, but we’re starting to get on the other side of that and heading in the right direction. I also want to thank you personally for helping Ochsner Health. A couple of weeks ago we were running short on surgical gowns and you and your team were able to direct some to New Orleans, which was helpful to us and other hospitals around the New Orleans area. So we’re excited to be part of this Dynamic Ventilator Reserve and we are proud to be a part of that and help other communities around the country. Thank you.
Cleveland Clinic Representative: (21:38)
Thank you Mr. President for the invitation here. On behalf of the Cleveland Clinic, I would just like to offer a slightly different story about a Covid pandemic. In our home state of Ohio, we did an early institution of a social distancing. Our ability to scale up the testing and ramping out the capacity, we have actually seen a stable number of patients over the last 8 to 10 days. Only 160 patients have been hospitalized with Covid infection in Cleveland Clinic Health System. We are also very grateful for the support from our state government as well from our federal government. This is a battle where we’re all in together. We coordinate our efforts, share our resources and work together as one. I’m firmly convinced that we can do a lot of good when we work together. Thank you very much for having us. Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (22:36)
Thank you all. Great job.
Donald Trump: (22:36)
That was a terrific meeting and thank you all for being here. Thank you very much. The United States has far more ICU beds per capita than any other nation. We have 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 people, which is the best there is compared with roughly 12.5 beds per 100,000 in Italy, 11.6 beds in France, 9.7 beds in Spain. Think of that, 34.7 we have and 6.6 in the UK. There are more than 60,000 ventilators at hospitals and other healthcare facilities that are not in use at this moment. They didn’t need them. We got a lot of them out and they didn’t need them and that’s a good thing that they didn’t need them, but a lot of good brain power was involved in making a lot of fantastic decisions. I want to thank our vice president for the task force and I want to thank all members of your task force on having done an incredible job. You really have done an incredible job. Thank you Mike very much.
Donald Trump: (23:41)
Through this new partnership with the hospitals, where they have unused ventilators they will voluntary lend those ventilators to other hospitals and other areas of greater need. Within the last several days, more than 20 of our nation’s largest health systems have already pledged more than 4,000 ventilators should we need them, and I have been told that if they need more, there are more there. We’re going to be helping very soon when the supply really starts pouring in, which started but will really start in about less than a month. We’re going to be helping other countries and they need it very badly. They have no chance without these ventilators. They have to have ventilators.
Donald Trump: (24:35)
As we continue our medical war against the virus, the FDA has now authorized the first test developed by researchers from Rutgers University that can use saliva from patients. The first one. These tests can be self administered by patients in healthcare settings, which will reduce exposure for medical workers and save personal protective equipment. Rutgers will begin processing 10,000 tests daily. So by using saliva, that’s a first, they’ll be able to do things in terms of speed and ease that we haven’t been able to do before. So a lot of great innovation is taking place during this period of time and that’s innovation, I call it innovation under pressure. There’s a big difference. Innovation under pressure, right? Cleveland Clinic knows all about that.
Donald Trump: (25:28)
As we prepare for the next phase of this great struggle, we must also do everything in our power to restore prosperity for the American worker. There’s tremendous interest and excitement surrounding the administration’s efforts to get the economy roaring once again, and I think it’s going to roar once it gets open. I think it’s going to go up tremendously. You see what’s happening with the stock market already because a lot of the very smart financial people, the great minds, they’re looking at the stock and they’re saying, “Wow,” because what they’re really seeing is how we’re doing. If we weren’t doing well, the market wouldn’t be at a level that it is today. They have a lot of confidence that we’re doing the right thing and that our country’s going to be open soon and our country’s going to be booming.
Donald Trump: (26:18)
We’ve had requests to participate from the best in the world as we share their enthusiasm to get our country going. So I thank them for wanting to contribute and we look forward to speaking with many industry leaders seeking their input on how we can return to what was until very recently the greatest economy anywhere in the world. And I can say the greatest economy in the history of the world, there’s never been an economy like we had just a little bit more than a month ago. We set every record you could set. More people working than we’ve ever had working before, almost 160 million. The best unemployment numbers we’ve ever had and the best employment numbers we’ve ever had. Everybody was doing well. Stock market at a record, 142 days it hit a record and I think we’re going to top those records. Okay? And I think we’re going to top them soon once we get rid of the invisible enemy, which will happen.
Donald Trump: (27:20)
The plans to reopen the country are close to being finalized and we will soon be sharing details and new guidelines with everybody. I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly and I will then be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state at a time and in a manner as most appropriate. The day will be very close because certain states, as you know, are in much different condition and in a much different place than other states. It’s going to be very, very close, maybe even before the date of May 1st. So that will be for some states. Actually, there are over 20 that are in extremely good shape and we think we’re going to be able to get them open fairly quickly and then others will follow.
Donald Trump: (28:36)
The federal government will be watching them very closely and we’ll be there to help. We’ll be there to help in many different ways as we’ve been where we built hospital beds at a number that nobody’s ever seen before, where we did the ventilators that we just discussed at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. Nobody can even believe, other foreign countries, even powerful countries can’t believe what we were able to do with ventilators. Big powerful countries, big producing countries can’t believe what we were able to do. We will hold the governors accountable. But again, we’re going to be working with them to make sure it works really well.
Donald Trump: (29:18)
Now, we have a list of people that I’ll be speaking to over the next very short period of time and in many cases tomorrow. We’re going to have elected officials and we’ll be submitting that list to you within the next 24 hours. But we have a list of different industries that I’ll be discussing by meeting by telephone because we don’t want people traveling right now. The American Farm Bureau Federation, Zippy Duvall; Cisco Systems; Tyson Foods; Purdue Farms; Cargill; Archer Daniels, Midland Company; Corteva; Tractor Supply Company; Seaboard Corporation; Grimmway Farms; Mountaire Farms and others in the agricultural business. In banking it’s Bank of America. Brian Moynihan has been great. JP Morgan Chase, Jamie Diamond; Goldman Sachs; Citi Group; Wells Fargo; US Bank Corp; Morgan Stanley, James Gorman, Grand Rapids State Bank; Southern Bank Corp, all great institutions with lots to say and lots of good ideas.
Donald Trump: (30:37)
And if you look at how Paycheck has been working out, the numbers are incredible and I hope Congress is going to be able to supplement the amount of money going to our workers. I hope they are able to get that done very quickly because it’s been an incredible success and many are already spending that money and the money’s been distributed at numbers that nobody believed possible for this short period of time. It was only a week ago, but a lot of money has been distributed already. It’s going to keep our small businesses open.
Donald Trump: (31:09)
The Construction Labor Workforce; International Union of Operating Engineers, Jim Callahan; North America Building Trades Union, Sean McGarvey. These are a lot of friends of mine. Labor’s International Union of North America, Terry O’Sullivan; International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James Hoffa; National Electrical Contractors Association, David Long; Bechtel Floor, National Association of Home Builders; Association of Builders and Contractors; Associated General Contractors; Richard Trumka, AFL-DIO, GH Palmer. So these are some of the unions, pretty much almost all of the ones that will be on the line.
Donald Trump: (31:59)
In defense we have Lockheed Martin, Honeywell, Northrop Grumman. These are all the top of each company, CEOs, chairmans, presidents. Raytheon, General Dynamics. Energy, we had a tremendous success recently with energy over the weekend. It finished with a tremendous credit going to Russia and to Saudi Arabia, and it could be as much as 20 million barrels a day a cut so that we can get rid of some of the tremendous excess oil that’s been produced because of the fact that the virus just knocked out almost 50% of the business. It’s been an amazing achievement. Some people say one of the biggest oil deals ever made, maybe the biggest oil deal ever made they’re saying. I didn’t know that, but we were involved in getting that done and it was very important. We’re going to save hundreds of thousands of jobs for our energy industry, Texas and North Dakota, Oklahoma, all of our different energy states. It’s great. So we’re very happy about it. I want to thank everybody. We had the, it’s called OPEC Plus. That’s OPEC Plus, meaning some nations outside of OPEC. And I also want to thank the president of Mexico because he was terrific. He showed great dexterity and flexibility in getting the deal done. We want to thank him very much.
Donald Trump: (33:24)
On the energy front, we had ExxonMobil, Continental Resources, Chevron, Southern Company, Alabama Power, Conoco Phillips, Occidental Petroleum, Kinder Morgan, Pess Corporation, Perot Group, and a few others, big ones, great ones. Financial services we have Blackstone, Stephen Schwarzman; Paulson and Company, John Paulson; Citadel, Ken Griffin; Elliot Management, Paul Singer; Vista Equity Partners, Robert Smith; Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson; Mas-
Donald Trump: (34:03)
Fidelity investments, Abigail Johnson, MasterCard, Visa, Chubb, Sequoia, Stephens; Warren Stephens, great. Charles Schwab, Chuck Schwab will be here by phone. Food and Beverage National Restaurant Association, McDonald’s, Darden Restaurants, Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola, Chick Fil A, Subway, Bloomin’ Brands, Yum brands, Papa John’s, Wendy’s, waffle house. Starbucks, Wolfgang Pub, Thomas Keller, John George, my friend John George and Danielle, you know them. From the transportation world, FedEx, Fred Smith, the legend. United Airlines, Oscar Beunos, UPS, David Abney, JB Hunt, YRC Worldwide, Crowley, Maritime, Credible, big powerful shippers in transportation companies. In telecommunications we have the legendary John Malone of Liberty Media, Verizon, T-Mobile, Charter Communications, and Brian Roberts of Comcast. Thank you all very much. Healthcare, New York Presbyterian, Jerry Spire, friend of mine, HCA Healthcare. Sam Hazen. Thank you, Sam. Just met with Sam. Ascension Health, Common Spirit Health, Community Health Systems, Trinity Health, Cardinal Health, McKesson, 3M. Thank you Mike Roman for helping us with the face masks. It worked out well for everybody. Proctor and Gamble, Abbott Laboratories, Johnson and Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Donald Trump: (36:04)
They’ve been helping us incredibly with testing. Gilead sciences, Abby Vi, Regeneron, Biogen, Roche. And Roche has been fantastic on testing. The job they’ve done, I have to call them out. They have really … They have stepped up like very few. Anthem, United Health Group, Aetna, Cigna and Humana, all the big ones. The tech companies. We have the right ones. Apple, we have Tim Cook. Google, Sundar. Thank you, Sundar. Oracle, Larry Ellison and Safra Catz. Salesforce, Mark Benenoff. SAP, SAP. Jen Morgan, Microsoft’s Satya. Great job he’s done. Thank you, Satya. Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. IBM, Intel, Qualcomm, Cisco, Advanced Micro Devices. Broadcom. Incredible companies, companies that no other country will catch if they’re smart. They have to be smart. But I’ve dealt with a lot of different countries and I will say that no … The respect for Silicon Valley and our tech companies, there’s nobody even close to our tech companies. They can’t catch them, so they try and buy them. But we’ve sort of put an end to a lot of that.
Donald Trump: (37:37)
In sports, we want to get our sports back, so importantly. These will be some separate calls. Some will be together by the wait lists and some will be separate, but we have to get our sports back. I’m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old, but I haven’t actually had too much time to watch. I would say maybe I watch one batter and then I get back to work. The NBA, Adam Silver, the Major League Baseball. We miss our base … Well, this is baseball season right here. Rob Manford. Thank you very much. NFL, Roger Goodell. Thank you, Roger. UFC, Dana White. Great Dana White. PGA, Jay Monahan. LPGA, Michael Juan. USDA, Patrick Galbraith. Major League Soccer, Don Garber. WWE, the great Vince McMahon. NASCAR, Lisa Kennedy. Thank you, Lisa. NHL, Gary Bettman. From the New England Patriots, Bob Kraft. Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones. Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban. And some of the thought leaders that we’re going to have and there are some others that we are having, we’re just waiting to hear, but everybody is saying yes I must say. John Allison, Heritage Foundation. Kay Coles James, great person. Hoover Institute. Condoleezza Rice, another great person. Art Laffer, Steve Moore, Steve Forbes, Larry Lindsey, Catherine Reynolds, Scott Gottlieb. Just spoke with Scott. Jim Dement and Jim has been terrific friend. Bill Haggerty and Ray Washburn. And religious leaders will be coming on Friday. We’ll be speaking to and we’re going to have a separate list, but we have tremendous enthusiasm to meet by our great religious leaders. We have incredible people and they want to be a part. We’ll be talking about churches and we’ll be talking about opening and we’ll be talking about things that are very important to a lot of people, including me. We’re going to find out how we’re doing in that regard. Those are the names that we have on our list. They’re the names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest. They’re going to give us some ideas, but we’re all set, as I said.
Donald Trump: (40:14)
The governors are going to be opening up their states. They’re going to declare when. They’re going to know when. Some can open very, very shortly, if not almost immediately. We’ll give a date, but the date’s going to be in the very near future, so we’ll get it open. Individual states when the governors will be held accountable. If they need things, we’ll help them get those things, but we want them to do their testing. We want them because they’re equipped to do testing. We’ve created incredible test and we’ve done more testing than anybody’s ever done in the world right now and we had a broken system and now we have a great system. We have a system where other countries are coming to us and saying, we want to get some of those tests. I want to thank Abbott because Abbott came up with the first simpler test.
Donald Trump: (41:02)
The first one was rough if you were … I think it was more of an operation than a test. The first one was, for anybody that took it, it was not easy. But now we have a very simple test with Abbott. Now we have saliva. We have lots of other things that are happening, but we have millions of tests. The governors are responsible. They have to take charge. They have to do a great job and we’re going to suggest that they check people through tests or otherwise coming into their states and they run their states very strong. Eventually we won’t have to do that. Eventually this will be gone, but for a while we’re going to do it. They’re going to take charge at their borders. They’re going to take charge of people coming in, and maybe to an extent, depending on what they work out with a nearby state, it may be also people leaving. They’ll be able to do that very shortly. We’ll be announcing a date, but it’ll be very short and frankly it’ll be at a time that will be earlier than the deadline that we imposed, the end of April.
Donald Trump: (42:09)
We think that some of the governors, we’ll be in really good shape to open up even sooner than that. We’ll speak to them, but we’re all set. We’re counting on the governors to do a great job. Others are going to have to take a longer period of time until they’re in a position to say we’re ready to go. And that’s okay. We understand that. Some of the governors have a very tough situation, but in almost all cases it’s all starting to come down. We’re very proud of the job everybody’s done. And if you look at the numbers … So the minimum, as portrayed, Deborah’s here. Dr. Birx has been fantastic. The minimum was 100,000 deaths and I hope to be substantially under the minimum.
Donald Trump: (42:55)
Meaning we all hope, Mike, right? We all hope to be substantially under. We did the right thing because otherwise it would have been … The projections are 2 million people. The actual projection was 2.2 million people and if you cut it in half, that would be 1.1 million people. That’s many more. That’s double the Civil War. And if you cut that in half, you’re talking five or 600,000 people. That’s what we lost in the Civil War. And that’s cutting it, cutting it, cutting it. And we’re not going to … That would not be acceptable. It would not be acceptable. Nothing’s … One life isn’t acceptable, but we weren’t given that option. I’m confident that these respected people that I just read from the list will give us some great ideas in addition to what the governors have learned. The governors have learned a lot. I’ve spoken to governors that at the beginning it was a contentious relationship and now it’s a very friendly relationship and a really great relationship. I’m proud to say that some of them I think are friends.
Donald Trump: (44:01)
In some cases they’re Democrats, but I think they like me and I actually like them. I’ll tell you who they are someday. But we’re all getting along and we all want to do the right thing and I think they’re going to do a great job of leading their individual states. It’ll be a beautiful thing to watch. They’ll go and rely on their mayors and their local town officials. They’ll bring it right down. And Washington shouldn’t be doing that. We can’t be thinking about a Walmart parking lot that’s 2000 miles away where we’re doing testing, but a governor of a state can and a mayor can and right down the line. I think it’s going to be a terrific system and if we’re unhappy with the state, we’re going to let them know we’re unhappy and if they’re not doing the job and they can’t get the job done. And for some reason things are happening that we’re not going to like, like the numbers are heading in a wrong direction, we’ll have to do something that’s very serious.
Donald Trump: (44:53)
We’ll have to maybe close them up and start all over again, but I don’t think we’re going to have to do that. I think the governors are going to come out at a time that … And these will be individual dates and the governors are going to come out at a time when they’re ready. Some can come out very, very shortly and we look forward to watching that process. I think it’s going to be a very beautiful process. Our discussions will focus with the people that we’re dealing with on rejuvenating the economy and always health, always health. Health and life. Living is number one, but the rejuvenated economy and I think it’s going to go quickly. We’ll be utilizing our robust testing capacity for the governors. We’ll be giving them what they need if they don’t have it themselves. We hope by now there’ll be able to have it themselves.
Donald Trump: (45:46)
We were hoping they would have had it themselves early on, but they weren’t, but such great advances have been made. We’ll be dealing with them on that and we, they can rely on us very strongly. They’re going to be relying on us I think for some help and we’re there, whether it’s building hospital beds, which I don’t think they’re going to need. You look at Javits Center, a great, great job that the Army Corps of Engineers did. FEMA got involved. We actually ended up sending our medical people. That was not a COVID 19 center and they asked, could you do that? And then even after we did that, it was not used very much. Meaning they didn’t have to use it nearly to the extent that they thought when they conceived it. It wasn’t that they made a mistake. Nobody made a mistake. We built it.
Donald Trump: (46:30)
I’d rather have too much than too little. Err on the side of caution. It’s really incredible what they did, including the two ships, the two great ships. I just want to thank a lot of really great people, a lot of great politicians. And again, we’re going to be announcing the political list tomorrow. On there we’re going to have a lot of senators and we’re going to be having a meeting with the governor’s probably on Thursday, a meeting by teleconference and a lot of things will be discussed and some of the details will be discussed. But we want them to do an incredible job of running their states. I think they’ll do an incredible job too. After having gotten to know so many of them, I think each one of them will do an incredible job.
Donald Trump: (47:17)
And again, the federal government is there. We have ventilators if they need them. We have beds if they need them. We have hospitals, if they need them. We have a testing capacity that’s now second to none, where again other countries are calling us. Countries that you thought were doing well are calling us for help on testing so we’re there to help. And with that if you have a few questions we’ll take them and if not, that would be okay too. Yeah, go ahead please. Jeff?
Jeff: (47:47)
Mr. President, two questions. First on your announcement about the WHO, I understand your grievances with them, can you address why it is the correct time to do this now in the middle of a pandemic?
Donald Trump: (47:58)
Well, we’re going to be dealing with countries and we’re going to be dealing with leaders of different parts of the world. We spend $500 million a year, we have for many years more. Far more than anybody else, including China. I mean look, I read off a long list of problems that we have and we’ve had problems with them for years. It doesn’t matter. We’re looking at a term of 60 to 90 days. We’re doing a very thorough investigation right now as we speak, but this should have been done by previous administrations a long time ago. And when you look at the mistakes that were made, all of the mistakes that were made, it’s just something we have to look at and it is very China centric.
Donald Trump: (48:39)
I told that to President Xi. I said, the World Health Organization is very China centric, meaning whatever it is, China was always right. You can’t do that. Can’t do that. Not right. And we spend, and again, it’s not a question of money, but when we’re spending $500 million and China’s spending $38 million, $34 million, $40 million, $42 million in a case, it’s again, not money, but it’s not right. So we’ll see. This is an evaluation period, but in the meantime we’re putting a hold on all funds going to World Health. We will be able to take that money and channel it to the areas that most need it and that’s another way of doing it. But we have not been treated properly.
Speaker 6: (49:27)
Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (49:27)
Yeah, please.
Speaker 6: (49:28)
You mentioned that you’re going to speaking with all the governors tomorrow, make recommendations.
Donald Trump: (49:33)
Probably Thursday.
Speaker 6: (49:34)
On Thursday. What if they don’t listen to you or take your advice or obey you? Will you consider taking away their federal funding?
Donald Trump: (49:43)
I don’t want to say that. They’ll listen. They’ll be fine. I think we’re going to have a good relationship. They need the federal government not only for funding, and I’m not saying take it away, but they need it for advice. They’ll need maybe equipment that we have. We have a tremendous stockpile that we’re in the process of completing. We’re in a very good position. Again, the cupboard was bare when I got here. Nobody ever thought a thing. In all fairness to previous administrations, nobody ever thought anything like this was going to happen, but it did happen. Now, the governor’s will be very, very respectful of the presidency. Again, this isn’t me, this is the presidency. The presidency has such a great importance in terms of what we’re doing. And you can talk about constitution, you can talk about federalism, you can talk about whatever you want, but the best way, I’m talking now from a managerial standpoint is to let individual governors run individual states and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them. Yeah, john.
John: (50:43)
Mr. President, you talked about having testing and tracing equipment and the facility for that in place to open up the government. Dr. Fauci said this morning that that critical testing and tracing ability does not currently exist.
Donald Trump: (51:03)
I don’t know. Look, I don’t know. I don’t know what he said.
John: (51:03)
My question…
Donald Trump: (51:03)
I don’t know, look, I don’t know. Hey, John, I don’t know what he said. Nobody knows.
Speaker 7: (51:03)
My question is will it exist by May 1st?
Donald Trump: (51:08)
The individual governors have testing. The individual governors… We have many forms of testing and new testing is being developed. Our country has to get opened and it will get open and it’ll get opened safely and hopefully quickly. Some areas quicker than other areas, but there is tremendous testing and the governors will use whatever testing is necessary and if they’re not satisfied with their testing, they shouldn’t open, but they’ll use whatever testing is necessary. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 8: (51:40)
Thank you, Mr. President, back to the W.H.O., will you support the organization again, if Tedros is immediately replaced or do you want to see him step down as possible-
Donald Trump: (51:51)
We’re doing an investigation. I don’t know the gentleman, but I know there’ve been problems and it’s been very unfair to the United States. Just like the World Trade Organization has been very, very unfair and now they’re coming into line. When they consider China a developing nation and because China’s a developing nation, they take massive advantage of the United States. Why did another presidents stop this? I’ve been talking about it from the day I got in and we’re looking at that very, very strongly. World trade, W, so I have problem with World Health and World Trade, both of them, I’m not sure which is worse, you want to know the truth but we’ll figure it out, okay. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 9: (52:27)
Mr. President, you were just criticizing the W.H.O. for praising China is transparent, but you were saying many of the same things about China just a couple of months ago. So I mean how do you square your decision-
Donald Trump: (52:42)
Well, I did a trade deal with China, where China is supposed to be spending $250 billion in our country. We’re going to be watching a very much to see. Now we’ve got a little bit waylaid by the virus, but look, I’d love to have a good relationship with China, but if you look and we made a phenomenal deal… China has paid, because of me, china has paid us tens of billions of dollars over the course of a very short period of time, billions of it. Some of that money has been spent to farmers where they were targeted by China. We cannot let that happen. We can’t let that happen. So we ended up signing a very good trade deal. Now I want to see if China lives up to it. I know President Xi, I think he will live up to it. If he doesn’t live up to it, that will be okay too because we have very, very good alternatives. Go ahead.
Speaker 10: (53:32)
Thank you. Today’s 600,000 cases, 25,000 deaths. I know you want to blame W.H.O, but I’ve spoken to hundreds of people across the country in the last few weeks who say they still can’t get tested and that they aren’t social distancing because-
Donald Trump: (53:46)
So the governors … [crosstalk 00:53:48] Excuse me, excuse me, your question, you’re ready. The governors are supposed to do testing. It’s up to the governors. Go ahead please. [crosstalk 00:53:59] Quiet, quiet, quiet. [crosstalk 00:53:59]
Speaker 10: (53:59)
Mr. President, if they are following your lead that they are not social distancing-
Donald Trump: (54:10)
The governors are doing the testing. It’s now not up and it hasn’t been up to the federal government. Go ahead. [crosstalk 00:54:17].
Speaker 11: (54:15)
Mr. President, I have a quick follow on the W.H.O. but if May 1-
Donald Trump: (54:19)
I told them when they put this guy here, it’s nothing but trouble. He’s a showboat. If you keep talking, I’ll leave and you can have it out with the rest of these people. If you keep talking, I’m going to leave and you can have it out with them. Just a loud mouth. Go ahead.
Speaker 11: (54:36)
If you could kind of clarify, are you basically lifting your slow the spread before the May 1 deadline?
Donald Trump: (54:43)
No, I’m not at all.
Speaker 11: (54:43)
And then how many states-
Donald Trump: (54:44)
The governors are going to be running their individual states some of them will say, no, I can’t open now and some of them may last longer than we even would think. Others will say, I can, you can go. I don’t want to mention states, but there are numerous states that are in great shape right now. They are viewing the rest of the country like, we don’t even believe this is happening. We have a lot of those states. They’re set to open practically now. I mean they would be open now. We’re going to let them open sooner than the date. We’re going to pick a date, we’re going to get a date that’s good, but it’s going to be very, very soon. Sooner than the end of the month. But there are many states out there that are looking at this and they’re reviewing it and they’re saying, we shouldn’t be even included in this. There’s some that want to open up almost now. Now if we disagree with it, we’re not going to let them open. We’re not going to let them open.
Donald Trump: (55:34)
If some governor has a lot of problems, a lot of cases, a lot of death, and they want to open early, we’re not going to let it happen. So we’re there to watch. We’re there to help. But we’re also there to be critics. And on testing, very important. We’ve always wanted the states to do the testing. We’re now providing great testing, but the state has to provide the great testing. The state has to provide the ventilators, but they didn’t do that, so we ended up going into the ventilator business essentially, and we’ve made tens of thousands of ventilators and we solved the big problem for the states. But we want them to do the testing and we are there to help. Yeah, please.
Speaker 12: (56:14)
I have two questions, I have a question on the-
Donald Trump: (56:16)
One question, just one.
Speaker 12: (56:17)
Well, I have a question on the governors, but first can I follow up on-
Donald Trump: (56:19)
One question.
Speaker 12: (56:20)
Can I follow up on Jordan’s question? Do you want to walk back where you did praise China in January for being transparent about the coronavirus?
Donald Trump: (56:26)
I’m always respectful of China. I’m respectful of other countries. Why wouldn’t I be respectful of China? In the meantime, China’s paid us nothing in your last administration, nothing in any previous administration. They paid us tens of billions of dollars because of what we’ve done. And the trade deal we have, they have to give us $250 billion in purchases. Let’s see if they do that and they’re also paying us 25% or $250 billion in tariffs. So we’re taking in, wait a minute, we’re taking in billions of dollars from China, they never paid us 25 cents. That’s a great thing.
Donald Trump: (57:05)
Now, if they don’t produce or if we find out bad things, we’re not going to be happy. But right now, and we’re doing that, that’s what we’re doing. Look, we have an investigation underway, we’re paying almost $500 million, we have an investigation underway on the World Health Organization. We will find out exactly what went on. And we may be satisfied that it could be remedied and we may be satisfied that it’s so bad that it can’t be remedied. And if it can’t, we’re going to go a different route.
Speaker 12: (57:40)
[inaudible 00:57:40] My question, you are criticizing the W.H.O. for praising China for being transparent, but you also praised China for being transparent-
Donald Trump: (57:47)
I don’t talk about China’s transparency. [crosstalk 00:57:50] Well, if I’m so good to China, how come I was the only person, the only leader of a country that closed our borders tightly against China. And by the way, when I closed our border, that was long ahead of what anybody, you can ask anybody that was in the room, 21 people. I was the one person that wanted to do it. Deborah can tell you that better than anybody. I was the one person that wanted to do it. You know why? Because I don’t believe everything I hear and I close… And if we didn’t close our border early, very early, long before the kind of dates you’re talking about, we would have had thousands and probably hundreds of thousands more death. Please. [Crosstalk 00:58:28] Please, that’s enough.
Speaker 13: (58:29)
Mr. President last week, you said that you would have data in the coming days about the coronavirus’ disproportionate impact on black Americans-
Donald Trump: (58:37)
Yes, that’s being worked on very strongly.
Speaker 13: (58:38)
When will we have that?
Donald Trump: (58:40)
I would say within two weeks and it’s being worked on, Deborah, we’re working on that very strongly.
Speaker 14: (58:44)
The C.D.C.
Donald Trump: (58:45)
Okay, C.D.C. is working, but we’re getting reports on that. Yeah, please go ahead, no, in the back.
Speaker 13: (58:48)
Mr. President, you’re talking about reopening parts of the country by the end of the month and if you do that and as a result you see a spike in cases in those areas-
Donald Trump: (58:58)
But we may not, some countries having some countries haven’t. I’m watching other countries, I’m studying other countries as they open. I mean I don’t want to go into names because for some it would be a little bit embarrassing, but I’m studying other countries as we go along. So on that we have looked at every country that’s opened. Some successfully, some, okay, no total disaster, but some, okay. And some have to go back to the hotspot and fix the hotspot. We think we’re going to do it very successfully. Again, we have one country, but we have lots of different pieces.
Donald Trump: (59:32)
It’s a puzzle. We have beautiful pieces, beautiful states with capable governors. They know when it’s time to open and we don’t want to put pressure on anybody. I’m not going to put any pressure on any governor to open. I’m not going to say to Governor Cuomo, you got to open within seven days. I want him to take his time, do it right, and then open New York. I’m not putting any pressure on the governors. Some of them don’t need pressure or not pressure. I mean, they’re ready to go. And that’s a good thing. So we’ll open it up in beautiful little pieces as it comes along. Please go ahead, behind you.
Speaker 16: (01:00:07)
Yes, just a quick question. You spoke about Governor Cuomo, just wondering if you have any thoughts on some of his remarks from earlier today where he basically said that were New York to be pressured to be open, it would cause a constitutional crisis. And he basically said that you declared yourself King Trump. So I’m wondering if you heard those thoughts-
Donald Trump: (01:00:29)
Yeah, I’ve declared myself as King. You know, I heard he said that, but I didn’t see the remarks. But he understands how we helped him. He needed help. We gave him 2,900 hospital beds. He didn’t use him. We gave him a ship, he didn’t use them. But I’m saying that’s good because you know what that means he didn’t need them. But we said it was too much, but we wanted to err, we said, err on the side of caution as I said. We said, look, we don’t think you need it, but if you do, we’re going to have them built. And the Army Corps of Engineers did a fantastic job and the U.S. Navy did a fantastic job. But we moved the ship that was not meant for COVID and we had it redesigned for COVID, but they still didn’t have very many people going in. We’ll get along just fine, he understands. We’ll get along just fine. Please.
Speaker 17: (01:01:15)
Mr. President-
Speaker 18: (01:01:16)
Mr. President, how do you assure workers in states that may reopen their fear about going back or fear of getting sick?
Donald Trump: (01:01:26)
Talk up, please, louder.
Speaker 18: (01:01:27)
What’s your assurance to workers who are asked to go back to work but are fearful of doing so?
Donald Trump: (01:01:32)
Well, that’s going to be up to the governors. The governors are going to want to make sure everything’s safe. Now, I think that companies can do testing on a maybe weekly basis. You don’t have to do it every day with the same worker, but they can do testing. They could do temperature gauges, they could do a lot of different things. And you know, we’re only talking about for a period of time, eventually we want to get back to where we were. We want people actually sitting next to each other in ballgames eventually. We’re not going to rip out every other seat in baseball stadiums and football stadiums. We want to go back to where we were. I want people to understand that. We’re not going to be like the way you are. We have 300 reporters in the back that want to see, look at this, the way this looks. I don’t even like the way it looks.
Donald Trump: (01:02:14)
Although, I have a lot fewer reporters, that’s okay with me. But look at the way this looks. I’ve never seen anything, John, I’ve never seen anything quite like it. But there are a lot of people, we don’t want this. I don’t want this. I don’t want this. Eventually we’re going back, where restaurants that had 150 seats are going to have 150 seats, not 50 seats because they can’t make it at 50 seats. But more importantly, the atmosphere is even better. We have to get used to it. We have to get used to it. I don’t know that people are going to be shaking hands as readily. Some will. I said to some of the hospital people today, so will people be shaking hands again? And I must say I was a little surprised, most of them said probably, because there is some kind of a thing to it. I was never a big handshaker, but when I ran for politics, I said, I think I better start shaking people’s hand. Go ahead, John.
Speaker 7: (01:03:01)
Mr. President, a couple of financial questions if I could. Larry Kudlow said this morning that the current run rate, the paycheck protection money will run out very soon. The plan to re-up it is stalled in Congress. What can you do as president to try to move that forward?
Donald Trump: (01:03:19)
Well, we’re trying to get it done. The problem is the Democrats want to put all sorts of things, last time they put Kennedy Center and I hated putting Kennedy Center and I have great respect for Kennedy Center. But I hated putting it in the bill because it’s just not appropriate, right? But they wanted it in for whatever reason, they had their own political reason. And John, I said, watch the way that blows up and it blew up, I think it blew up in their face. We want to take care of our workers, we’ll worry about other things and other pet projects of Democrats and also Republicans later. But it’s been a tremendously successful program. I think you see it, the banks have stepped up, hundreds of thousands of loan applications approved, money is going out. It’s been a tremendous program, really has been. And obviously it was at a point where we’re almost, the money will be expired and we could use the refill for the workers. We want to be able to make sure that small businesses stay open, John, and I think that’ll happen. Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 20: (01:04:19)
Thank you, Mr. President. Today, California’s governor set out a list of six criteria for reopening the economy there. Did he consult with you on that? And also you said earlier that there were as many as 20 states that could reopen their economies as early as May 1st, could you list-
Donald Trump: (01:04:38)
No, I didn’t say all of them by May 1st, but there are 20 states. Actually, I was given a number, 29 States who are in very, very good shape. I don’t want to say whether or not the governor spoke with me about that, but we’ve had a very good relationship, Gavin Newsom, very, very good relationship. Yeah, in the back, go ahead.
Speaker 21: (01:04:54)
Mr. President, thank you very much. I have two questions.
Donald Trump: (01:04:57)
One question.
Speaker 21: (01:04:58)
One is from a person who can’t be here and so I-
Donald Trump: (01:05:01)
Who cares? If he can’t be here that’s too bad.
Speaker 21: (01:05:03)
All right. Well, one question that I have is from the United Nations’ economist, Maximo Torero says that there’s a danger that the food supply could be interrupted during this pandemic and I wanted to know what you’re going to do about that?
Donald Trump: (01:05:20)
Well, I think our farmers are incredible. They’re producing levels of food, like just unbelievable. Our transportation, that’s one of the reasons I have the transportation people on the line tomorrow for the delivery of the food. Now we’re doing phenomenally with the food. And I will say the stores, Kroger and Walmart, which does a lot of the food and many of the stores they seem to be in very good shape, but I haven’t heard that at all. We’re going to be very strong on food supply. Okay, how about one more question, go ahead please.
Speaker 22: (01:05:48)
Yeah. The death projections that you mentioned earlier are based on full social distancing until the end of May. So if you ease up on these guidelines now, how many more Americans do you think are going to die?
Donald Trump: (01:05:59)
Well, I’m not easing up. First of all, we’ll have guidelines, even for the states that open and there’ll be guidelines, but we will not have any problem with that. Your question’s a very interesting question, but the states that are opening are not states which will have a problem with that plus they will have to adhere to guidelines until a certain point into the future when the enemy is vanquished.
Speaker 22: (01:06:22)
But the reason they don’t have a problem now is because of social distancing. So if you ease the guidelines-
Donald Trump: (01:06:26)
No, the reason they don’t have … is partially, and some of that will stay in effect. Much of it will stay at effect for a period of time, but the reason also is the different kinds of states. They have lots of room, they have fewer people and they have lots of room. And that’s one of the primary reasons. I want to thank you all very much, so a lot of positive things are happening. We’re going to have some very strong recommendations for the governors. We’re going to work with the governors, the governors are going to do a good job. And if they don’t do a good job, we’re going to come down on them very hard. We’ll have no other choice. Thank you all very much. Thank you. [crosstalk 01:07:01]
Speaker 23: (01:07:01)
On testing, how on Earth are we going to get to a point where we have millions and millions of tests where workers will be tested every day when they go to work."
"Apr 4, 2020",5:54 P.M. EDT,"Speaker 1: (00:00)
Thank you, Doctor Fauci.
Donald Trump: (01:08)
Thank you very much. Busy time, very busy time. And let me begin by again expressing our support, solidarity, and love for the people of our great country. We’re fighting for you and we’re enduring all of this together and we will soon prevail together and they get a lot of progress. We appreciate all of the great assistance from the governors and people within the states, the relationships have been really very good. I spoke with Governor Cuomo, were working very hard to get additional things to New York as quickly as possible. We, as you know, we took care of the hospital including personnel, the 2,500 beds that we built just recently, a Javits including personnel, and we opened it up to COVID and it’s something that we also did in Louisiana and we’re doing it in Dallas. So we have a lot of, not only hospitals being built, but now we’re manning the hospitals because States are in many cases unable to get additional people to work, it’s just an incredible situation. There’s never been anything like this.
Donald Trump: (02:32)
One of the most important issues in battling this pandemic is coordinating the delivery of the crucial supplies throughout the nation based upon the most accurate information available and we’ve got the best healthcare and disaster experts anywhere in the world and everybody will tell you that and we’re dealing with big parts of the world on helping them also through this horrible situation where 151, still 151, nations are going through it. We’re working to ensure that the supplies are delivered where and when they’re needed. In some cases we’re telling governors, “We can’t go there because we don’t think you need it and we think someplace else needs it.” Then pretty much so far we’ve been right about that and we’ll continue to do it as it really gets, this will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week and there’ll be a lot of death unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn’t done, but there will be death.
Donald Trump: (03:35)
We’re looking for an obvious focus and the hardest hit regions. Some of them are obvious and some aren’t so obvious. They spring up. They come and they hit you like you got hit by a club, an area that wasn’t at all bothered. You look at what’s going on in New Jersey. The governor’s doing an excellent job by the way, but how that sprang up. Every decision that we’re making is made to save lives. It’s really our sole consideration. We want to save lives. We want as few lives lost as possible. It’s therefore critical that certain media outlets stop spreading false rumors and creating fear and even panic with the public. It’s just incredible. I could name them, but it’s the same ones always the same ones. I guess they’re looking for ratings, I don’t know what they’re looking for, so bad for our country and so bad that people understand it. You look at the levels and approval ratings are the lowest they’ve ever been for media. It’s so bad for our country, so bad for the world. You got to put it together for a little while, get this over with and then go back to your fakeness. During a national emergency it’s just essential that the federal decision makers cut through the fog of confusion in order to follow the facts and the science.
Donald Trump: (04:58)
Many hospital administrators that we’ve been in touch with, even in the really hot spots, you know what they are, are communicating directly with us that their level of supplies are meeting essential needs and at the current time they’re really thrilled to be where they are. Whenever local shortages are reported, we’re asking states to immediately meet the demand and we’re stockpiling large amounts in different areas, in different areas, and we’re going to be discussing that in a little while, but we want distributions to be made on a fair basis. We have to take care of a large country, not just certain areas of the country. But no matter where we’ve been there and we’ve been there very strong.
Donald Trump: (05:46)
I want to thank FEMA, I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers, I want to thank our military for what they’re doing. And we’re going to be adding a tremendous amount of military to help supplement the states. Thousands of soldiers, thousands of medical workers, professionals, nurses, doctors, and it’ll be a large number, it’ll be, we’ll be telling them over the next very short period where they’re going. They’re going into war, they’re going into a battle that they’ve never really trained for. Nobody’s trained for this, nobody’s seen this, I would say since 1917 which was the greatest of them all. The greatest of this type of battle, probably the greatest of them all right? 1917. Up to a hundred million people were killed.
Donald Trump: (06:39)
In addition, we’re working directly with hospitals and existing suppliers and distributors to ensure that those with the greatest need are prioritized and that need changes. One day it’s one state or one locale, one city, and then all of a sudden they’re starting to do well. We had some very good reports coming out of the state of Washington, coming out of various parts of California, so areas that we were getting ready to really hit hard, we can now go to other areas. It looks like New York is going to be hit very hard and Louisiana is just amazing the way it just spread up and everyone’s doing a good job, but they’re going to be hit hard. Areas in the country that are not experiencing large scale infections are requesting supplies beyond what their present circumstances require and we talked to them or we tell them and we explain it and for the most part they’re good with it. We think we’re right.
Donald Trump: (07:36)
It’s very understandable that officials would seek to get the most they can get for their communities, but the fears of the shortages have led to inflated requests. We have some states and areas where they’re just asking for far more. Look, we had one state asking for 40,000 ventilators, 40,000 think of it. 40, 000. It’s not possible. They won’t need that many and now they’re admitting they don’t need that many, but we’re getting as many as we can to them.
Donald Trump: (08:10)
Again, nobody’s ever seen anything like this in terms of ventilators, in terms of protective equipment and uniforms and outfits, but it makes it more difficult for distributors to prioritize the real need and it could intentionally and everybody has proper intentions but they want to make sure they’re 100% and sometimes when they know they don’t need it, they want it anyway. It gives them that extra feeling of satisfaction, but we just can’t do that. It’s not even possible to think about it. And that’s why, and we’re backup. Remember we’re a backup. We’re the greatest backup that ever existed for the states, especially when we start getting into hospital building business and getting into the medical center building business. When you see we built many hospitals, numerous hospitals in some states and medical centers. That’s why my administration’s been requesting actual usage numbers directly from the States and hospitals to meet their needs because we want to be ready when the brunt of it comes, which is coming quickly, you see it, you see it as sure as you can see it, and when the brunt of it comes, we want to be ready to hit the area that needs it. We don’t want to have spent everything in one area and they don’t need it there to anywhere near the extent.
Donald Trump: (09:31)
So, let me be extremely clear about one point. We will move heaven and earth to safeguard our great American citizens. We will continue to use every power, every authority, every single resource, we’ve got to keep our people healthy, safe, secure, and to get this thing over with. We want to finish this war. We have to get back to work. We have to open our country again. We have to open our country again. We don’t want to be doing this for months and months and months. We’re going to open our country again. This country wasn’t meant for this fewer, fewer, but we have to open our country again.
Donald Trump: (10:17)
I just spoke with the commissioners, leaders of, I would say virtually all of the sports leagues. Rob Manfred, Commissioner of Baseball, Major League Baseball, Roger Goodell, Commissioner of the National Football League, Adam Silver, Commissioner of the National Basketball Association, Gary Bettman, Commissioner of the National Hockey League, Jay Monaghan, Commissioner of the PGA Tour, Cathy Engelbert, Commissioner of the Women’s National Basketball Association. Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Vince McMan, President of the WWE, Don Garber, Commissioner of Major League Soccer, Steve Phelps, President of NASCAR, Michael Wahn, Commissioner of the LPGA, Roger Penske, founder and Chairman Penske Corp and Drew Fleming, President of the Breeders’ Cup, and there were a couple of others on and these are all the great leaders of sport and they want to get back, they got to get back. They can’t do this. The sports weren’t designed for it. The whole concept of our nation wasn’t designed for, we’re going to have to get back. We want to get back soon. Very soon.
Donald Trump: (11:36)
For example, and I have to say we’re using the Defense Production Act very powerfully and sometimes directly, in many cases indirectly, just the threat of it’s usually enough, but FEMA and HHS have ordered 180 million, think of that, 180 million who have a herd of 180,000,000 N95 masks? And we’re working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out, but we want them to help our country and I think it’s going to be okay. We’re going to soon let you know, but we need the masks. We don’t want other people getting it. That’s why we’re instituting a lot of Defense Production Act … You could call it retaliations because that’s what it is. It’s a retaliation. If people don’t, if people don’t give us what we need for our people, we’re going to be very tough and we’ve been very tough. Usually we don’t have to use it, but we’ve used it plenty. It’s turning out more and more unfortunately, and it works very well.
Donald Trump: (12:48)
Our supply chain logistics task force led by Admiral John Polowczyk is doing a fantastic job, will ensure they are distributed through the healthcare and critical infrastructure workers in the areas with the most pressing requirements. That’s the 60 million masks that we’re talking about and the 180,000,000 N95 mass, 180 million, whoever heard of 180 million masks? And this is a incredible thing. A lot of times that we have to stop playing this game, if a governor wants 200 ventilators and I say “No, we’re going to send you a thousand, we think you need more than 200,” and then the media meets with the governor and they say, “Oh you got more, well, it’s not enough. The president should have sent more.” So he’s asking for 200 we give him thousand, they say, “How’s the president doing? He should have given more,” because that’s politics. That’s politics. And that’s unfortunate because we can’t play that game. And you know that’s one party doing it and the other party’s happy, but they’re all really happy because they should have been doing this work themselves for a long period of time.
Donald Trump: (14:05)
Many of their cupboards were bare with respect to the ventilators. FEMA and HHS continued to monitor the data on an hourly basis where provided by the States in order to most effectively target the distribution of supplies. We’ve been asking States to provide us with daily updates on the number of ventilators and their utilization rates because some states have more ventilators than they need. They don’t even like to admit it. They’ll admit it when everything’s over, but that’s doesn’t help us very much. This data is vitally necessary so that we can ensure ventilators are getting to the right place at the right time. FEMA, HHS, DOD are developing resources within the next 24 hours. They will have a whole different set of criteria every day. It’s different criteria every day. This horrible invisible enemy changes. Of course, it changes course.
Donald Trump: (15:05)
If you were fighting the normal fight, you know what’s happening. Here’s, they hit one, they hit another. They had another state. They hit areas that you didn’t expect, but we’re watching it and we’re capturing it. Our goal is to stay several days ahead of the needs in each state, but we can only do that if the cities and states utilize real time, local knowledge to provide timely and precise data about actual usage. So, we have to be able to do that.
Donald Trump: (15:37)
And if a state has ventilators, as an example, that they know they’re not going to need, they should give them over and we should move them with the other ones. We have now 10,000 in our pipeline and stockpiled 10,000 close and we’re moving some into New York because we’re going to need some additional, we’re moving some into New York City and State separately and we’re bringing them to the point where they’ll need them.
Donald Trump: (16:05)
I can also report that at my direction, 1000 military personnel are deploying to New York City to assist where they’re needed the most. That’s the hottest of all the hotspots. New Jersey is right there. It’s right next to it and I don’t know if that’s overflow, but New Jersey’s, it’s a great state and it’s a very, it’s a crowded state also where you have people on top of people. It’s always tough, but we’re bringing some of the ventilators. We got some for New Jersey just yesterday and we’re going to bring them some more including doctors. We’re getting doctors, nurses, respiratory specialist, and other support workers. These are from the military. We’re taking people now out of our military. We’ve been doing it, but now we’re doing it on a larger basis and I want to thank Secretary of Defense Esper who will detail some of what we’re doing tomorrow and Monday.
Donald Trump: (16:56)
As the situation in Washington State continues to stabilize, we’re returning a 300 bed federal medical station to a different location, so where we need it and we appreciate that they won’t be needing it and we appreciate them letting us know we’re going to move it to a different location. It was already built.
Donald Trump: (17:18)
Many governors initially made large requests for federal support for their states in anticipation of a greater number of cases, but the residents of Washington State have done a really good job of following the federal distancing guidelines. They really have.
Donald Trump: (17:35)
I’m also pleased to report that Oregon will be spending and sending. They’re spending a lot of money because they really did stockpile well and they’re also sending 140 ventilators directly to New York, which we appreciate.
Donald Trump: (17:50)
And I want to thank the Vice President for the great work he’s doing every day dealing with our nation’s governors. Mike Pence has been working day and night on this and we want to get it over. He’s got to get a little more sleep than he’s getting. He hasn’t been getting very much, I will tell you that, and we’re all in this together. It’s a beautiful thing to see how people are joining forces to help one another. They really are.
Donald Trump: (18:15)
In addition to our courageous doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, I also want to thank the incredible food supply workers who are feeding our nation. I spoke just a little while ago to Senator Bozeman, you know Senator Bozeman, we all do, he’s a great Senator, he’s a great person. We spoke just this morning and we discussed how important it is to keep our farmers and ranchers, processors and distributors in our nation’s prayers and I want to thank the Senator for the incredible job he’s been doing. And a lot of the senators and congressmen and everyone. Everybody’s working very hard.
Donald Trump: (18:56)
My administration is working very aggressively to pioneer new medical countermeasures to treat and prevent infection working on a lot of things. We must utilize our nation’s scientific brilliance to vanquish the virus. We have to vanquish the virus as quickly as we can because we have a lot of things happening in this country and we have a great future, but we have to get back to work.
Donald Trump: (19:29)
This week the FDA established the Coronavirus treatment accelerator program, which is expediting the development of new antiviral and other therapies and they’re doing it on a very rapid basis and I think we’re having some very good results. We’ll tell you about that.
Donald Trump: (19:49)
HHS continues to speed the development of therapies derived from human blood that have the potential to lessen the severity or shorten the length of the illness. And as you know, last Saturday the FDA also gave emergency authorization for hydroxy chloroquine and the hydroxy chloroquine is a, I hope it’s going to be a very important answer. We’re having some very good things happening with it and we’re going to be distributing it through the strategic national stockpile. It’s going into these strategic national stockpile to treat certain patients and we have millions and millions of doses of it, 29 million to be exact. In addition to that, we’re making it and we’re also getting it from various other locations and countries. In one case I called Prime Minister Modi of India this morning, they make large amounts of hydroxy chloroquine very large amounts frankly.
Donald Trump: (21:02)
And I said, they had a hold because you know they have 1.5 billion people and they think a lot of it and I said I’d appreciate if they would release the amounts that we ordered and they are giving it serious consideration. But India makes a lot of it, but we have already 29 million, if you look it’s a big number, 29 million doses and we’ve got millions of doses that are being made here and many millions of doses that are made elsewhere that are being shipped here and it will be arriving. We’re just hearing really positive stories and we’re continuing to collect the data, but I’ll just speak for myself. It’s been out for a long time.
Donald Trump: (21:53)
It’s a malaria drug. It’s also a drug for lupus and there’s a study out that people with lupus aren’t catching this horrible virus, they’re not affected so much by it. Now, maybe that’s correct. Maybe it’s false. You’re going to have to check it out, but there’s a lot of very positive things happening with that. That’s a game changer. If that’s the case, obviously we continue to work on the vaccines, but the vaccines have to be down the road by probably 14, 15, 16 months.
Donald Trump: (22:25)
We’re doing great on the vaccines. I think Johnson and Johnson is leading … Seems to be leading in terms of the studies, but we’ll see what happens. But I feel good about that. But that’s down the road. But a tremendous promise with what’s just been mentioned.
Donald Trump: (22:43)
In addition to that, Gilead Sciences has initiated a phase three that’s down the line, meaning clinical studies of the drug, remdesivir, now it’s approximately 1,000 patients, which is a pretty good study. Other drugs are also being studied in patients and this week Oracle, great company donated a new web portal. Larry Ellison, amazing guy and platform to the government to gather real time data on how patients are responding to the various new treatments and they have a very sophisticated site. We’ll be learning a lot from Oracle and thank you to them.
Donald Trump: (23:26)
We’re also spending economic dollars like you wouldn’t believe and speeding economic relief to American workers, families, and businesses. Yesterday the Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection Program to help employees keep paying their workers. In 24 hours, the Small Business Administration and over 1,200 lending partners processed over 28,000 loans. It’s so far ahead of schedule and billions and billions of dollars. It’s worked out incredibly well and I want to thank Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase and a lot of the big banks that have been involved and a lot of the community banks, community banks have really jumped on it and it’s a so far going way ahead of schedule. The SBA also clarified that faith-based organizations, including houses of worship, are eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program. That’s great. As well as the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program that you’re familiar with on the same terms as every other applicant. If we run out of funding for the Employee Retention Program, I will immediately ask Congress for more money. This is money that’s really going directly to the people that need it, the small businesses that need it and the workers that need it.
Donald Trump: (24:54)
Finally, because when we open, we want to open strong with businesses that are going. Remember we had the greatest economy in the world and then one day we were told, “You got to shut it down. Stop it. Tell everyone to stay home because of this horrible virus.” And we did that and we did the right thing, but now we have to open. We have to open our country.
Donald Trump: (25:18)
Finally, I can report that as of today, the State Department has successfully coordinated the safe return of more than 40,000 Americans stuck abroad on over 400 flights from 75 countries. Many of those countries were terrific in helping us and I appreciate that very much. Some of them, I had to call the leaders of the country, most of whom I know, and once I did, they snapped like you wouldn’t believe. They really helped us great, so I appreciate that. So we brought back 40,000 Americans who were literally stuck in some countries with no chance of getting out. We got them back. 400 flights, 75 countries. Think of that. And those countries in almost every instance had a big problem with a virus.
Donald Trump: (26:02)
I want to thank the American people, most of all for the selfless sacrifices that they’re making for our nation. I know it’s not pleasant. Although some people have said they’ve gotten to know their family better and they love their family more than ever, and that’s a beautiful thing. They’ve actually gotten to know them. They’re in the same house with their family for a long time. I guess it can also work the other way perhaps, but we don’t want to talk about that.
Donald Trump: (26:29)
And I want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on slowing the spread. Sustaining this war effort is, and that’s what it is, it’s a war effort, is the patriotic duty of every citizen. While we may be more physically distant for a time, we’re closer together in the heart and in the spirit and through this great national unity is happening, we’re having a great unity developing that a lot of people didn’t think it would be possible to develop like this and we will conquer the disease and restore our nation to its full and
Donald Trump: (27:03)
… the disease and restore our nation to its full and glorious might. We’re doing really well and I’m very proud of everybody out there. We’re very proud of you. It’s something that nobody could have ever projected. It’s been over a hundred years that a thing like this has happened. And the problem with this one is the contagion. It’s so contagious. Nobody’s ever seen anything like that where it’s so contagious. You can be feet away and just talking to somebody and catch it. You can catch it … you know how long it can live on surfaces. So things that nobody even thought of, the level of contagion.
Donald Trump: (27:40)
So we’re getting there. We’re going to make sure that it’s over soon and just keep going. It’s not going to be long and thank you very much. And with that, I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn to speak and he’s been doing yeoman’s work at the FDA. Thank you very much, doctor. Thank you.
Dr. Hahn: (28:04)
Thank you, Mr. President. I’m going to speak about hydroxychloroquine and the efforts around that. Just a preface, I’d like to echo what the president said about the American people, and the resiliency, and the just terrific work. Mitigation is such an important part of our fight against the COVID-19 virus. Last week as the president said, we issued an emergency use authorization to allow the donated hydroxychloroquine to come into the country and enter the general circulation. We are prioritizing this drug to come in for clinical trials, also to general use for physicians because, as you know, physicians, based upon their interaction with the patients, their assessment of the risks and benefits, can write a prescription for hydroxychloroquine if they think it’s appropriate for that patient. Being a physician, we do this all the time, and that assessment needs to be done between a patient and a doctor. And then the third portion is we wanted to make sure that these drugs were in the supply chain so that people who have them or need them for the other indications, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, had them available. So that was the purpose of the emergency use authorization.
Dr. Hahn: (29:15)
One other thing I’d like to mention is that we, on Friday, stood up a formal convalescent plasma program. We have a great deal of enthusiasm for that. There are some reports that this is of benefit to patients in other countries who have had the COVID-19 virus. And what this means is taking plasma from patients who’ve had the virus and who have recovered, and transferring the immunity, the immunoglobulins if you will, the immunity from that person to someone who’s sick. And we’re, hopefully, expanding that across the country. The Red Cross is involved in that program and I think it shows a great promise. It needs to be studied like other things, but just like I said before, it provides hope. We don’t want to provide false hope, but definitely hope. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (29:59)
Tony, please.
Dr. Fauci: (30:02)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I’d like to just take a couple of moments to talk a little bit about the public health aspects and how it relates to what the president just said about the need for us to begin to at least think about returning to some degree of normality. And that has to do with what’s going to be happening as we end this week and we go into next week.
Dr. Fauci: (30:22)
You will be seeing, and we should not be surprised because the kinetics of how this virus works, is that we’re going to be seeing that they’re going to be deaths that are going to continue to go up. But as I mentioned to this group and to the general public multiple times, there really is a cascading of events where you have new cases, hospitalizations, intensive care, and deaths. So at the same time that we may be seeing an increase in deaths, we want to focus on … The effect of mitigation is really the number of new cases, and that’s what we’re going to be thinking about and looking about. So we’re going to pay close attention to that. And hopefully the kinds of mitigations that we’re talking about are going to have the impact to allow us to begin to think about maybe changing a bit.
Dr. Fauci: (31:08)
So the question arises is is the mitigation working? So let’s look historically and then just look at the reality of it. Clearly in the countries, China included, that have implemented very strict kinds of programs of mitigation, clearly it works. In our own country, we’ve seen indication of that in Washington. Remember Washington state was the first to get hit, but they put in a really good program of mitigation. And if you look at the charts that Dr. Birx showed the other day, they’re still down there doing well.
Dr. Fauci: (31:42)
And the reason is, again, what I’ve said before, but I think it’s worth reiterating, that we have two opposing forces here. The virus, which wants to do what the virus wants to do, viruses transmit from people to people. When people are separated from each other, virus does not transmit. It doesn’t go anywhere. And that’s the reason why something as simple as the physical separation … Because if you look at the vice president’s chart that he shows all the time here from this podium, every aspect of that ending the COVID outbreak in 30 days has, some aspect of it, a physical separation. Whether that’s avoiding crowds, whether that’s staying six feet away from people, whether that’s doing teleworking, all of it does that. That’s our most important tool. We’ll be talking about vaccines and drugs and things like that that will mitigate later, but this is what we really have to do. And I want to actually just plead, as I do multiple times from here, to the American public. As sobering and as difficult as this is, what we are doing is making a difference. So we really need to continue to do that.
Dr. Fauci: (32:53)
I must tell you, I was just mentioning to the vice president as we came in, last night when I wasn’t here … I went out with my wife and actually did a little power walking down Massachusetts Avenue. Those who live in Washington know what I’m talking about. And we passed a couple of restaurants where people were getting takeout food. The restaurants were closed to people going in, but they were open to takeout. And I saw something that absolutely made me feel really, really good. They were separating themselves by at least six feet. In fact, some of the restaurants had little things on the floor that said, “Stand here and then stand there.” And I think if we as a nation pulled together to do that, hopefully when we keep coming back here at these press conferences, we’ll be able to show you that that curve that we keep talking about is going in the right direction. And I’d be happy to answer questions later. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (33:47)
Thank you. Okay, please.
Speaker 3: (33:51)
You said earlier that the virus is springing up in areas you did not expect. Yesterday, you said some States in the country are not in jeopardy. The fact that this is unpredictable, isn’t that an argument for every state to have one of these [crosstalk 00:34:04]?
Donald Trump: (34:04)
I don’t think so. There are some States that you have great distance, natural distance, big land, few people, and they’re in very good shape. And if there is a case, they can quarantine that person or that person will be separated, will be brought to a hospital, a secure area. So you do have different cases as opposed to a New York or Los Angeles. Los Angeles is doing incredibly well by the way. But areas where you have lots of people tight together is a big difference. So no, there are many different cases. Please?
Speaker 4: (34:36)
You mentioned the military off the top. So a thousand troops go into New York, and then are we expecting other mass deployments around the country? And then is it just army? Is it-
Donald Trump: (34:45)
Many of the places are really in great shape, they really have done a fantastic job, and we may add to the thousand. But New York will be getting about a thousand military people, nurses, doctors, lots of other people because that’s what they need. [crosstalk 00:35:01] Medical, no, no, medical military. Please?
Speaker 5: (35:05)
Sir, you tweeted earlier today that you liked the idea of a second coronavirus task force that was focused on reopening the economy. I was wondering if you were planning to go forward with that?
Donald Trump: (35:15)
Thinking about it, getting a group of people. We have to open our country. I had an expression: The cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. I started by saying that and I continue to say it. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. We’ve got to get our country open.
Speaker 6: (35:38)
[inaudible 00:35:38] reopening. Can you talk about your call with the sports commissioners? Did you say you’d like to see people back, fans back in arenas?
Donald Trump: (35:44)
Absolutely, I want fans back in the arenas. I think it’s [crosstalk 00:35:48] … No, whenever we’re ready. As soon as we can, obviously. And the fans want to be back too. They want to see basketball, and baseball, and football, and hockey. They want to see their sports, they want to go out onto the golf courses and breathe nice, clean, beautiful, fresh air.
Speaker 6: (36:05)
[crosstalk 00:09:07].
Donald Trump: (36:08)
I can’t tell you a date, but I think it’s going to be sooner rather than later. We’re not going to have to have separation for the rest of our times on the planet. We need it for this period of time, but eventually people are going to be able to occupy those seats in arenas next to each other like we have for all of my life and all of your life. They want to sit next to each other at restaurants. They don’t want to be six feet away.
Donald Trump: (36:37)
Some restaurant man called up. He said, “I’m worried because I have a small restaurant with not too many seats.” I think he said 120. And he said, “If I practice what this is, I’m down to 30 seats. I can’t make it.” I said, “Don’t worry about it. That’s for a short period of time. You’ll be back to your number of seats.” We can’t do that. Otherwise you’re making everything. That means your stadium is half the size of what it was a month ago. No, no, they’re going to be close together, but they’re going to be breathing air that’s not infected, that’s not going to kill people. Please?
Speaker 7: (37:09)
Since you’re not getting ready to pack the stadiums by August, what are your-
Donald Trump: (37:13)
I’m not committing to it. We’re going to see where we are. That’d be great if we could. But we’re going to be back to good health soon, in my opinion. We’re making a lot of progress. And we’re making progress because, as Tony told a story about the restaurant and about how they were separated sort of automatically, people are doing that. They’re staying in their homes, they don’t want to go out, they’re doing what they know is the right thing to do. It’s not very complicated. In many ways, it’s a very beautiful thing to see. Yeah?
Speaker 8: (37:45)
[inaudible 00:37:45] contingency plans for the Republican National Convention?
Donald Trump: (37:48)
We have no contingency plan. We’re having the convention at the end of August and we think by the end of August we’ll be in good shape. We have no contingency. It’s going to be in North Carolina, as you know, in Charlotte, and I think we’re going to have a great convention. I notice … I think we had an opponent, but I almost didn’t know who it was. He got .00001% of the vote, but I heard he dropped out three or four weeks ago. I’m not sure, maybe you could tell me. That’s the kind of opponent I had, and hopefully we have another one just like that in Joe.
Speaker 9: (38:24)
Mr. President, this weekend, lawmakers are working on the next round of relief packages. What was not in the stimulus package that you signed last week that you would like to see in phase four?
Donald Trump: (38:32)
Well, I think we’re going to need more money for the small businesses. It’s been working out so well, it’s been so efficient. The banks have been doing an incredible job. I think we’re going to need more money there. I think, we’ll see. But based on the first couple of days, it’s been incredible. I think that restaurants and entertainment, that would be sports leagues, all forms of entertainment, go back to the original where they get tax deductibility for what they’re doing, and for people who come in and buy tickets or go out for meals. And corporations can then send people into these restaurants who are going to have a hard time otherwise opening in my opinion. And that could be the same for the sports leagues.
Donald Trump: (39:13)
So we want to see, for entertainment and for restaurants, deductibility, so that corporations can take a deduction. They’ll send their executives, they’ll send people there, and they get a deduction. That is something that will really bring life back to the restaurants, I think. Make them hotter than before. They used to have it, and when they ended it, it was really never the same. It was never the same. Yeah, please?
Speaker 10: (39:36)
Mr. President, you just said that you want to see us few lives lost as possible in this pandemic. But there are still eight governors, all Republicans, who have refused to issue these statewide stay at home orders. Your own experts, including Dr. Fauci, have said stay at home orders are the most effective way to stop the spread of this virus. So why not do everything possible [crosstalk 00:39:57] right now to do that?
Donald Trump: (40:00)
We have a thing called the constitution, which I cherish, number one. Number two, those governors, I know every one of them, they’re doing a great job. They’re being very, very successful in what they’re doing. And as you know, I want the governors to be running things. Now in some cases, we’ll supersede, but in this case it’s not [crosstalk 00:40:20]. It depends on the individual state that you’re talking about. But they’re doing very well, and they’re doing a magnificent job in running their states.
Speaker 10: (40:28)
South Carolina has 1700 cases right now of coronavirus. Utah has 1,255. Are these not States that you think should have the stay at home order?
Donald Trump: (40:36)
No, I think they’re doing a great job. That’s a very small number relative to population.
Speaker 10: (40:40)
It’s larger than some states that do have stay at home orders.
Donald Trump: (40:43)
It’s up to them. If I saw something wrong, if I saw a massive breakout, of which that’s not, I would come down very hard.
Speaker 10: (40:51)
Isn’t the key to this pandemic getting ahead of those numbers though?
Donald Trump: (40:54)
No, not in that case, but in the case … I know the states you’re talking about. By the way, I think you’re up to 92% of the country is covered. And from a constitutional standpoint, they made the difference, they called the shots. Yes, Jeff, go ahead?
Speaker 11: (41:08)
Mr. President, just a question about messaging. You and the others here are saying people need to continue following the mitigation efforts, but they’re also saying again, the cure must not be worse than the problem. Which is it?
Donald Trump: (41:21)
I’m just saying we have to get this country open, Jeff. It has to get open. This country was not designed to be closed. So we have the greatest we’ve ever had and then we’re paying people to stay home? Well, think of it. We’re paying people not to go to work. How about that? How does that play? And they want to go to work, by the way. They don’t want money. This country is great. But we’re paying people, we have to get back to work. That’s what I’m saying. Go ahead, please?
Speaker 12: (41:50)
Mr. President, this is off topic. It’s about the announcement from last night. It’s a yes or no question, not that we expect the answer to be yes or no. But wasn’t Michael Atkinson doing the job of the inspector general of the intelligence community, the job he was supposed to do, when he simply took the whistleblower complaint to Congress, what hadn’t been taken previously? Wasn’t he doing the job that he was supposed to do, that American taxpayers were paying him to do? And why did you decide to terminate him?
Donald Trump: (42:19)
I thought he did a terrible job, absolutely terrible. He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to be a fake report … it was fake, it was totally wrong. It was about my conversation with the president of Ukraine. He took a fake report and he brought it to Congress with an emergency. Not a big Trump fan, that I can tell you. Instead of saying, and we offered this to him, “No, no, we will tape the conversation” … we’re fortunate we had that transcript. If we didn’t have a transcript, with the kind of a deception and dishonesty that were practiced by the Democrats, I might not be standing here right now. Fortunately, we had a transcript. And it was a perfect transcript because even the Lieutenant Colonel admitted it was correct.
Donald Trump: (43:07)
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute. You asked that question. So he took this whistleblower and I keep saying, where’s the whistleblower, and why was the whistleblower allowed to do this? Why was he allowed to be, you call it, fraudulent or incorrect transcript. So we offered this IG … I don’t know him, I don’t think I ever met him, he never even came in to see me. How can you do that without seeing the person? He never came into see me, never requested to see me. He took this terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report, and he brought it to Congress. We offered to have him see my exact conversation. It was all about the conversation, by the way. That was the whole thing. It was about the conversation. And then after he saw it, he must have said, “Wow,” because, as I’ve said it many times, and it drives you people crazy, it was a perfect conversation.
Donald Trump: (43:58)
So instead of going and saying, ” Gee, this is a terrible thing he said about the president’s conversation,” well it was a fraud. I didn’t say that. And by the way, you have the whistle blower. Where’s the informer? And here’s another question. Remember before I gave the transcript, in other words, before I revealed the real conversation, where’s the second whistleblower? Remember the second whistle … wait, wait, wait, wait. There was going to be a second whistleblower. But after I gave the conversation, he just went away. He miraculously went away. Where’s the informer? Because there was going to be this informer … Maybe Schiff was the informant. You ever think of that? He’s a corrupt guy, he’s a corrupt politician.
Donald Trump: (44:41)
So listen, I say this. Where’s the informer? Remember, the informer was coming forward. Because, see, I did one that surprised everybody. This gentleman right here said, “Boy, that was a shocker.” I revealed the conversation. I got approval from Ukraine, because I didn’t want to do it without their approval. And they said, “Absolutely, you did nothing wrong.” By the way, president of Ukraine, Foreign Minister said, “He did nothing wrong.” And over that, with 196 to nothing vote by the Republicans, not one dissenting Republican vote, dishonest Democrats impeached a president of the United States. That man is a disgrace to IGs. All right, let’s go, next. Please? [crosstalk 00:45:24] He was a total disgrace.
Speaker 13: (45:26)
Did you run by your decision to dismiss the inspector general by a Senator?
Donald Trump: (45:32)
We’ll get off this because people want to talk about what we’re talking about. But let me just tell you something. That’s my decision. I have the absolute right. Even the fake news last night said, “He has the absolute right to do it.” But ask him, “Why didn’t you go and see the actual conversation?” There was no rush. He said, “Oh, we have to rush it.” He even said it was politically biased. He actually said. The report could have been, you know who the whistle blower is, and so do you, and so does everybody in this room, and so do I. Everybody knows, but they give this whistleblower status that he doesn’t deserve. He’s a fake whistleblower. And frankly, somebody ought to sue his ass off. All right, that’s enough of the whistleblower. Go ahead, please?
Speaker 14: (46:14)
The governor of New York today said that he is still desperate for ventilators and that he has accepted a thousand of them from the Chinese government. Are you concerned-?
Donald Trump: (46:22)
What he didn’t say is … okay, let me tell you what he didn’t say. Two very good friends of mine brought him those ventilators. Two very good friends of mine, they brought them. If you’d like their name, I’ll give you their name. [crosstalk 00:46:40] No, but the governor didn’t mention that it came through the Chinese, the country of China, but they were given by two friends of mine. But he didn’t tell you that.
Donald Trump: (46:50)
Now the governor also … you’ll see when you read the letter. The governor also asked for 40,000, he wanted 40,000 ventilators. Now the governor, as you know, had a chance to get 16,000 a few years ago. He decided not to get that. The state of New York has asked for help. I’ve given him four hospitals, four medical centers, then I gave him an additional hospital, then I gave a military people to operate the hospital. They were not supposed to be COVID hospitals. Interesting thing happened with the ship. People aren’t in accidents because there’s nobody driving. There’s nobody taking motorcycle rides down the West Side Highway at a hundred miles an hour. People are away so people aren’t being injured. Now they’re asking whether or not we could open up the ship for COVID.
Donald Trump: (47:39)
We have given the governor of New York more than anybody has ever been given in a long time, I’ll just say. I was going to say in history, but in a long time. And I think he’s happy. But I think that, because I watched what he said today, and it was fine. I wouldn’t say gracious, it wasn’t gracious, it was okay. I must tell you, Gavin Newsome has been gracious, Los Angeles, California, the job we’ve done, and all of California.
Speaker 14: (48:04)
Why does that matter if they’re gracious or not gracious?
Donald Trump: (48:08)
It doesn’t matter, but I think when we’ve given as much as we’ve given to New York, somebody should say, “Nice.” I’ll tell you who has been very nice: Mayor de Blasio has been very nice. He understands what we’ve given him. We brought him some more ventilators to yesterday. But nobody has been given like New York. And I know he appreciates it, he just can’t quite get the words out. But that’s okay.
Speaker 14: (48:33)
But when he says that he needs 20,000-
Donald Trump: (48:36)
Yes, go ahead?
Speaker 14: (48:38)
Back to Dr. Fauci’s comments-
Donald Trump: (48:40)
To which one?
Speaker 14: (48:40)
Dr. Fauci’s comments on mitigation. On the reproductive value of the virus, the WHO had it up to 2 to 2.6, others had it a percentage point or two higher. Do we have a new number now based on those mitigation techniques? Have we managed to bring it down?
Donald Trump: (48:58)
Well, doctor, I think maybe you should answer that, right? Dr. Birx, please. [crosstalk 00:49:02] Yeah, sure, go ahead.
Dr. Birx: (49:05)
You know, it’s an excellent question. And it’s why all of the modelers, and I really want to thank them again, they’re reevaluating all of their models in light of the level of the impact of the mitigation. Remember, none of us had really been through this before, so when we modeled school closures, and distancing, and staying at home, and all of these pieces, that had never really come into the model before. They’re working on that very diligently now. Of course, just to be clear, we won’t know how valid the models are until we move all the way through the epidemic.
Dr. Birx: (49:39)
what we’re triangulating right now, and instead of working on our R not, we’re looking at testing and triangulating, testing, positive cases, hospitalizations, ICUs and, of course, the recoveries, because that’s also very important to us. I think it’s very important that the American people know that there are equal number of States with less than 5% positives despite high levels of testing. So there are States that are mitigating and making this work. There are also the States that you know of, the 18 States that have the larger outbreaks, and we’re watching them very carefully, triangulating for them all of the information to ensure that clients who come to the hospital are cared for.
Dr. Birx: (50:27)
And then there are states in the middle that we’re trying to figure out are they changing or not. Each of those states, and each of those epidemics within those states, may have a different R value, and that is what we’re trying to figure out. It’s very variable on each of these factors. But the bottom line is, and I think going into this weekend, it’s really important for the American people to know this, Spain and Italy are moving through this. They are seeing their number of cases drop, they’re seeing the number of people in hospitals drop. We are about, on our models and on the actual data, about 12 days behind them.
Dr. Birx: (51:08)
At the same time we see in the United States really good case studies of the impact that Washington state, of California, and then a series of smaller States where we’re trying to learn from them how to do surveillance. And with these new HHS Abbott ID now kits, and I just want to thank Admiral Giroir for getting them out, being able to look at testing in a more comprehensive way, so we can be doing surveillance and mitigation simultaneously so we can answer that very question. It’s going to be very difficult to answer at this moment across the United States, because each Metro cluster is on a different pathway as they move through the epidemic. And I think we just really ought to emphasize through, because we see Italy, we see Spain moving through. And we hope to be in that same position.
Dr. Birx: (52:05)
At the same time, as the president said, he’s concerned about every single person that is succumbing to this virus. We all are. And that’s why we’re making sure that in this triangulation, they’re tracking minute-by-minute. When we say FEMA and HHS is tracking minute-by-minute the ventilator, hospital, and ICU bed need, that’s exactly what’s happening. And also being flexible and responsive. To have DOD take a thousand healthcare providers out of their medical corps is a very big deal. I was in the medical corps for 29 years. We never did that. So this is saying we respect and understand the importance and value of the American lives and doing that. But the R values will be variable by state.
Donald Trump: (52:57)
Before I do that, we had breaking news last night, you know that, you saw that, where I think the probable presidential candidate for the Democrats will be Joe Biden, and he agreed that I was correct when I stopped people from China very early, very, very early from coming into our country. And Dr. Fauci said that was a very big moment because it would be a much different picture we have right now had we allowed thousands and thousands of people from a specific area, I don’t have to go into it, from China, to come in highly infected. It would’ve been a very different thing.
Donald Trump: (53:32)
So I appreciate the fact that he did, because I was called xenophobic, racist, I was called many things when I did that very early. And I got a lot of credit for it in The Federalist because The Federalist covered the whole journey. And they said, “Trump was,” … I didn’t speak to the author, respected author. They said, “Trump was right at every single move, and on top of that, he was going through a fake impeachment, a hoax.” I was going through a hoax when I made the decision. And that does take a little time, and certainly a little-
Donald Trump: (54:03)
… When I made the decision and that does take a little time and certainly a little thinking time, but I appreciated the fact that Joe Biden announced last night that he now agrees that I was correct. You saw the report come out that I was correct when I stopped people from China coming in at a very early date.
Speaker 16: (54:19)
Mr. President, can we talk about Captain Crozier of the USS Roosevelt?
Donald Trump: (54:23)
Which one? What?
Speaker 16: (54:23)
Captain Crozier that was removed as the commander of USS Roosevelt. I don’t know if you saw the videos of sailors cheering for him as he left. Our reporting shows that some sailors have said that they are worried to re-enlist because they are not convinced that commanders are taking care of their health and taking care of them.
Donald Trump: (54:42)
Yeah.
Speaker 16: (54:43)
What do you say to them? And how does removing this captain-?
Donald Trump: (54:44)
Well, I don’t know much about it. I can only tell you this. Here we have one of the greatest ships in the world, nuclear aircraft carrier, incredible ship with thousands and thousands of people. And you had about 120 that were infected.
Donald Trump: (54:59)
Now, I guess the captain stopped in Vietnam and people got off in Vietnam. Perhaps you don’t do that in the middle of a pandemic or something that looked like it was going to be. History would say you don’t necessarily stop and let your sailors get off, number one. But more importantly, he wrote a letter. The letter was a five-page letter from a captain, and the letter was all over the place. That’s not appropriate. I don’t think that’s appropriate. And these are tough people. These are tough, strong people. I thought it looked terrible, to be honest with you.
Donald Trump: (55:31)
Now they made their decision. I didn’t make the decision. Secretary of Defense was involved and a lot of people were involved. I thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter? I mean, this isn’t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that’s nuclear powered, and he shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter. He could call and ask and suggest. But he stopped in Vietnam. A lot of people got off the boat. They came back and they had infection. And I thought it was inappropriate for the captain of a ship to do.
Speaker 16: (56:04)
Were you consulted about his removal?
Donald Trump: (56:05)
I don’t want to comment as to whether or not, but I agree with their decision 100%.
Donald Trump: (56:09)
In the back, please.
Speaker 17: (56:11)
Joe Biden actually just attacked you in a tweet. I don’t know if you have seen it.
Donald Trump: (56:16)
He just what?
Speaker 17: (56:17)
Attacked you. He just said-
Donald Trump: (56:17)
Oh, he didn’t write anything. Look, he has people, he has professionals from the Democrats writing.
Speaker 17: (56:21)
Mr. President, let me just read what he said. He said, “Donald Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus but he is responsible for failing to prepare our nation to respond to it.”
Speaker 17: (56:29)
How do you respond to that, sir?
Donald Trump: (56:32)
He didn’t write that. That was done by a Democrat operative. He doesn’t write. He’s probably not even watching right now. And if he is, he doesn’t understand what he’s watching. But just so you understand, it was very nice what they wrote. I don’t know. You know, they released it in a strange time. It’s sort of a strange time to release something like that. But he admitted I was right.
Donald Trump: (56:54)
And if you read the Federalist story, which most of you won’t because you don’t want to, but you’d learn something because it goes to a chart, times. I was early. Dr. Fauci, I don’t think he’s changed his mind, but he said it was a very important step when we stopped China from coming in from the specific area that was heavily infected. We’d have a whole different thing right now, so I don’t really know what Joe Biden said. I don’t really care.
Donald Trump: (57:21)
And again, I see every once in a while I’ll say something, I’ll make a speech and then it’ll be critiqued and I’ll get this beautiful, brilliant critique. Joe Biden didn’t write that. Joe Biden didn’t write that. He wished he did, but he didn’t.
Donald Trump: (57:35)
Go ahead. Please, back.
Speaker 18: (57:37)
Sure. I wanted to ask Dr. Fauci a quick question. China has warned at a resurgence of the virus. Has the U.S. developed a plan if in fact the second wave of the virus does, in fact, occur here in the country?
Dr. Fauci: (57:49)
Yes, we do. I mean, one of the things that obviously is parallel with thinking about the possibility, as I mentioned a little while ago, of mitigation allowing us to turn the corner, very much on the front burner, is what happens when we do, because the risk of there being a resurgent is real.
Dr. Fauci: (58:06)
So what we need to do, and I believe I said this before, but it’s worth repeating, that what we need to have in place, and we will have that in place, is that as you then pull back, you have to have the capability, in a very pristine, precise way, do the kind of containment when you do see it.
Dr. Fauci: (58:25)
Because, remember, when you get to mitigation, containment takes the back seat because you’re just struggling to mitigate. But when you get it down, you need to make sure it doesn’t resurge. That will require the ability to test, to identify, to isolate, and to do contact tracing. That’s what we have to have in place and hopefully we will at the time that we then pull back.
Speaker 19: (58:48)
Question for Dr. Hahn of the FDA. You mentioned the plasma, sir. So these are the plasma that people that were infected that have now either recovered or they’re doing well enough and then they’re transferring it to, is it family members? Can you walk us through? That’s working? Is it kind of like a case by case basis or hospitals? What are the results from that? I just was not familiar with that.
Dr. Hahn: (59:06)
So this is a situation where someone who’s recovered from the virus doesn’t have the virus in their system at all. You can take plasma, and this is a pretty routine procedure. You can actually donate a couple times a week, couple times a month, frankly, and give that plasma.
Dr. Hahn: (59:21)
That plasma contains the proteins in the blood that have the antibodies against the virus. You can take that, process it, and then give it to someone who’s ill. And so that allows you to transfer the immunity. Doesn’t have to be matched by family or anything like that.
Dr. Hahn: (59:35)
Since last Tuesday, the Tuesday before last, we’ve allowed academic centers and other laboratories and hospitals around the country to do this on a compassionate use basis. What we did was we pulled this together in what’s called an expanded access program and run it through the Red Cross because they’ve got the greatest system and capacity for doing this. And this allows us to scale up so that when people get sick, we can actually have these donated plasma packs given to the patients who are sick.
Speaker 19: (01:00:01)
So are people going to be donating plasma enough to meet. Obviously, some of us don’t know if we had it or in recovery. What should people be doing?
Dr. Hahn: (01:00:07)
So we’ve started with the Red Cross in this program. We made an announcement yesterday. We are planning to actually scale that up and we’ll have more information this week, because we want to make sure we have the systems in place. It’s a superb question.
Speaker 19: (01:00:19)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:00:20)
All right, Jeff, got it?
Speaker 20: (01:00:21)
Mr. President, can you clarify the situation with 3M right now? Germany said that it was an act of piracy that 200,000 masks were apparently diverted from Thailand to the United States instead of to Berlin. Is that a miscommunication? Did that actually happen? And should 3M be fulfilling contracts?
Donald Trump: (01:00:38)
We’re very disappointed in 3M. They should be taking care of our country, and they can sell to others, but they should be taking care of our country. The people that have dealt with them have dealt successfully with many companies over the last month. They don’t like the way 3M has treated our country. They don’t frankly like the representatives of 3M and no act of … You said piracy, right? Piracy?
Speaker 20: (01:01:06)
For German [crosstalk 01:01:05].
Donald Trump: (01:01:07)
There’s been no act of piracy. No, there’s been no act of piracy. It’s the opposite. 3M has not treated our country well, and if they do, great, and if they don’t, they’re going to have a hell of a price to pay.
Donald Trump: (01:01:18)
Okay. I say it that way, and I watched him on television on something talking about how this is so hard to believe, so hard to fathom. They ought to get their act together because I got involved and I looked at what happened and 3M has not treated our country well.
Speaker 20: (01:01:36)
Could you just clarify about that German order?
Donald Trump: (01:01:37)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 20: (01:01:39)
Was that diverted, sir, or what that not diverted?
Donald Trump: (01:01:40)
We’ll get you the information.
Speaker 21: (01:01:44)
I have a question for Dr. Fauci. I was wondering about what you’re seeing as far as lupus patients in regards to coronavirus. I know the President mentioned this earlier, but what does the medicine say?
Dr. Fauci: (01:01:54)
What is the question? Is that, what is the incidence of coronavirus-?
Speaker 21: (01:01:57)
Yeah. If you have lupus, do you have a greater chance of getting coronavirus?
Dr. Fauci: (01:01:59)
Yeah. Yeah. Right now this is being looked at in a natural history study. We don’t have any definitive information to be able to make any comment on that. It’s an obvious good question because it might be a way for us to get some interesting and potentially important data as to the role of those medications, but that’s something that is now being looked at, but we don’t have any data to be able to say anything definitively.
Donald Trump: (01:02:24)
And I hope they use the hydroxychloroquine, and they can also do it with Z-Pak subject to your doctor’s approval and all of that. But I hope they use it because, I’ll tell you what, what do you have to lose? In some cases they’re in bad shape. What do you have to lose? It’s been out there for a long time and I hope they use it and they’re going to look at the … With doctors, work with doctors, get what you have to get.
Donald Trump: (01:02:50)
But we have it stockpiled and we have a lot of it and we’re getting more of it. And as I told you, I spoke to Prime Minister Modi. We’re getting more of it, but we have a lot of it and I hope they use it because it’s been used for a long time and therefore it’s passed the safety test. FDA has been terrific. Dr Hahn, I appreciate it very much, too.
Donald Trump: (01:03:11)
But I’ve seen some results now. It’s early, I guess. It’s early, and they should look at the lupus thing. I don’t know what it says, but there’s a rumor out there that, because it takes care of lupus very effectively as I understand it. It’s a drug that’s used for lupus.
Donald Trump: (01:03:27)
So there’s a study out there that says people that have lupus haven’t been catching this virus. No. Maybe it’s true. Maybe it’s not. Why don’t you investigate that?
Donald Trump: (01:03:36)
And there’s also other studies with the malaria that the malaria countries have very little people that take this drug for malaria, which is very effective for malaria, that those countries have very little of this virus. I don’t know. You’re going to check it out. But I think people should … If it were me, in fact, I might do it anyway. I may take it. Okay. I may take it, and I’ll have to ask my doctors about that, but I may take it.
Donald Trump: (01:04:05)
Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 22: (01:04:06)
Mr. President, last week, the last couple days, you’ve been really optimistic about Russia and Saudi Arabia coming together on the deal on oil, but in the last 24 hours, the OPEC-Plus has been pushed back. They’ve traded some [crosstalk 01:04:18].
Donald Trump: (01:04:18)
OPEC can do whatever. Look, I’ve been against OPEC all my life because what is it? It’s an illegal, you could call it a cartel, you could call it a monopoly. You got a lot of different names for it, but it broke down very violently, very violently. So I don’t care about OPEC. I really don’t. I couldn’t care less about OPEC.
Speaker 22: (01:04:37)
[crosstalk 01:04:37].
Donald Trump: (01:04:37)
Let me just say it. No, no. I think they’re going to settle it. You know why? Because they’re going to be destroyed. They’re destroying themselves if they don’t. Russia, it’s a very important, and we had a very good conversation, President Putin and myself, very good, but Russia, a big part of their economic wellbeing is from oil. Well, oil is at a record low. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. It’s actually lower than you even think and it’s to their advantage. Obviously it’s to Saudi Arabia’s advantage.
Donald Trump: (01:05:06)
They told me they are discussing. Saudi Arabia went much further than that. He thinks that a deal is going to be made at 10 million barrels reduction and maybe more than that. He actually indicated it would most likely be much more than that.
Donald Trump: (01:05:21)
So we’ll see what happens. I mean we’re going to see what happens, but as far as OPEC is concerned, I was against OPEC for years and years be.
Donald Trump: (01:05:28)
cause I thought it was very unfair to our country. The beautiful thing is we have built one of the great … One of the things we’ve done is created so much we produce. We’re the number one producer in the world right now. I don’t like it for a different reason because it’s going to hurt a lot of jobs in our country, this price. It’s going to hurt a lot of jobs.
Donald Trump: (01:05:47)
Now, with all of that being said, people are going to be driving, paying 90 cents a gallon. Did you hear that? What’s that, 1952 or something? All right, so from that standpoint …
Donald Trump: (01:05:58)
But you know what? I am a big believer in our great energy business, and we’re going to take care of our energy business, and if I have to do tariffs on oil coming from outside, or if I have to do something to protect thousands and tens of thousands of energy workers and our great companies that produce all these jobs, I’ll do whatever I have to do. Okay?
Donald Trump: (01:06:18)
Yeah ma’am, go ahead. Yeah.
Speaker 23: (01:06:20)
You tweeted a little while ago about how sad it is for kids they don’t have Little League right now, but I’m wondering if you’re willing to share about your youngest son and how he’s dealing with life and sheltering in place, not going to school, no sports.
Donald Trump: (01:06:35)
Well, he’s a good athlete and he loves soccer and he’s like everyone else. Everything’s shut down. He’s in his room. He’s happy, but he’s not as happy as he could be. He’d like to be playing sports, Barron, and let’s see what happens.
Donald Trump: (01:06:53)
But we have to get back. We have to get back. Remember that. We have to get back and we have to get back soon. Okay.
Speaker 24: (01:07:00)
Mr. President, on the jobs reports numbers-
Donald Trump: (01:07:03)
You guys ever stop? You want to keep going for a little while, huh? I mean, do you ever stop? How many times you ask, and in many cases it’s the same. Actually, a lot of good questions. Go ahead, but keep going. Yes.
Speaker 24: (01:07:15)
Yes, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:07:15)
So you’re not going to blame me that I kept it going too long. People said, “Oh, he kept …” every time you’ll ask it. No, I mean, no, it’s amazing. Every hand went up. I thought we’ve gone through … I think every single hand went up the last time. You know what it shows you? It shows you that you love what you do. Go ahead.
Speaker 24: (01:07:33)
We do love what we do, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:07:34)
You do. No, you do, and some of you do it well. Not all of you. Go ahead. I’m not looking at you, by the way.
Speaker 24: (01:07:42)
So we didn’t get the jobs reports numbers yesterday. Obviously that’s kind of a small portion because it’s only the first half of March. Was there anything in there that was any sign of optimism? Obviously, we all saw the numbers down in retail, down in hospitality. Was there anything that … You said, “Okay, maybe with this virus we will see some sort of net gain in jobs”?
Donald Trump: (01:08:01)
Look, the job numbers are what they are. We asked everybody to go home, don’t work. So the numbers are going to be astronomical. We understand that. I understood that. I know somebody said the numbers are meaningless and then they took that to mean obs don’t mean anything. And it was just another fake news story.
Donald Trump: (01:08:22)
It wasn’t me that said it, by the way. It was a very smart person, but they meant it by saying it really is what … That’s why I answer your question very carefully. The numbers are what they are. We know the numbers were going to be massive because we told everybody to go home and lock your door essentially, right? Don’t come to work. You can’t come to work. Don’t go outside, don’t breathe, don’t do anything.
Donald Trump: (01:08:44)
We got to open up our country, but I know, I know that it’s coming back, and in my opinion, it will come back very strong. There’s a tremendous energy, there’s a tremendous demand and, some good things have happened. I don’t know.
Donald Trump: (01:08:59)
There’s one habit that, as you know, most of you, a lot of you have covered me a long time before I did this, I was never a big believer in shaking hands. But I decided if you don’t shake hands, you’re not going to be winning a lot of contests. Right now, I’m not sure you have to shake hands anymore. A couple of people have told me, Debra, you told me, that if we didn’t shake hands, the incidence of flu, flu is a big deal also, and that flu might be cut down in half. Who knew that shaking hands was such a bad thing?
Donald Trump: (01:09:28)
I felt it. I always felt it and I was never to a point where I can’t shake somebody’s hand. And I knew people like that, too, but there weren’t too many of them. But when I ran for office, all of a sudden I’m shaking hundreds of hands, and if I don’t, I wouldn’t even be standing here.
Donald Trump: (01:09:43)
But I think that’s a custom that maybe people don’t have to. We have to get close together. We have to sit together at the stadiums, we have to sit next to each other and wrestle. All that stuff is going to happen. But I think the concept of shaking hands may be something that’s going to be a little bit from the past. Let’s see what happens. Maybe they’ll go right back to shaking hands.
Speaker 24: (01:10:02)
My last question of the day. How about that?
Donald Trump: (01:10:03)
Good.
Speaker 24: (01:10:03)
Is there anything you want people to do to show their support, especially if we have two doctors up there, to show their support for the medical community? Is there something that we’ve seen people clapping when nurses leave. I’ve seen [crosstalk 01:10:14].
Donald Trump: (01:10:14)
Well, we’ve seen a lot of that yet. You might say something. I have seen such support. I saw this morning where everyone’s, they’re clapping for fire department, they’re clapping for peace, but they are really, these people are …
Donald Trump: (01:10:25)
You know what they’re like? Tony, they’re like warriors. Mike, they’re like warriors. They were going in Elmhurst hospital, which has been tragic. Right near where I grew up in Queens, going in. And the people in buildings, they’re going … They’re the rock stars. They’re warriors. Nurses, doctors, first responders, what they’re going through.
Donald Trump: (01:10:50)
And they don’t even know what’s going to happen. They go in and, by the way, even if they have great equipment, they’re catching it. They have good equipment, they catch it. They catch it with good, with bad. It is evil. But, Tony, you might say something, and, Mike, you may say something about that. Yeah.
Dr. Fauci: (01:11:06)
I’m glad you brought up that question because I don’t think people can really fully appreciate the extraordinary effort of these people. It’s amazing. I did all of my medical training in New York City in a big, busy New York City hospital at a time when it was just what you normally see in a hospital.
Dr. Fauci: (01:11:27)
I came to NIH and I spent about five to eight years in the very early years of the AIDS epidemic, which was just the darkest years of my life because almost every single one of my patients died. And yet, as we knew epidemiologically that there was very little risk, there was a small risk, but very little risk of getting infected from a patient to see now, with these brave warriors are doing in the hospitals, not only giving life saving treatment to people, but every single day putting themselves at risk for themselves and their family.
Dr. Fauci: (01:12:05)
I just think that the American public owe a phenomenal debt of gratitude for these people.
Speaker 24: (01:12:11)
How do you want them to show that?
Dr. Fauci: (01:12:12)
And they should just salute them at every, every ways you can. You know, when we were at war, at the height of the war in Afghanistan, in Iraq, when you’re at an airport and you’d see somebody with a uniform come by, everybody would do that. I think that’s what we should do when we see healthcare workers, just applaud them.
Donald Trump: (01:12:30)
Pretty much what’s happening. Mike? Please.
Vice President Pence: (01:12:38)
The stories are incredibly moving about what health care workers who are doing every day. It’s not just that they’re going back into the hospital. In places like New York, in New Jersey, earlier than that, and in Washington state and California where this first began. It’s not just that they’re providing care to people, but because of the nature of how contagious the coronavirus is, they’re also supplementing for family.
Vice President Pence: (01:13:11)
I mean, that’s what gets to me. When I hear the stories that understandably in nursing homes and in hospitals, they’re restricting visitors, and they should, to prevent the spread of the virus to be brought into the hospital or to be brought out. And so to hear the stories of health care workers who are holding up an iPhone while someone who’s critically ill with the coronavirus may well be saying their last goodbyes to their family, and then to be there in those moments.
Vice President Pence: (01:13:46)
Our healthcare workers are, they’re not just doctors and nurses today. They’re supplementing for family for people all across the country. And I just think, tomorrow’s Palm Sunday, it’s Holy week in the great Christian tradition, and I have people ask me from time to time, send me an email or on the many conference calls that we have, they said, “What can we be praying about?” And my first thought is with the families who have lost loved ones and the patients who are struggling with coronavirus.
Vice President Pence: (01:14:21)
But during this very special week, I just encourage people to pray for our healthcare workers. Pray for them and their families. They are really the hands and feet every day, not just of healthcare, but at the heart of the American people. And we are all grateful for them every hour of the day.
Donald Trump: (01:14:40)
Mike, thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:14:41)
And think also about the Army Corps of Engineers. It’s a little different depending on where are and where they’re working, but the Army Corps of Engineers throwing up a hospital in New York City, 2,500 beds in three days. I mean think of that.
Donald Trump: (01:14:56)
And FEMA, what they’re doing, and the National Guard is now delivering for the states because the states were unable to get, we’d drop it at a big warehouse where we’re told to drop it, and some of the states were unable to bring it from the warehouse to the site. So we got the National Guard to become a delivery service if you can believe it, and they would bring it. And some of those sites were dangerous sites. They were very dangerous sites. Think of that.
Donald Trump: (01:15:23)
It’s been amazing. It’s been amazing. I just think I’ve never seen anything like it. I’m so proud of this country. And really it’s a world problem, and some countries in the world are just handling it so well. You know, again, I keep saying it’s 151. That was as of two or three days ago. It’s probably more. Some people said they didn’t know there were that many countries. That’s how big this is.
Donald Trump: (01:15:46)
And Mike said something else. So the Palm Sunday, tomorrow, think of it, we’re not going to churches on Palm Sunday, but think of next Sunday, Easter. And I brought it up before. I said, ” Maybe we could allow special for churches. Maybe we could talk about it. Maybe we could allow them with great separation outside on Easter Sunday.” I don’t know. It’s something we we should talk about. But somebody did say that, well, then you’re sort of opening it up to that little, do we want to take a chance on doing that when we’ve been doing so well. But Easter Sunday, Palm Sunday, I’m going to be watching tomorrow live from Riverside, California, great church, but I’m going to be watching on a computer, right on a laptop. I think on Easter, maybe I’ll be watching from a laptop as opposed …
Donald Trump: (01:16:43)
So how sad is it that we have Easter Palm and Easter Sunday and people are watching on laptops and computers? It’s sad, but the job that this whole country has done is amazing.
Donald Trump: (01:16:59)
But I’ll say this. Our medical professionals, what they’ve done, because they walk into those hospitals, you see them putting on their gear and they’re putting it on as they’re walking through the front doors. And some of those people are going to die. They’re going to die. You know, it’s like incredible.
Donald Trump: (01:17:17)
And we can say what we want, Tony and Deb, about young and medium aged. Plenty of those people dying, too. You know, it generally hits the older people where they have problems. It hits young people, too, and it hits middle aged people, too.
Donald Trump: (01:17:34)
But these people are walking into hospitals and I watch. I think it’s incredible. And they’re putting their outfit, they’re getting into it, and they’re going in. They go in. It’s like a war.
Donald Trump: (01:17:49)
Again, there’s never been anything so contagious as this. In 1917, it was vicious if you got it, but it wasn’t contagious like this. Now in 1917, had they had the internet and all the means of communication, they could have practiced distancing. You know, by the time people started thinking in terms in those terms, they lost, I guess, 75 to 100 million people. So that’s modern day. Great thing that happened.
Donald Trump: (01:18:18)
Please.
Speaker 25: (01:18:20)
Yeah, just on antibodies. To what extent do you think that you can use antibody tests to determine who can go back to work and [inaudible 01:18:28].
Donald Trump: (01:18:29)
Well, I don’t know. I’d rather leave that to the doctor. Doctor, do you have an answer to that?
Dr. Hahn: (01:18:38)
We think it’ll be a tool.
Dr. Hahn: (01:18:39)
[crosstalk 01:18:34].
Dr. Hahn: (01:18:39)
We think it will be a tool to help us get people back to work. It’ll be additional information because, as you know, if you have an antibody, that means you are exposed and have recovered from it. That, with the information about diagnosis, should help.
Speaker 25: (01:18:50)
But how quickly can you scale up this testing to determine on a large scale how many people can go back to work that have these antibodies?
Dr. Hahn: (01:19:00)
So as you know, a couple of weeks ago we provided a great deal of regulatory flexibility around this. A lot of great developers have been working on this. Dr. Burkes put a call out to the academic labs around the country to do this, and we’ve been working very closely with a number of manufacturers, so we think that it can be scaled up relatively quickly.
Speaker 26: (01:19:19)
Mr. President, a question for Dr. Fauci. In a recent interview, you had said that you knew the 15 days guidance would not be enough. I wanted to ask your confidence level about the 30 day guidance and whether it will be enough.
Dr. Fauci: (01:19:37)
You know, it’s tough to talk about levels of confidence, but I can tell you one thing that I feel strongly, that if we do in a very proactive way what I said in my opening comments and people literally across the country as a baseline have that physical separation, and as we’ve mentioned up here, there’ll be varying degrees of that depending upon whether you’re in New York City or you’re in a place that’s less, but every place, everybody should be doing some degree of this physical separation.
Dr. Fauci: (01:20:08)
If we do that, again, I have confidence that what we will see is the turning around of the curve, whether or not it will be all the way down to what we want, it’s impossible to say. I would be foolish to say that, but the one thing I am confident in, so let’s take this to the bank, that mitigation works. It does. We’ve seen it in other countries. We’ve seen it in our own country, and that’s the reason why I keep coming up at every chance I get to plea with the American people to please take a look at those guidelines that the Vice President keeps putting up with his chart. Because every single one of those points has something to do with physical separation.
Donald Trump: (01:20:46)
And mitigation does work. But, again, we’re not going to destroy our country. We have to get back because at a certain point, you’ll lose more people this way, through all of the problems caused, than you will-
Donald Trump: (01:21:03)
This way through all of the problems caused, then you will with what we’re doing right now… What we’re doing right now, I think it’s going to be very successful. But you know what? I don’t know. We have a big decision to make at a certain point. Okay? We have a big decision to make. We went this extra period of time, but I said it from the beginning. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and we cannot let that happen. We have an incredible country. We were having the greatest period in our country’s history from an economic standpoint in many other ways. We cannot let this continue. So at a certain point some hard decisions are going to have to be made. Go ahead.
Jeff: (01:21:44)
Mr. President, ventilator manufacturers are doubling, tripling, even quadrupling their production in some cases.
Donald Trump: (01:21:49)
That’s true.
Jeff: (01:21:50)
Yet, medical experts and some of these manufacturers are predicting that there will still be shortages of tens of thousands of ventilators. Is it time for you to level with the American public that there likely will be shortages of ventilators in some cases?
Donald Trump: (01:22:05)
Could be. I mean, it could be you have shortages, and it could also be that you have some that have way overestimated the number of ventilators they need. We think that we have a good amount ready to move. I mean, literally, like an army, they’re ready to move to any hotspot. But some of the ones that you’re talking about, always a nasty question from CNN.
Jeff: (01:22:27)
Why is that a nasty question?
Donald Trump: (01:22:29)
Because I think that frankly [crosstalk 01:22:31] because you know what you’ve asked that question about 10 times over the course of about a month. Look, we’re mobilized and ready to go. We have a lot of ventilators ready to go, and if we had given them all out, we wouldn’t, and you would be overstocked in many areas. What we’re doing is we have a very good plan to take from some areas. Even though we have the 10 or almost the 10,000, we’re also taking from areas that won’t be as badly hit as today we think they will be. There will be some areas hit harder than we think, and there’s nothing that Deborah or Tony or any of these professionals can do about it.
Donald Trump: (01:23:08)
This thing moves in a lot of ways, but what we’re going to do is we are going to have, and you look at us compared to a lot of other countries, we’re in much better shape. But these professionals have done an amazing job. Now, over the next week and two weeks, it’s going to be a very, very deadly period, unfortunately. But we’re going to make it so that we lose as few lives as possible, and I think we’re going to be successful. I think we already are successful in that regard. When you look at that graph and you see all of the bumps, if you want to call it, at a very low level, and you see a couple at a higher level, they were tough, but you see all of those levels.
Donald Trump: (01:23:50)
You know when you look at and when you hear about Italy and then you hear about France and then you hear about… What we have is we have many Italy’s all over. They’re like countries. California is a country, New York is a country. If you look at them from the standpoint of what we’re talking about. We have many like country spots. Some are hotspots, and there’s nothing we’re going to do about it. One of the biggest surprises is Louisiana because it started off so good, and then all of a sudden it shot up like a rocket, but we are going to try and have ventilators wherever we possibly can. Jeff, go ahead.
Jeff: (01:24:25)
Herculean effort of some of these companies to ramp up production as fast as possible.
Donald Trump: (01:24:29)
Sure.
Jeff: (01:24:29)
It still won’t be enough.
Donald Trump: (01:24:30)
Well, New York wanted 40,000 ventilators. Okay, 40,000. Think of what 40,000 is? It’s like cars. It’s a big project. It’s an expensive product. I mean, some of them a $50,000 a piece. I saw one the other day, 55,000, that was before they start playing the games with supply and demand okay? Some are very, very, you call them luxury. Some are not. But frankly these are very expensive products. These are very high tech projects and products, and they take a period of time.
Donald Trump: (01:25:00)
We have thousands of them being built right now. Some will be ready, and we’re going to have extra, and we’ll keep them at hospitals. But a lot of hospitals, a lot of states had the chance of getting ventilators, and they turned those ventilators down so they could spend their money at something else. In a way I understand that, because who thinks a thing like this? It’s not a knock. If I’m told, perhaps in New York, you can spend one billion dollars on ventilators and get 16,000 or a massive number of ventilators that they’ve been offered over the years. Or you can build a new bridge or road or something. I mean, I understand how that works. I’m not blaming anybody. I’m just saying a lot of the States had chances of stockpiling a lot of ventilators. They didn’t do it, and I think we’re doing a very good job in helping them out place. Please, Jeff. It’s a very fair question. I understand that question very well. Yeah.
Jeff: (01:25:53)
Follow up on what you and the others have been saying today about it being a deadly week or two coming. Can you give us a sense of perhaps [inaudible 01:26:01] of what that means numerically?
Donald Trump: (01:26:02)
I’d like to ask also, yeah. I’d like to say we know pretty much the line of attack. We know the numbers. The numbers are the numbers. They seem to be checking out, unfortunately. Or in some cases they’re on the low side, which we’re very happy. We want to keep them on the very low side, and that’s where we’re headed. I think that’s maybe where we’re headed. But I’d like to ask maybe you and Tony, where is the week or the number of days of greatest attack? What will be our worst day, if that’s possible to determine? I think that’s what you’re asking, right?
Jeff: (01:26:37)
How many deaths exactly are you expecting?
Dr. Birx: (01:26:40)
So as you can look and the places that are the most difficult hit right now: the Detroit area, the New York area, the Louisiana area. We are doing it by the counties in those States because mostly it’s Metro areas and the bedroom communities around those Metro areas. Because people went to work and got exposed and came home and exposed other. If you look out in New York now you see that it’s in Long Island and is out in Suffolk County and Nassau County. All of those counties, Wayne and Oakland, they’re all on the upside of their curve of mortality. So you know when you get to the peak you come down the other side.
Jeff: (01:27:26)
When will that peak be?
Dr. Birx: (01:27:27)
So by the predictions that are in that healthdata.org, they are predicting in those three hotspots, all of them hitting together in the next six to seven days.
Jeff: (01:27:41)
Are you thinking tens of thousands of deaths in that period of time?
Dr. Birx: (01:27:47)
You can go to the website. It’s variable. Each one of those communities is different. But you know where New York is, how much their mortality has been, and you know what we’re seeing today are the people who were infected two or three weeks ago. If mitigation in New York worked and we believe it is working, the cases are going to start to go down, but the mortality will be a lag behind that. Because of the comorbidities and other conditions. So that’s why all of the predictions are that this next week, and I think we said this last Sunday when we talked about the charts, and it’s difficult. We tried to prepare the American people to understand that as much as you go up, you have to come down the other side because coming down as a reflection of the cases that were coming in before.
Jeff: (01:28:46)
[inaudible 01:28:46] number?
Dr. Birx: (01:28:46)
I’d rather not say a number, but the numbers are available if you go to the website. I mean, you can see that there’s several hundreds per day in New York, and I think Governor Como has talked about that increasing still into the five, six, 700 range a day. So that’s very concerning to us. We again applaud the healthcare workers who are doing every single thing humanly possible to save more lives, and we are ensuring on a ventilator by ventilator day by day to get them there so that we can say, and we can be there when they need it. Because we are supposed to be that group that comes in after all of the resources are exhausted, and we really applaud what Oregon did, and we really applaud what the governor is doing about moving between the states, between the different counties to bring them to New York because that’s what’s needed today. A different place will be needed tomorrow.
Jeff: (01:29:53)
You mentioned, just to follow up on something that apparently you said yesterday that you had some concerns about Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Washington DC. Could you expand on that?
Dr. Birx: (01:30:00)
We’re watching them because they are starting to go on that upside of the curve. We’re hoping and believing that if people mitigate strongly, the work that they did over the last two weeks will blunt that curve, and they won’t have the same upward slope and peak that New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and part of Rhode Island are having. So the next two weeks are extraordinarily important, and that’s why I think you’ve heard from Dr. Fauci, from myself, from the President and the Vice President, that this is the moment to do everything that you can on the presidential guidelines. This is the moment to not be going to the grocery store and not going to the pharmacy, but doing everything you can to keep your family and your friends safe. That means everybody doing the six feet distancing, washing your hands.
Donald Trump: (01:30:56)
Go ahead. [inaudible 01:30:57].
Dr. Fauci: (01:30:57)
So, I mean ditto to everything that Dr. Birx said, but also to emphasize why it’s so important to do that because we’re looking at three or four really key hotspots that are still going up. It’s absolutely essential that the ones that are down at that lower level that Dr. Burke showed the other day, those communities where they’re still going up, we’ve got to make sure we don’t have multiple waves of peaks. That’s going to be the answer to the question of when we can start pulling back because if you keep having multiple peaks and different waves, that’s going to make it very difficult.
Jeff: (01:31:36)
[inaudible 01:31:36] Exactly what I said just before, and I keep repeating. Just make sure everybody does at least the minimal amount of that physical separation because the virus has no place to go if you’re physically separated.
Donald Trump: (01:31:52)
One of the reasons that I keep talking about hydroxychloroquine is that the question that nobody ever asks, and the question that I most hate the answer to is what happens if you do have a ventilator? What are your chances? I just hope that hydroxychloroquine wins. Coupled with perhaps the Z pack, as we call it, dependent totally on your doctors, and the doctors there.
Donald Trump: (01:32:27)
Because you know the answer to that question. If you do have the ventilator, you know the answer to that question. I hate giving the answer, so I don’t want to get them there. I don’t want to get them there. There’s a possibility, a possibility, and I say it. What do you have to lose? I’ll say it again. What do you have to lose? Take it. I really think they should take it, but it’s their choice, and it’s their doctor’s choice or the doctors in the hospital. But hydroxychloroquine. Try it, if you’d like.
Donald Trump: (01:33:04)
The other thing, if you have a heart condition, I understand probably you stay away from the Z pack. But that’s an antibiotic. It can clean out the lungs. The lungs are a point of attack for this horrible virus. But when you have a ventilator, don’t ask the answer because I hate it if you have it and it’s working beautifully. I don’t like the answer because it’s not a very high percentage. So I want to keep them out of ventilators. If this drug works, it will be, not a game changer, because that’s not a nice enough term. It will be wonderful. It’ll be so beautiful. It’ll be a gift from heaven if it works. Because when people go into those ventilators, you know the answers. I know the answers, and I’m glad you don’t write about it. Mike, please.
Vice President Pence: (01:34:07)
Well, you’ve heard from the experts what our task force has heard. It’s going to be a difficult week for the American people. You will see testing increased around the country and so cases are going to continue to rise across America. Before I give a few facts relevant to an earlier question about ventilators, let me add my voice to what the President just said and what all the physicians who’ve spoken has said. Even though we see the losses rising in the days ahead, do not be discouraged because there is evidence across the country that Americans have been putting the social distancing and mitigation into practice, and it is making a difference. We are seeing it in the new cases that are being reported.
Vice President Pence: (01:35:03)
Because remember, families that experience loss up to this day and in in the next week have a loved one who contracted the coronavirus in most cases more than two weeks ago. In many cases before social distancing and mitigation efforts were put into effect. So we want to encourage you, believe in the President’s coronavirus guidelines for America. Go to coronavirus.gov. Print them off again. Put them on the refrigerator and remind yourself to put them into practice.
Vice President Pence: (01:35:44)
On the subject of ventilators, if I can amplify the point the President made, our team at FEMA is doing a remarkable job working with governors, state health officials and local hospitals, particularly focused on our priority areas. We will refer to the New York Metro area, which includes New Jersey and Connecticut. We’re focused on the New Orleans Metro area in Louisiana. We’re focusing on Detroit. We’re focusing on Chicago. These are the areas where we see the significant rise in cases, and we are surging supplies, specifically ventilators, but all personal protective equipment from FEMA to those areas.
Vice President Pence: (01:36:33)
Just to give you a couple of examples, I spoke to governors in New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Maryland today, alone. In those cases, Governor Cuomo is actually assessing all of the available ventilators. We’ve sent 4,400 ventilators already to New York. As has already been referenced, they’re going to receive a shipment of over a thousand from overseas. Allow me to say, as I told her personally today, the governor of Oregon, Governor Kate Brown, her unilateral decision to send 140 ventilators because they felt Oregon today is in a place where they could give those ventilators to New York. To me, it was in the very highest American tradition of loving your neighbor. When I talked to Governor Cuomo, Mr. President, he actually told me they never asked Oregon for the ventilators and Governor Brown hadn’t even called him to tell him that she was doing that.
Vice President Pence: (01:37:34)
It really is remarkable. When I talked to Governor Hogan today and President and I will be speaking to all of America’s governors on Monday again. I told him how inspired I was and how he ought to spread the word to other governors in areas where they can spare resources to be joining with us at the federal level and providing them to states at the point of the need.
Vice President Pence: (01:37:55)
But just a few for instances. As we track New Jersey, as I told Governor Phil Murphy, we deployed 200 ventilators to New Jersey today. Louisiana, where we’re monitoring literally hour by hour what’s taking place in New Orleans with some encouraging news, but still great challenges. Yesterday you heard the President say that we deployed 330,000 gowns that had been delivered to the public health systems and hospitals there. 200 ventilators.
Vice President Pence: (01:38:25)
I spoke to governor Charlie Baker today and was able to inform him. We’re watching Boston area very closely. 100 ventilators are deploying today. I spoke to Governor Gretchen Whitmer today. Detroit is experiencing a significant number of cases. We’re watching it carefully. Today FEMA directed 300 of ventilators to Michigan. Again, as the President said, we’re all working our hearts out. But what I want to say to American families and what I want to say to healthcare workers is that we are going to identify the resources, leave no stone unturned, and we are going to focus resources on those areas in the order that they emerge.
Vice President Pence: (01:39:15)
Now, the last thought is back on mitigation. We are hoping that we do not see other major cities in the country experience what Seattle experienced, what greater New York city area’s experiencing, what New Orleans is experiencing. That’s all in the hands of the American people today. So I just want to encourage you, coronavirus.gov. Put into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines, and you will do your part to save lives, protect the American people, and ensure that we will have the resources to meet this moment wherever the need should arise.
Speaker 27: (01:39:55)
Mr. President, do you [inaudible 01:39:55] loan program that got up and running yesterday. We’re hearing from a lot of small business owners, a lot of concerns about whether they will get this money. Some of the banks weren’t ready yesterday to start processing loans. Some banks are [crosstalk 01:40:11].
Donald Trump: (01:40:10)
We’re way ahead of schedules. The banks have been great. JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, they are so far ahead. This is typical with you in particular. We hear their behind. They’re not behind. It been flawless so far, far beyond our expectations. You should say, I hear you’re doing well, but maybe… I don’t even hear of any glitch. They’ve done billions of dollars of loans to small business. These are great loans. These are loans that get immediately paid off. These are loans that get businesses back. I wish you could ask a question where something’s working so well. Now maybe things won’t work well, and I don’t mind that kind. But when something’s working so well and you ask a question in such a negative way. It’s doing great. Yeah, go ahead. [crosstalk 01:41:01]. It’s doing great. Really good. Maybe it won’t in two weeks, and I’ll respond differently, but it’s doing great. You know it and so does everyone else. Everyone’s shocked how well it’s doing.
Donald Trump: (01:41:12)
[crosstalk 01:41:12] Who did?
Speaker 28: (01:41:13)
Dr. Burns.
Donald Trump: (01:41:13)
Yes.
Speaker 28: (01:41:14)
Some demographics, such as seeing that men might be more susceptible to the virus. Seeing in Europe more cases among the between 30 and 50 class. Has the data that you’ve seen in the past two weeks changed that assessment? Are men more susceptible? [crosstalk 01:41:35].
Donald Trump: (01:41:34)
I don’t think it’s changed much, has it?
Dr. Birx: (01:41:36)
The same pattern as Europe.
Donald Trump: (01:41:38)
Same pattern. Same answer that we’ve given you for the last month.
Speaker 28: (01:41:43)
[crosstalk 01:41:43] between 30 and 50 being more adversely affected than we’ve seen in Asia.
Dr. Birx: (01:41:50)
No. Tomorrow, I’ll bring you all the graphs back so you can see it.
Donald Trump: (01:41:54)
We can bring an updated graph, but it’s very similar. Please.
Speaker 29: (01:41:57)
Mr. President, a few days ago you talked about possibly restricting flights from hotspots. Where are you on that? [crosstalk 01:42:03].
Donald Trump: (01:42:03)
We’re looking at it very seriously. Right now we’re dealing with governors, we’re dealing with airlines, we’re dealing with a lot of different factors. It’s a very difficult decision. We’re also doing testing, getting into planes, very strong testing. States are doing testing of people that leave planes because they don’t want to have people coming in who are infected. So understanding that and the level of testing has been enormous. Okay? Some states are saying you have to go in quarantine for two weeks if you come from certain areas. So knowing that, we’re working with the governors.
Speaker 30: (01:42:37)
Mr. President, when you say testing, you mean domestic travel or people coming in [crosstalk 00:21:42].
Donald Trump: (01:42:42)
Both. Some states are doing when they land, they are doing very strong, very powerful testing. Please go ahead.
Speaker 31: (01:42:47)
Some airlines, sir, and they say, they don’t know what you’re talking about.
Donald Trump: (01:42:49)
Okay, well, then you’ll check up again.
Speaker 32: (01:42:51)
One last question on ventilators.
Donald Trump: (01:42:53)
Governments are doing it too. Our government.go ahead.
Speaker 32: (01:42:55)
One last question on ventilators. The governor of New York said that he received donation in ventilators from Jack Ma of Alibaba, which I think is your friend. Would you call on the business community to donate ventilators? Not necessarily to New York, but other states like Louisiana [crosstalk 00:22:11].
Donald Trump: (01:43:11)
Know Jack Ma, is a friend of mine. He’s made it very possible to get about a thousand ventilators from China. But that was from him and my other friend. That was really a gift, and we appreciate it very much. It was very nice of them. All right. I think we’ve had enough. We’ll be seeing you very soon, and I’m sure that you know that all of us are going to be working very hard. We’re working very hard. We are really coming up into a time that’s going to be very horrendous. Probably a time like we haven’t seen in this country, wouldn’t you say? I mean, I don’t think we’ve seen a time like this in the country, and we’re getting to that point where it’s going to really be a some very bad numbers. We want to keep those numbers a lot lower than they would have been, and we will do that.
Donald Trump: (01:43:58)
We have tremendous talent working. We have tremendous people, and that includes governors. That includes everybody. Everybody’s working, but unfortunately we’re getting to that time when the numbers are going to peak, and it’s not going to be a good looking situation. I really believe we probably have never seen anything like these kinds of numbers. Maybe during the war, during a world war one or two or something. But this is a war all in to itself, and it’s a terrible thing. We will be seeing you soon. We’ll keep you totally abreast. We’re also going to be releasing new ventilator numbers because we have a lot of them coming, and a lot of them going to different locations, and we appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 33: (01:44:53)
On the [inaudible 01:44:53] backlog. [inaudible 01:44:53] quick question, are we in that 24 hour window-"
"Apr 3, 2020",12:55 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
With Kevin McCarthy, future speaker of the house, I hope. And he’s done a fantastic job for the people of California. And also the people of California have done a fantastic job, when you take a look at the bump, and how they’re doing out there. I congratulate everybody out there, but I thought I’d have Kevin say a few words. So Kevin, please.
Kevin McCarthy: (00:27)
Well thank you Mr. President and I would like to thank you. I’m [inaudible 00:00:36]. Governor Newsom says the work that you’re doing together, you’ve been working very closely, has been effective in California. As well, Vice President and the President. You know today, Mr. President, I want to thank you, especially, for the work as Secretary Mnuchin has done especially for small businesses. Just today alone, I saw Bank of America had more than 10,000 loans in two hours. For anybody who’s in small business, my first small business when I was 20 years old, you don’t have income coming in right now. You get a loan. But for your rent, paying your employees, and paying your utilities is a grant. That’s part of the Cares Act. And I think you’re going to find that a lot of small businesses are going to hire people back, keep them afloat through the next two months and get this economy moving again as we get through this virus. So I just want to thank you for all that.
Donald Trump: (01:20)
Great job you’re doing. Thank you.
Kevin McCarthy: (01:22)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:22)
You go ahead. I’ll talk to you later.
Kevin McCarthy: (01:24)
All right.
Donald Trump: (01:28)
Okay. Thank you very much everybody. And I want to start by saying that our hearts go out to the people of New York as they bear the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic in America. That seems to be the hotspot right now. But you have some others as you know, that are very bad, very bad. Louisiana is getting hit very hard. Parts of Michigan are getting hit very, very hard. New Jersey is surprisingly, it’s much greater than anybody would have thought. They’re doing a really good job. Governor is doing a really good job out there.
Donald Trump: (02:03)
New York’s first responders, EMTs, doctors, nurses are showing incredible courage under pressure. They’re the best in the world. We will take every action and we’ll spare no resource, financial, medical, scientific, we will not spare anything. We’ll get it back into shape. The Empire State, the governor’s doing an excellent job. They’re all working very hard together. At the request of the Governor, as you know, the Javits Center… We have 2,500 beds and we’re going to allow that to be a system where this horrible disease can be looked after. The patients can be looked after. That was going to be for regular medical problems such as accidents. It’s very interesting, the Governor is telling me, “We don’t have too many accidents, very few people driving.” So we’re going to put that facility into play, which is a big facility. The ship will be staying the way it is, but we’re putting that facility into play to help them.
Donald Trump: (03:12)
And today also the CDC is announcing additional steps Americans can take to defend against the transmission of the virus. From recent studies we know that the transmission from individuals without symptoms is playing a more significant role in the spread of the virus than previously understood. So, you don’t seem to have symptoms and it still gets transferred. In light of these studies, the CDC is advising the use of nonmedical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it’s voluntary, you don’t have to do. They suggested for a period of time, but this is voluntary.
Donald Trump: (03:55)
I don’t think I’m going to be doing it, but you have a lot of ways you can look at it as follows. The CDC is recommending that Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mask that can be either purchased online or simply made at home, probably material that you’d have at home. These face coverings can be easily washed or reused. I want to emphasize that the CDC is not recommending the use of medical grade or surgical grade masks, and we want that to be used for our great medical people that are working so hard and doing some job. Medical protective gear must be reserved for the frontline healthcare workers who are performing those vital services. The new mask guidelines also do not replace CDC’s guidance on social distancing, including staying in your home when possible, standing at least six feet apart for a period of time. Again, we’re going to all come back together here. We’re going all come back together. And, practicing hand hygiene, which we should do anyway.
Donald Trump: (04:59)
A lot of things I think are going to spill over. Shaking hands, maybe, will stay with our country for a long time beyond this. One of our great doctors was telling me that, as you know, we have flus every year and the number of people killed by the flu is very substantial. He said that if they didn’t shake hands, that number would be substantially lower. So maybe some of these things, longterm, will be good. But those guidelines are still the best and the safest way to avoid the infection.
Donald Trump: (05:36)
So with the masks it’s going to be, really, a voluntary thing. You can do it, you don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it, but some people may want to do it and that’s okay. It may be good, probably will. They’re making a recommendation. It’s only a recommendation, it’s voluntary.
Donald Trump: (05:54)
We’ve also taken action to ensure no barrier to any American seeking testing or treatment of the coronavirus. The largest insurer nationwide, the Blue Cross Blue Shield system, has now announced that it will not require any copays, which is really something, that’s a tremendous statement, from patients of the virus treatment for the next 60 days. Similar to the commitments of Cigna, Humana, Anthem. Those are great companies and they’re all doing the same thing. So copays, for them to do that is a big statement. We appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (06:33)
Today I can so proudly announce that hospitals and healthcare providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government using funds from the Economic Relief Package congress passed last month. That was as per the question yesterday, and actually the day before yesterday. This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment. So that, I think, answers the question pretty well and very much in the favor of our great people.
Donald Trump: (07:10)
I’m also signing a directive invoking the Defense Production Act to prohibit export of scarce health and medical supplies by unscrupulous actors and profiteers. The Secretary of Homeland Security will work with FEMA to prevent the export of N95 respirators, surgical masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment. We need these items immediately for domestic use, we have to have them. But we’ve done really well with the purchase of items and you’ll be hearing about that shortly.
Donald Trump: (07:48)
We’ve already leveraged the DPA to stop the hoarding and price gouging of crucial supplies. Under that authority, this week the Department of Health and Human Services working with the Department of Justice took custody of nearly 200,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks, 600,000 gloves. As well as bottles, many, many, many bottles and disinfectant sprays that were being hoarded. All of this material is now being given to healthcare workers, most of it’s already been given out. And we’ve given a lot to New York, a lot to New Jersey, a lot to other places.
Donald Trump: (08:29)
In addition, to ensure that health care workers in New York have the protective equipment they need, the federal government in the name of the Department of Defense is providing about 8.1 million N95 respirators, Department of Defense. And we’ve already given 200,000 of them to New York City. Mayor De Blasio needed them very badly, so we got them to Mayor De Blasio in New York City and they were very grateful. 8.1 million, and we’re going to be increasing that number from 8.1 million to more. That’s a lot of N95 respirators.
Donald Trump: (09:11)
Today my team spoke with the CEO of Oschner Health and the CEO of LCMC, the two largest health systems in New Orleans. They said they feel that they currently have enough ventilators. I think a lot of people are going to have enough ventilators, and masks, and appreciate what we did and all of the things we’ve been doing with them, working with them. The CEO of Oschner, Warner Thomas, who’s really been fantastic I have to say, indicated a need for 230,000 surgical gowns and I instructed FEMA to deliver them tomorrow. That’s Louisiana, New Orleans. 230,000 surgical gowns, they’ll have them by tomorrow. We’re expanding the role of the armed forces in our response effort because no one is better prepared to win a war than the United States military. And we are in a war, the invisible enemy, remember. Over 9,000 retired Army medical personnel have answered their nation’s call and are now supporting field hospitals and medical facilities all across the country. Like what I just told you, that Governor Cuomo requested we do something in Javits where we’ve taken over. And we’re going to have that manned by the military, because it’s very tough to get more people in the New York area. So we’re going to have it manned by the military, Javits Center.
Donald Trump: (10:44)
National Guard members have been activated to help States build new treatment centers and assist in the seamless distribution of medical supplies. That includes National Guard. The National Guard is assisting very strongly because the States were, in many cases, unable to have the delivery capability from warehouses and other places that we put the supplies. So I’ve given approval to use the National Guard, the various National Guards in the different States. And they’re doing a fantastic job of not only protecting people, but delivering material.
Donald Trump: (11:23)
The Army Corps of Engineers has assessed more than 100 facilities in all 50 States and is rapidly building temporary hospitals and alternative care sites in many States. In New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, Ohio. They’re doing a lot of work in just those States, plus additionals that will be announced probably tomorrow, but they’re doing some job. The Army Corps of Engineers, what a job they’re doing. And FEMA, what a job they’re doing.
Donald Trump: (12:01)
As we deploy the power of our military, we’re also deploying the skill of our doctors, scientists, and medical researchers. We continue to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and other therapies in the treatment and prevention of the virus. We will keep the American people fully informed in our findings. Hydroxychloroquine, I don’t know, it’s looking like it’s having some good results. I hope that, that would be a phenomenal thing. But we have it right now in, approximately, it’s increased to 1,500 people. I spoke with Dr. Zucker in New York, terrific guy by the way, he’s doing a good job. And I spoke to Governor Cuomo last evening and this morning about it. It’s been there for about three and a half days and many other places it’s being tested, too. And we have a tremendous supply of it. We’ve ordered it in the case that it works, and it could have some pretty big impacts. We’ll see what happens.
Donald Trump: (13:07)
My administration is also working to get relief to American workers and businesses. In day one of the Paycheck Protection Program, as Kevin said, more than $3.5 billion in guaranteed loans have been processed to help small businesses keep their workers employed during this unprecedented time. Bank of America has been incredible. Of the big banks, Bank of America has really stepped forward and done a great job. And then you have the community banks, your smaller banks, and we’re already at three point $5 billion going out to incredible people. But that’s way ahead of schedule.
Donald Trump: (13:47)
The SBA and the treasury are working around the clock. And our banking partners are really incredible, and they’re ensuring that the money gets to small businesses as quickly as possible. And then the small business, in turn, take care of employees that they would have had to let go. And now they’ll keep them, and that’s good. Then they’re going to open for business and they’re going to have their employees, and we’ll try and get back to where we were. Eventually, we’re going to supersede where we were.
Donald Trump: (14:15)
The energy industry has been especially hard hit in the crisis. This afternoon I met with Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hagar of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicky Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of ExxonMobil. I informed them that we will be making space available in the strategic petroleum reserve to let American producers store surplus oil that can be sold at a later time. There’s a tremendous abundance of oil, primarily because of the virus. The virus has just stopped demand of everything, including oil. So we’re working with our great energy companies. These are great companies. They employee tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people. They’ve kept America really going for a long time, and no big price hikes, no big anything. I mean, they’ve just kept it going and now they got hit. But with all the jobs and all of the good that they do, we’re going to make sure that they stay in good shape.
Donald Trump: (15:35)
America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens, our future society. Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy for a long time. We want them to stay healthy for a long time, so stay at home. This is ending, this will end. You’ll see some bad things, and then you’re going to see some really good things and it’s not going to be too long.
Donald Trump: (16:04)
We will heal our citizens, and we will care for our neighbors, and we will unleash the full might of the United States of America to vanquish the virus. And with that I’d like to ask Mike Pence to come up. Vice-President, say a few words. And we’ll have a couple of other quick talks on a couple of subjects, and we’ll take questions.
Donald Trump: (16:26)
It’s a beautiful Friday in Washington, D.C. and our country’s a great place. And we’re getting better, we’re getting better very quickly. This was artificially induced, they said, “Close it down, you have to close it down.” We closed it down and we’re healing, and we’re going to get it better fast. So Mike, if you could come up and say a few words, please.
Mike Pence: (16:52)
Thank you., Mr. President. The President just outlined a number of the decisions that he made today on the unanimous recommendation of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. In addition, some good news Dr. Deborah Birx will reflect on in a moment, on some of the areas across America where we see evidence that the mitigation efforts, the American people putting into practice the President’s coronavirus guidelines are having a positive effect. In fact today, California and Washington State where the coronavirus first emerged in our country, the cases remain at a steady but low rate. We know, as Governor Newsom said yesterday, that they’re not out of the woods yet. We continue to flow resources. But we want to commend people in those States and all across the country who are putting into practice the social distancing, and all the measures that State and local leaders are advising, and that the President has been advising in the coronavirus guidelines for America.
Mike Pence: (17:59)
We’re also continuing to track significant outbreaks in New York State, New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, and Boston. And as the President indicated, we’re prioritizing resources to support health care workers and to support those that are dealing with the coronavirus in those communities.
Mike Pence: (18:16)
On the subject of testing, now more than 1.4 million tests have been performed across the country. And as you all are aware, some 266,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus. Abbott Instruments, which now can perform a 15 minute test across the country, have literally 18,000 of their machines across the nation today. But at the President’s direction, FEMA is acquiring over 1200 more machines to distribute to every State public health lab in America and also to our Indian Healthcare and Service.
Mike Pence: (18:56)
And the big news, of course, over the last few days was that the FDA, once again in near record time, has approved an antibody. A test developed by SELEX. And we’re continuing on the White House Coronavirus Task Force to examine ways that we can scale up these rapid tests, and these innovative new tests. Not just to meet this moment, but to lay a foundation for testing across the nation in the months ahead.
Mike Pence: (19:22)
As President mentioned, he met with energy executives today and continues to engage with leaders of businesses all across the nation. We also held a teleconference today with commercial retailers. On the President’s behalf we thanked them for the way that people that operate malls and shopping centers around the country have embraced and enacted the coronavirus guidelines for America. It’s had enormous impact on their businesses and their industries. But I heard from them their patriotic commitment with the health of their associates and their customers first. And it was deeply-
Mike Pence: (20:03)
Put the health of their associates and their customers first and it was deeply inspiring. On the subject of supplies, the president detailed our work in that space. It continues to this day. Part of our air bridge, we had a flight arrive from China today to Columbus, Ohio. We continue to work each and every day watching the data about cases to ensure that in particular, not just the personal protective equipment is available for the healthcare workers that are on the front lines, but also that ventilators are available as this epidemic makes its way through regions and communities. We are literally working hour by hour, day by day, to make sure that patients, families and healthcare providers have the equipment and the support that they need.
Mike Pence: (20:50)
As the president mentioned, we’ve seen over a billion and a half dollars in loans go out through the paycheck protection program today. We have available for questions the head of the CDC today to speak about the new guidance on cloth face coverings and Secretary Azar, in a few moments, will explain just how the president’s decision to make sure that no American will ever have to worry about paying for testing or for coronavirus treatment.
Mike Pence: (21:22)
I’m pleased to report that the president’s direction, Medicaid and Medicare already expanded to coronavirus treatment and testing early on. Of course the president just indicated how major insurance companies across the country are not just waiving copays on testing, but they’re now waiving copays for at least 60 days on any coronavirus treatment. Now Secretary Azar will enumerate on how we’ll make sure that any American, even those that have no insurance, will be able to receive treatment in a hospital and never have to worry about the bill.
Mike Pence: (21:57)
I just give a gentle reminder to every American that there is evidence across the country that you’re putting into practice the coronavirus guidelines for America. Every American has a role to play and I want to thank you on behalf of the president and all of the American people for the way that you’re stepping forward. You’re engaging in the social distancing and doing the things that will slow the spread. We encourage you to keep on keeping on. We will get through this, America. We will get through the coronavirus to that day of renewed health, renewed prosperity that the president always describes. But we’ll get through there sooner and we’ll get through there when we work together.
Dr. Birx: (22:46)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President. Thank you for your words of discipline and determination. I guess that really describes what we’re asking every American to really be disciplined about these guidelines and really determine to stay in that space of execution. You know, we are just in week three of this full guidance measure. We really do appreciate the work of the citizens of California and Washington state because we do see that their curve is different. Their curve is different from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut and we really believe that the work that every citizen is doing in those states is making a difference and it will make a difference for the frontline healthcare providers. We also are deeply grateful that despite the way their curve looks today, they continue to get ready for a different potential, so that they can ensure that patients, if they do get sick, have options and availability.
Dr. Birx: (23:51)
To all the frontline healthcare workers in the what we have referred to as hot zones areas where the number of cases are quite significant. The New Orleans, the New York city metro area, including New Jersey and Connecticut, the incredible work that the front line health care workers are providing. We’ve really working now at a much more granular level, talking directly to hospitals to ensure that they have the supplies that they need in coordination with state and local governments. I think we discussed it yesterday, but I think it was quite clear, also, and reiterated by Governor Cuomo today, that we have to support one another as each of these different metro areas and other areas move through their peak of new infections.
Dr. Birx: (24:44)
When we talked about it at the beginning of this week, we talked about this week and next week being incredibly difficult and we want to recognize the number of Americans who have lost their lives to this virus and recognize the sacrifice that healthcare providers are making both in their care, but I think I’m very uplifted by hearing their messages to families and their compassion for others to provide that kind of support to the individuals in the hospital.
Dr. Birx: (25:13)
We continue to watch, in addition, the Chicago area, the Detroit area, and have some developing concerns around Colorado, the District of Columbia and Pennsylvania. As you can see, each of these will follow their own curves. We’ll be getting more and more of those case over time information in a very granular way to each and every one of you so that we can follow these epidemiologic curves as each of these states, counties and communities move through this together in solidarity. And really ensuring that we can move supplies creatively around the country to meet the needs of both the frontline healthcare providers, but also every American who needs our support right now. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (26:00)
Thank you very much.
Secretary Azar: (26:05)
Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your continued leadership as we battle the coronavirus. First, I want to thank all of the members of the HHS team and the frontline healthcare workers across America, including those service workers who serve in our hospitals and our health care facilities. Those who clean, those who deliver, those who stock the shelves, all those who are going into battle every day against the virus. Your country’s asked you to serve as never before and you have responded heroically. I’m going to provide a brief update on the administration’s plans to cover the testing and treatment for the uninsured. Getting the uninsured access to the care they need is a top priority for President Trump. We are already rolling out the $1 billion in funding from the Families first Coronavirus Response Act to cover provider’s expenses for testing and diagnosing the uninsured. The CARES Act signed by the president includes another $100 billion for healthcare providers.
Secretary Azar: (27:08)
Under the president’s direction, we will use a portion of that funding to cover provider’s costs of delivering COVID-19 care for the uninsured, sending the money to providers through the same mechanism used for testing. As a condition of receiving funds under this program, providers will be forbidden from balance billing the uninsured for the cost of their care. Providers will be reimbursed at Medicare rates. We will soon have more specifics on how the rest of the $100 billion will go to providers. We’re working to ensure that this funding is distributed in a way that is fast, fair, simple and transparent. I’d also like to remind people that if you’ve lost employer insurance coverage, you have insurance options that you should look into. You’d be eligible for a special enrollment period on the healthcare exchanges, and depending on your state, you may be eligible for Medicaid.
Secretary Azar: (28:10)
Just as President Trump is working to ensure that COVID-19 treatment is paid for, he’s working to support new treatment options for patients. Thanks to the president’s leadership, many providers are trying different experimental therapies and we need as much data as we can collect as quickly as possible on how these treatments are working. Today, Oracle has developed and is donating to the government and the American people a web portal and platform to gather crowdsourced realtime information from providers about how patients respond to potential therapeutics. While this doesn’t replace the important work of clinical trials, it gives us data rapidly. If you are a doctor or a healthcare provider and you would like to help us, you can sign up today to begin reporting on your work. There’s a special registration page for providers@covid19.oracle.com. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (29:10)
Okay. Let’s go. Steve?
Speaker 3: (29:12)
If we could draw you out a little bit more advice on face mask. What would people gain from wearing a mask and why are you opposed to wearing one yourself?
Donald Trump: (29:21)
I just don’t want to wear one myself. It’s a recommendation. They recommend it. I’m feeling good. I just don’t want to be doing, I don’t know, somehow sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk. I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens. I don’t know, somehow I don’t see it for myself. Maybe I’ll change my mind, but this will pass and hopefully it’ll pass very quickly.
Donald Trump: (29:55)
Now, with that being said, if somebody wants to… I mean most people can just make something out of a certain material, so it’s very well designated. It’s very simple to do. I won’t be doing it personally. It’s a recommendation. Okay?
Speaker 3: (30:12)
Would you like to say something about that?
Surgeon General Jerome Adams: (30:14)
Sure, absolutely.
Donald Trump: (30:15)
Surgeon General, please.
Surgeon General Jerome Adams: (30:20)
Thank you. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Secretary, and CDC Director Redfield. I especially want to thank the folks at the CDC and it’s a great question that you ask. It’s a fair question that you ask. I want to unpack the evolution of our guidance on masks because it has been confusing to the American people. First of all, I want people to understand that the CDC, the World Health Organization, my office, and most public health and health organizations and professionals originally recommended against the general public wearing masks because based on the best evidence available at the time, it was not deemed that that would have a significant impact on whether or not a healthy person wearing a mask would contract COVID-19. We have always recommended that symptomatic people wear a mask because if you’re coughing, if you have a fever, if you’re symptomatic, you could transmit the disease to other people.
Surgeon General Jerome Adams: (31:17)
What has changed in our recommendation? Well, it’s important to know that we now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms. They’re what we call asymptomatic, and that even those who eventually become presymptomatic, meaning that they will develop symptoms in the future, can transmit the virus to others before they show symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, for example, coughing, speaking or sneezing, even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms. In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends and the Task Force recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. These include places like grocery stores and pharmacies. We especially recommend this in areas of significant community based transmission.
Surgeon General Jerome Adams: (32:14)
It is critical and the president mentioned this, the vice president mentioned this. It’s critical to emphasize that maintaining six feet of social distancing remains key to slowing the spread of the virus, but CDC is additionally advising the use of simple cloth coverings to slow the spread of the virus and to help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical master N95 respirators. Those are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for healthcare workers and other medical first responders as recommended by the current CDC guidance. As the president also mentioned, cloth face covering fashioned from household items are made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional voluntary public health measure. This recommendation compliments and does not replace the president’s coronavirus guidelines for America 30 days to slow the spread, which remains the cornerstone of our national effort to slow the spread of the virus.
Surgeon General Jerome Adams: (33:15)
CDC is always, always looking at the data. We’ve told you that from the beginning. Dr. Burke said that every single press conference, we’re looking at the data, we’re evolving our recommendations, and new recommendations will come as the evidence dictates. I want to say, if you do choose to wear a face mask, very important, wash your hands first because you don’t want to put on a face covering with a dirty hand. Do not touch your face while you are wearing the face covering because again, you could take materials from the surface, germs from the surface, and bring it to your face. If you choose to wear a face covering, please, please leave the N95 masks, the medical supplies, for the medical professionals, healthcare workers and frontline workers. Know that this is not a substitute for social distancing.
Surgeon General Jerome Adams: (34:04)
Remember, this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me. This is about us coming together as communities and if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering, they’re wearing it to protect their neighbors from getting the coronavirus because again, they could have asymptomatic spread. Mr. President, thank you very much for that. Appreciate the opportunity to come.
Donald Trump: (34:29)
Okay.
Speaker 4: (34:31)
Mr. President, Dr. Fauci last night recommended, said that every state should have stay at home orders right now. Do you agree with that? Should every state in this country have the kind of stay at home owners that we now see in places like Washington?
Donald Trump: (34:43)
I’d talk to the governors. The governors know what they’re doing, they’ve been doing a great job. I guess we’re close to 90% anyway. The states that we’re talking about are not in jeopardy. No, I would leave it to the governors. I like that from the standpoint of governing and I like that from the standpoint of even our Constitution.
Speaker 5: (35:02)
Mr. President, to address the shortage in the blood supply, the Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday-
Donald Trump: (35:10)
I pointed at you. I heard a different voice, I heard a much different voice. We’ll get you later.
Speaker 6: (35:15)
Going to the oil meeting previously, is the US willing to cut domestic oil production? What came out of the meeting? What was the consensus?
Donald Trump: (35:22)
Well, a lot of things came out. It’s a great industry. It’s an important industry. It’s a tremendous job-producing industry and it’s just vital. It was also a very interesting because they all would get the test before they came into the room. You have the head of ExxonMobil, you have all these guys taking the test and they all passed with flying colors. That was good. They left happy in that respect, at least. There’s just an overabundance of oil right now. Oil and gas, tremendous overabundance and it was caused… They were doing a great job. They were producing a lot of energy, but then you had the virus come along and it knocked another 35%, maybe 40%, off of the market. There’s too much oil, there’s a glut, and these are great companies and they’ll figure it out. It’s free market. We’ll figure it out.
Speaker 6: (36:11)
You spoke to President Putin, I mean what’s on the table here?
Donald Trump: (36:16)
They were having a competition. We’ll see how it all works out. I think it’s going to work out very well. It’s going to take a long time to get rid of that. There’s massive excess amount of oil and gas. Massive, like probably there’s never been. Where that does work out well, I guess you could say, is for drivers. I think in certain locations, it’s down to 90 and 95 cents a gallon right now on the road. But we have a tremendous industry, a great industry. It’s tremendously important industry from the standpoint of jobs and we’re energy independent. We have to make sure we keep it that way. All right, please.
Speaker 5: (36:59)
… Then to address this shortage of blood supply, announced yesterday, would ease the restrictions on certain donors, including gay men who are now required to be abstinent for three months as opposed to 12 months to donate. Did you have a hand in that thing?
Donald Trump: (37:10)
Didn’t know anything about that. That was done by the FDA. Very capable people at the FDA.
Speaker 7: (37:17)
Yes, Mr. President. Both the government of Canada and 3M are pushing back on this DPA not to export N95 respirators. 3M says-
Donald Trump: (37:28)
I don’t blame them, they can push back if they want. We’re not happy with 3M. We’re not happy, and the people that dealt with it directly are not at all happy with 3M. We’ll see whether or not we do. I heard what he had to say today. I don’t know the gentleman, but we’re not happy with 3M. Go ahead.
Speaker 7: (37:43)
Where is Dr. Fauci?
Donald Trump: (37:45)
I don’t know. But every time you asked that question, whenever he’s not here, you look, you say, “Where is he?” And you’ll say, “Is there a problem?” No problem whatsoever. Every time he’s not here. Sometimes I’ll ask him to come because that’s the first question that you and a couple of others from the Fake News Establishment ask is, “Where’s Dr. Fauci?” We’re doing great together. We’re covering a different subject today. Go ahead.
Speaker 8: (38:09)
Different subject. Mr. President, you have said, nobody could have seen this pandemic coming, but in fact, Secretary Azar at a biodefense summit in April 2019 said, “Of course the people, of course, the thing that people ask, what keeps you most up at night in the biodefense world? Pandemic flu, of course. I think everyone in this room probably shares that concern.” Your own Health and Human Services secretary was aware that this had the potential of being a very big problem around the world, a pandemic of this nature. Who dropped the ball?
Donald Trump: (38:43)
Well, I always knew that pandemics are one of the worst things could happen. There’s been nothing like this since probably 1917, that was the big one in Europe. It started actually here and went to Europe, probably. I’ve heard about… Excuse me. Wait a minute. Let me finish. I’ve heard about this for a long time. Pandemics. You don’t want pandemics. I don’t think he was talking about a specific pandemic, he was talking about the threat of a pandemic could happen and it could happen. Most people thought it wouldn’t, and most people didn’t understand the severity of it. This is very severe. What’s happened is very severe, but I’d let you answer that. I assume that he was talking about the concept of a pandemic.
Secretary Azar: (39:24)
Thank you, Mr. President. Absolutely. For 15 years now, this country is at a massive effort at the federal, state and local level of preparedness for a pandemic. Now, that largely has been, as I said in those remarks, about pandemic flu preparedness. We knew about SARS, we knew about MERS, which were earlier modifications or variants of the coronavirus. None of those achieved anything like what we’re seeing today, but that’s why four successive presidencies, including the leadership of President Trump, there has been a great focus on pandemic preparedness. In fact, it was just in November, I believe, that the president signed the Pandemic Flu Preparedness Executive.
Secretary Azar: (40:03)
… November, I believe, that the president signed the pandemic flu preparedness executive order, and we have also updated the pandemic crisis action plan, which has been the playbook from which we’ve been working. The pandemic flu plan, again, the action plan from which we have been working that coordinates the whole of government, whole of economy approach here. So we’ve all been very focused on pandemic preparedness. That’s what we do. But this particular strain of pandemic, who would have known this particular strain?
Jim Acosta: (40:33)
Secretary Azar, if you were preparing for a pandemic, if this government were preparing for a pandemic, why is it we don’t have enough masks? Why is it we don’t have enough medical equipment in this country?
Donald Trump: (40:43)
Previous administrations gave us very little ammunition for the military and very little shelf space. Let me just tell you. You know it. You know the answer. The previous administration, the shelves were empty. The shelves were empty. So what you should do is speak to the people from the previous administration, Jim, and ask them that question because the shelves were empty. You know what else? The military shelves were also empty. We had no ammunition, literally, and that was said by one of your favorite generals. Sir, we have no ammunition. Guess what? We had very little medical supply also. All right. Go ahead. We’ll get it back. We’ll get you back. We’ll get you back, please.
Jim Acosta: (41:26)
What about that question-
Donald Trump: (41:28)
Jim, I said we’ll get you back. Please go ahead.
Speaker 9: (41:30)
So I wanted to ask you about the DPA. So you said that there will be a ban on exporting of all, what does it cover? So masks, gloves, what else?
Donald Trump: (41:37)
It covers everything.
Speaker 9: (41:37)
Is it in that order? Are you-
Donald Trump: (41:39)
But if somebody ordered, if Italy, if Spain who has big problems, these are countries with tremendous problems. France, if they ordered, if they have long-term orders and they’re in there and they want to get certain things, I’ve let them go out in certain instances because I think it’s only fair. They have problems that are proportionately or relatively bigger than our problems. So if they ordered something and they’re waiting for, as an example, masks made here and going to Italy, I’m not going to be stopping that. I think it would be very unfair.
Donald Trump: (42:09)
By the way, speaking about being fair and unfair, two very big cruise liners, as you know, I allowed them to dock today. We worked with the governor of Florida, as you know, Ron DeSantis, and we worked on it, and we had tremendous security. We took the sick people, and we’re working with them. We have doctors. We have great doctors, military doctors. From a humane standpoint, not that we’re in love with this, these are two massive ships, but we have to take care of people. We have to take care of them.
Donald Trump: (42:40)
We sent many back to Canada. The Canadians came and worked very closely with us as did the UK. We had a lot of people from the UK, and we took care of the Americans. We took care of the sick. We had some people very sick. I think we had three to four, maybe five people that had died on the boat, one of the boats actually, and we had to take care of these people. So we could have let them float aimlessly into the ocean looking for port as they’ve been doing for a long time, and I made the decision we had to take them in. Homeland Security and a lot of other people did a great job, but we had to help people. These are people that were very, very sick. Some were dying. Some died. Please. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 10: (43:25)
Your staff today said that people who are in close proximity to you and the vice president will get a Coronavirus test. I’m wondering, are you concerned that the people you’ve been hanging around with may have the virus?
Donald Trump: (43:35)
No, I’m not concerned. No. I had a test yesterday.
Speaker 10: (43:38)
Well, what’s the reason for the order for people who meet with you or talk to you. Why [crosstalk 00:43:42]
Donald Trump: (43:41)
I don’t know. I mean, I heard from the oil executives. These are people, most of them had not had the test, and frankly I think they left the room feeling good about a lot of things, but they felt good about the test. This was a test that took, I guess, 13 minutes to have it finalized. They took the test. I don’t know. I didn’t know they were doing that. Maybe they did it just for them. I don’t know. But it seems that a lot of people, because now we have tests that really work well. Abbott, in this case Abbott. We have other tests being developed right now that are also fantastic. The original tests, the ones we inherited, Jim, as an example, they were broken. They were obsolete. They were not good tests, and that’s what we got stuck with. We’ve developed some incredible tests, but this took 13 to 15 minutes, and they were all fine. Go ahead. Finish your question.
Speaker 9: (44:29)
The problem some people have raised is that if the US stopped exporting, what you could have is other countries then deciding reciprocally that they are going to stop exporting and that the result of that then will be a net decrease in the amount of supplies that American doctors, American hospitals have. How do you address that?
Donald Trump: (44:44)
Well, I address it in the following manner. We really are very well supplied. We are not the principal. It’s the hospitals, the states, the cities, they’re supposed to get everything they can and stock up in case something like this happens. But nobody could ever have assumed that something like this happened. So we started supplying. We brought tremendous amounts to New York today and over the last few days. We brought them to Louisiana. We brought them to Michigan. We brought them to Los Angeles. A lot of equipment.
Donald Trump: (45:16)
You’ve read the amount of masks that we had. I think I said over 8 million masks. The n95 masks, the more expensive, more complicated, better, whatever masks, the ones they want to use in the hospitals, we have millions of them now. We’ve given them to a lot. We sent to Bellevue in New York today. That was from Mayor de Blasio? 200,000 of them, but we have 8.1 million.
Donald Trump: (45:45)
We’re going to have more than that and we’re getting them from various sources, including the military. We’re rapidly then replacing them because we have to replace them in case there’s another emergency. Gowns too. We have many gowns being delivered and have been delivered. Our people have done an incredible job. Most people have said, and I said this yesterday, governors have said thank you very much. Great job. If they’re a Democrat governor, in some cases, not in all cases at all.
Donald Trump: (46:14)
If I said, “Here’s 1000 ventilators. How many do you want?” “We want 1000.” “Here’s 1000. You got them. But you know what we’re going to do? We’re going to add another 5,000. Is that good?” They said, “Wow, that’s great.” Then if Jim Acosta goes and says, “Are you happy with the president?” “No, he should have given us 10,000.” That’s what’s happening. You know why? Because that’s a standard political answer, and that’s a shame because we have done a job like nobody’s ever done a job. But we’ve just delivered a lot of masks. We’ve just delivered a lot of gowns and protective gear. But you’re talking about a massive number. But as of this morning, people were very, very happy. Steve?
Steve: (46:54)
Did oil executives ask you for a bailout of any sort?
Donald Trump: (46:56)
No, they didn’t ask for a bailout, no.
Steve: (46:58)
What did they ask for?
Donald Trump: (47:01)
It was really more of a discussion than asking. We did discuss the concept of tariffs because, as you know, this was a dispute among a couple of countries that I think they want to be able to get it solved. They had a dispute. They had a competition, but they want to get it resolved. Russia and Saudi Arabia, I think they want to get it-
Steve: (47:24)
Russia and Saudi Arabia?
Donald Trump: (47:24)
Yeah, I think they want to get it resolved. I think they’re working very hard. I mean, they told me they want to get it resolved. They’re working very hard. Go ahead.
Speaker 11: (47:30)
Thank you. Yesterday Jared Kushner said the notion of the federal stockpile was, it’s supposed to be our stockpile. It’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use. What did he mean by our?
Donald Trump: (47:44)
What are you asking?
Speaker 11: (47:45)
Even the fact that taxpayers from every state pays for it.
Donald Trump: (47:47)
What’s that? A got you? I got you. You used the word our.
Speaker 11: (47:50)
No, it’s not a got you.
Donald Trump: (47:50)
Our, you know what our means? United States of America. That’s what it means.
Speaker 11: (47:52)
What about the states?
Donald Trump: (47:55)
Our. Our. It means the United States of America. Then we take that our, and we distribute it to the states. Not that we have to-
Speaker 11: (48:02)
So why did you say it’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use?
Donald Trump: (48:06)
Because we need it for the government, and we need it for the federal government. But when the states are in-
Speaker 11: (48:12)
To give to the states.
Donald Trump: (48:12)
No to also keep-
Speaker 11: (48:14)
Then who are you giving it to if it’s not to the states?
Donald Trump: (48:16)
To keep for our country because the federal government needs it too, not just the states. But out of that, we oftentimes choose. As an example, we have almost 10,000 ventilators, and we are ready to rock with those ventilators. We’re going to bring them to various areas of the country that need them. But when he says our, he’s talking about our country. He’s talking-
Speaker 11: (48:37)
He makes a distinction, and sir-
Donald Trump: (48:37)
Excuse me. He’s talking about the federal government. I mean, it’s such a basic, simple question, and you try and make it sound so bad.
Speaker 11: (48:45)
It’s not bad. I’m just trying to understand.
Donald Trump: (48:46)
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Speaker 11: (48:47)
No, by the way, Secretary Azar-
Donald Trump: (48:48)
You know what? You ought to be ashamed. It’s such a simple question. He said our, and our means for the country and our means [crosstalk 00:48:58] for the states because the states are part of the country. Don’t make it sound bad. Don’t make it sound bad. Go ahead, Steve. Go ahead. Back here.
Speaker 11: (49:07)
Maybe just even change the language on the website.
Donald Trump: (49:07)
You just asked your question. You just asked your question in a very nasty tone. Let’s go.
Speaker 11: (49:13)
You didn’t give me an answer.
Donald Trump: (49:14)
Please.
Speaker 12: (49:14)
Mr. President-
Donald Trump: (49:15)
I gave you a perfect answer. You know it. Go ahead.
Speaker 12: (49:17)
Well, just to follow up on that, when we have the federal stockpile, I mean, isn’t that designed to be able to distribute to the states if needed?
Donald Trump: (49:28)
Sure, but it’s also needed for the federal government. We have a federal stockpile, and they have state stockpiles, and frankly they were, many of the states were totally unprepared for this. So we had to go into the federal stockpile, but we’re not an ordering clerk. They have to have for themselves. Now some of the states were in good shape. Some of the states were not in good shape. That’s probably something you could expect.
Donald Trump: (49:51)
We have been helping states. We have been spending a tremendous amount of time, effort and billions and billions of dollars on making sure that they have what they have. I mean, take New York. We built them hospitals. I built them four hospitals, built them medical centers, sent a ship with 1,000 rooms and 12 operating rooms. Then on top of that gave vast numbers of ventilators and vast numbers of surgical gowns, equipment, masks, everything else.
Donald Trump: (50:19)
Now they had a chance to order ventilators over the years. They had a chance to order very big, but they didn’t choose to do it. We were there, and we helped them, and I think the governor of New York is very thankful for the help that we gave. But we have a stockpile. It’s a federal stockpile. We can use that for states, or we can use it for ourselves. We do use it for the federal government. We have a very big federal government. Go ahead.
Speaker 12: (50:44)
Have you decided not to use your powers to be essentially a traffic cop for all the essential medical supplies that are needed?
Donald Trump: (50:50)
We’re not a traffic cop. We’re a humanitarian cop. We help. It’s like the ships. Do you think we wanted to take two big ships into our country that have obvious problems? You know the problems I’m talking about. So I have a decision to make. Do I take them in, or do I save lives? Okay? Do I take them in, or do I save? I decided to take them in.
Donald Trump: (51:13)
We have tremendous protection. We have great doctors there to help the people. They had four or five people that died. That was as of last night. They died on the ships. We took care of it. Now the people are in the process of, and many are already back in Canada. They’re back in the UK, United Kingdom, and many of them were American citizens. Some were very sick. We’re taking care of the sick people. We’re testing all of the others very, very carefully, very, very carefully. They are being tested like you wouldn’t believe, and we solve a humanitarian catastrophe. You know why? Because nobody else would take the ships. Nobody else would take them. So we docked them in, I think, Fort Lauderdale.
Speaker 12: (51:58)
Can you tell me why you don’t say, we’re the federal government and there’s a shortage of masks and other things and we’re going to sign off on [crosstalk 00:52:06]
Donald Trump: (52:06)
We do say that. We say, and we use the act. Excuse me. We do say that, and we use the act. We’ve used it a number of times very powerfully, and a lot of times we don’t have to use it because we say we’re going to use it if you don’t do this or that. Then we also have companies that act incredibly well. We have plenty of them, mostly them, but we’ve used the act very powerfully. A lot of times you don’t have to exercise the act. All you have to do is tell them, “Look, if you don’t do this, we’re going to use the act.” We’ve done a good job with it. Maybe a great job. Yeah.
Speaker 13: (52:41)
Mr. President, there are news reports that you want to sign the stimulus checks that are going out here in several months. Is that right? Do you want to sign those?
Donald Trump: (52:48)
No. Me sign? No. There’s millions of checks. I’m going to sign them? No. It’s a Trump administration initiative, but do I want to sign them? No. The people are getting their money. There’s a lot of stimulus going in a lot of different ways. There’s also a stimulus going for companies that, if it weren’t for our government, would not and some companies that were very strong a month ago.
Donald Trump: (53:11)
Again, we had the strongest economy in the world. We had our best ever. We had probably the best economy in the history of the world, bigger than China, bigger than anybody, and one day we have to say, close it up, stop. Everybody, go home. You know what? It’s pretty tough to do that.
Speaker 13: (53:33)
That’s another thing. There’s been rumors that these checks may not go out for another four months. If you don’t get [crosstalk 00:53:36].
Donald Trump: (53:35)
I don’t know. All I can tell you is that small business today is that we’re way ahead of schedule. There is a problem, which I pointed out, I said you shouldn’t do it this way, with unemployment, where 40 year old equipment by the states. We’re sending the money to the states. Once the money is sent to the states, then the states, whether they’re Republican or Democrat, have to get the money out to the people. Hopefully they will be able to do it. But many of those states have 40 year old computers. I don’t know that they’re equipped. I wanted to give the money direct if that’s what you’re talking about. I wanted to give the money out direct. It Would have been much easier. But the Democrats and some people said, no, let’s do it the complicated way.
Speaker 13: (54:14)
I’m talking more about the stimulus checks. When can people get their money by?
Donald Trump: (54:17)
All right. Excuse me. I was talking about both. They’ll get it. They will. Go ahead please.
Speaker 14: (54:21)
Thank you, sir. I’d like to ask questions both for myself and some of the other reporters who are in the room. Social distancing. First of all, and this is for yourself and Dr. Birx, what percentage of the population do we suspect to be asymptomatic at this point? Is there a way to figure that out? It seems like the antibody test might be able to assist in determining that number.
Dr. Birx: (54:46)
Yeah, thank you. So while we’re working diligently in the midst of the crisis to make sure that the healthcare workers and everyone who is sick gets provided for, at the same time we’re working on tests and assays that will be critical for surveillance and at the same time working on plans for what we need to do as this moves through the population and we get on the downside, which we’re not there yet. Hopefully most of the states will stay, like California and Washington, and then what we need to do to be prepared for fall.
Dr. Birx: (55:22)
So all three of those things are happening simultaneously, and there’s people working on each one of those work streams. The antibody piece is critical, as you described, because at this time, let’s say symptomatic status is inversely related to age, and so the younger you are, the more likely you are to be asymptomatic. We have to know that because we have to know how many people have actually become infected.
Dr. Birx: (55:51)
So when we talked about five days ago, I think on Monday, I called on universities to work on an ELISA-based test to test their health workers and really get through that. At the same time, the private sector is working on tests. What do we want those tests to be? We want those tests to be like what we use for HIV and malaria. Finger prick onto a cassette. You get a line if you’re positive, and you get a control line. Negative, the line isn’t there and there’s the control line. That’s our dream assay because it’s a finger prick.
Dr. Birx: (56:26)
In the meantime we’re not waiting. I mean, we’re pushing for that. At the same time we’re asking to develop an assay, the ELISA-based assay, which requires a tube of blood. That’s why we’re also talking about could we use dry blood spots. We also put a call directly out to the military because of the Roosevelt to really test all of the sailors on the Roosevelt with an antibody test to get to this critical issue of asymptomatic and already preexisting antibody.
Dr. Birx: (56:59)
That would be if the first responders knew they already had had it and they had protective antibody. If the nurses knew, the doctors knew, if your school teacher knew, then it’s a very different dialogue. So we understand the importance of that, and we understand how important it is in relationship to understanding this epidemic.
Dr. Birx: (57:19)
One other comment because I know we’re always saying who knew what when. I just want to make clear. There’s 150-plus countries working on this collectively together. It’s devastating for every single country. When we get through this, we can go back and look at what happened where and what does this epidemic look like. Then when you get through it, then you can validate every model there is known to man. When you’re in the middle of it, you have to concentrate on serving the needs of each American and what that need looks like.
Dr. Birx: (57:57)
At the same time you have these other work streams on surveillance and how to be prepared both scientifically and therapeutically and vaccine wise for the next fall if it happens again. So I think these things are happening together, but I just want us to really concentrate on the fact that all around the globe, country after country is dealing with this.
Dr. Birx: (58:20)
We can talk about why didn’t Italy do something or Spain do something or Germany do something, or we can really say, right now we all can do something. We can do the social distancing and all of the pieces that we know is starting to work around the globe in country after country. Then when we get through all of this, we can ask the questions about could we have done some piece of this better as a global community. I will remind you that on February 3rd the head of the WHO said there was no reason to ever do a travel ban. It wasn’t until January 14th that we knew that there was human-to-human transmission.
Speaker 15: (59:04)
The president was saying this was going to go away. It’s April.
Donald Trump: (59:08)
It is going to go away.
Speaker 15: (59:08)
But Mr. President, you said it was going to go away in April. You said that one day-
Donald Trump: (59:13)
I didn’t say a day. I said it’s going away, and it is going away. Okay. Are you … Okay. That was a good answer to your question. No, no, no, no, no, no more. That was a long but a very good answer. That was enough for you.
Speaker 16: (59:26)
Mr. President, on the insurance coverage for treatment, when your government is going is trying to make sure that people are covered on the treatment-
Donald Trump: (59:34)
Yeah, we’re going to do that.
Speaker 16: (59:35)
Does that include the 11 million people who are in this country illegally? Are they going to be covered as well?
Donald Trump: (59:41)
We will be talking about that at a different time. Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 17: (59:44)
Yes, Mr. President, will you authorize the release of the underlying data for the conclusion of the 100,000 to 240,000 people succumbing? Perhaps Dr. Birx can talk-
Donald Trump: (59:57)
That’s up to Dr. Birx. You will decide.
Dr. Birx: (59:59)
We can release all of the-
Speaker 17: (01:00:03)
There’s some-
Dr. Birx: (01:00:03)
We can release all of the …
Speaker 18: (01:00:03)
Disease experts have expressed concern that they haven’t seen the underlying data. They’re not quite sure …
Donald Trump: (01:00:08)
I’m sure they’ll talk to you about that, and Dr. Fauci, too. Please. Go ahead.
Speaker 19: (01:00:12)
Thank you. Mr. President. This is for UN Secretary Azar. 10 million people say they’ve lost their jobs in the past two weeks, so how has the stimulus money for free treatment going to absorb the new numbers of uninsured and would it not be easier to reopen the Obamacare markets or expand Medicaid?
Secretary Azar: (01:00:28)
So for an individual who had employer insurance, that’s what I mentioned in my remarks, if you were employed and had insurance through your employer and you’ve now lost your job and lost that insurance, you now do have a special enrollment period where you may enroll in the individual exchanges of the Affordable Care Act, So that’s existing law. Then what we’re doing is taking from that hundred billion dollars to providers, taking money and saying, if you’re a provider and you care for anybody who is uninsured, we’re going to compensate you for doing that.
Secretary Azar: (01:00:59)
And we’re going to compensate you at the Medicare reimbursement rates and you are not allowed to bill that uninsured individual anything. So in many respects it’s better for those uninsured individuals. They’re going to get first dollar coverage, they’re going to get care in the United States and the provider is going to be made whole from this program. So it’s really an unprecedented … What President Trump is doing here with this money is an unprecedented disease-specific support of care for individuals to make sure that people get treatment.
Speaker 19: (01:01:30)
Still be that if you test negative or what about non COVID conditions?
Speaker 20: (01:01:34)
A couple of questions about supplies, one specifically on New York and the question of ventilators. Governor Cuomo was saying that New York may be days away from running out of ventilators. Can you assure New York that going into next week that they’re going to have the ventilators that they’re going to need?
Donald Trump: (01:01:50)
No, they should’ve had more ventilators at the time. They should have had more ventilators. They were totally under-serviced. We are trying to do, we’re doing our best for New York. We have states. We have a lot of states. We have territory’s too, but we have a lot of states that have to be taken care of, some much more so than others. We’ve worked very well with the governor. We happen to think that he’s well-served with ventilators. We’re going to find out, but we have other states to take care of. We have a big problem in Louisiana. We have a big problem in Michigan.
Donald Trump: (01:02:24)
We have a big problem and seven other really strong hotspots, but we’re doing the best we can. I wish they did the original orders three years ago. They would’ve had all the ventilators they needed, although even then they wouldn’t. Because if you look at what the original request was from New York, it was far greater than anybody ever heard and we’ve supplied a lot. I told you we supplied some just today to New York and we supplied some yesterday to New York City. Did you have one in the back? Yeah, please.
John: (01:02:56)
This is why the question of the stockpile that was asked earlier is so important.
Donald Trump: (01:02:59)
I don’t think that was the question.
John: (01:03:01)
It was a very important question because what Jared Kushner said yesterday is that the federal stockpile is for use by the federal government, not for the states to have access to. So you seem to be saying different, so did Jared Kushner misspeak yesterday?
Donald Trump: (01:03:13)
No, he didn’t misspeak.
John: (01:03:13)
Is that federal stockpile available to the states?
Donald Trump: (01:03:15)
He used the word, our. Okay. Our. Our is referring to our country …
John: (01:03:20)
Not for the states to use?
Donald Trump: (01:03:20)
The states, to the best of my knowledge and to the best of your knowledge, are a part of our country. We are taking what is in the federal stockpile and we are helping states all over the country, but we also want to keep some because when that surge comes, when you hit those peaks, we’re going to need, we have to be able to have the flexibility to take those ventilators and bring them to Louisiana, New York, Detroit, different places. That’s all.
John: (01:03:44)
So you will be using them for the states?
Donald Trump: (01:03:46)
Of course, we’re not using them anywhere else. We’re not going to be using them, John, anywhere else. But we want the flexibility because we don’t even know when the surge is coming but it’s coming soon and it’s going to be big and some areas won’t have it. Some areas will be pleasantly surprised just like we’ve been, you look at the chart. States that I thought would have been maybe a disaster turned out to be really, they’d done a great job. Some states are really trouble, but you don’t know. You don’t know. We have great flexibility.
Donald Trump: (01:04:14)
I would have preferred giving them all out. We’d have nothing and now when we have a surge we can’t get them back from where we gave them because it’s very tough to take it back. So we have tremendous flexibility and it could be New York, it could be Louisiana. Those are two that are really rough. New Jersey is very rough and they’ve done a very good job in New Jersey. But New Jersey is very rough. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 21: (01:04:34)
Yes. The question or the question is about the CDC guidelines. I know that they changed over time from February and …
Donald Trump: (01:04:40)
The guidelines relative to which? The masks?
Speaker 21: (01:04:42)
Social distancing and the number of peoples who can gather in a group and so on. And now we have this measure about wearing masks and I know you told Steve about why you don’t want to wear a mask, but I’m just wondering if you can tell us more about why because it would set …
Donald Trump: (01:04:56)
I just don’t use them.
Speaker 21: (01:04:57)
An example.
Donald Trump: (01:04:58)
They’re not mandatory guidelines. They’re guidelines. They suggest you could wear them, don’t have to wear them. In fact, the director is here. If you want to say a couple of words about it, you can if you want. You don’t have to. But basically it’s a voluntary thing. Say it directly. Doing a good job.
Speaker 22: (01:05:16)
Thank you very much. I think I just want to reemphasize, I’ve said this before, that we’re not defenseless against this virus. We have a powerful tool, a powerful weapon that is social distancing and we’ve continued to embrace that with the president’s initiatives to slow the spread of coronavirus. We’re constantly looking at new data. And as the surgeon general said, one of the new information that became more clear to all of us is there’s a greater number of people that are asymptomatically infected than we previously thought.
Speaker 22: (01:05:46)
And as Ambassador Birx said, that may be inversely related to age. And so really the purpose here is first and foremost to embrace the social distancing. That’s the number one thing. That’s the powerful weapon. And this virus has a great weakness. It can’t jump from one person to another if it’s got to swim more than six feet. And this is why we really want that. That said, we now know that there may be individuals in areas of significant community transmission that may be asymptomatically infected. And we know that a face barrier can actually interrupt the number of virus particles that can go for one person to the other.
Speaker 22: (01:06:24)
So as was said by the vice president and the president, the purpose of this face covering is to be another adjunctive mitigation strategy to protect someone from spreading the virus from themself to someone else.
Donald Trump: (01:06:41)
And I was just tested also, so I assume I don’t have the virus so I don’t have to worry about spreading it. Okay. Please go ahead.
Speaker 23: (01:06:49)
Mr. President, I want to make sure we’re clear. When you mentioned tariffs earlier, if it came up in a meeting, are you considering terrorists on Saudi Arabian oil? Also ….
Donald Trump: (01:06:58)
I’m always considering. Look, tariffs have made a tremendous amount of money for our country. I put them on China, I put them on other places and other countries tariff us and they take advantage of us or they have for many years. Look, countries have taken advantage of the United States for years. They’ve ripped us off like nobody can even believe, whether it be on manufacturing, whether it be on exporting, whether it be on almost anything, including military where we provide virtually free military assistance to countries that frankly take advantage of us. Don’t even like us.
Donald Trump: (01:07:33)
Okay. So this has been going on for years. They terrify us, they create artificial, you could say nonfinancial barriers, which are worse than financial barriers. You can’t sell your product. You can’t take care of our farmers. They won’t take our and yet they’ll take us and sell into us and we won’t charge them anything for doing it. Look, they’ve taken advantage of us for years. Tariffs are a way of evening the score. Tariffs are a way of just neutralizing. They have tariffs on us and we now can put tariffs on them. Am I using it for oil? It’s something we can. No.
Donald Trump: (01:08:10)
Am I doing it now? No. Am I thinking about imposing it as of this moment? No. But if we’re not treated fairly, it’s certainly a tool in the toolbox.
Speaker 23: (01:08:21)
And what about with Russia? Are you what you consider maybe lifting sanctions or giving some sanctions relief?
Donald Trump: (01:08:24)
It would be the same thing. No. It would be the same thing. They are having a dispute, the two countries, and it’s hurting the rest of the world because it’s really hurting the energy industry. Russia’s being hurt unbelievably badly and Saudi Arabia is being hurt unbelievably badly because oil and gas is a primary, that’s where they get most of their income. And this is a price like from the 1950s. Right? It’s a price from the 1950s. They are being hurt very badly. I think they’re going to settle their dispute pretty quickly. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 24: (01:09:04)
On the oil, why do you raise the price? Why do you think you haven’t been more accessible in getting them to increase production in Russia and Saudi Arabia?
Donald Trump: (01:09:11)
Well, they haven’t production. That’s what they’ve done. They’ve increased it so much that they’re, so you meant the opposite.
Speaker 24: (01:09:17)
Why haven’t you been successful?
Donald Trump: (01:09:18)
Look, well, they’re going to stop because the market. Ultimately, the market is going to get them to stop, but they both did the opposite. They increased production to a level that water is right now more valuable than oil. Who would have ever thought? You go to some of these kingdoms, water is far more valuable than oil. There’s so much oil. It’s a tribute in a way. But what happened is there was a lot to start off with and then you had the virus and it knocked the hell out of the market in terms of demand. So there is no demand and this tremendous supply.
Donald Trump: (01:09:56)
So, I mean you saw our numbers where it was down to 20 and down frankly below 20. It was even below 20. It’s an incredible thing, the market, but ultimately the marketplace will take care of it. But I think they’re going to work out their problem fairly quickly. Okay. Go ahead.
Speaker 25: (01:10:12)
Thank you, Mr. President. We’re already talking about phase four of a stimulus, but you and Pelosi and McConnell are already talking about different things that should be in it. Now, last time, people were telling me that the fact that you wouldn’t talk to Pelosi was an impediment and it really slowed things down. Are you …
Donald Trump: (01:10:29)
I’d talk. If it were important to talk to her, I’d talk to her. If it were important for the American people, I’d talk to her. But other than that, I can have other people talking to her. Look, you ready? Infrastructure is a great thing for me. I think infrastructure for this country, we have an old broken infrastructure. 50 years ago, we were the envy of the world and then we spent all this money so stupidly in the Middle East. We spent, it’s going to be very close to $8 trillion in the Middle East. How stupid was that decision? But they spent it on that and other things.
Donald Trump: (01:11:03)
We’ve got to fix our infrastructure. That means roads, highways, tunnels, airports, everything. We got to fix our infrastructure. And the beauty is because of the fact that we are so strong as a country, we’re borrowing at zero. We never had a chance to borrow at zero. Even this country, we never had a chance to borrow at zero. We’re going to borrow. This is a great time so we can fix our infrastructure and we’ll have almost no interest because this is the time to do it. Steve, one more question.
Steve: (01:11:31)
The death total projections that you shared with us earlier this week, are we still on the current trajectory for that or have …
Donald Trump: (01:11:38)
Which one? I have many trajectories for many things.
Steve: (01:11:40)
100 to 40,000. Are we still on that trajectory or have we made any improvements or maybe not enough time has passed?
Donald Trump: (01:11:47)
Say it, Steve. What?
Steve: (01:11:49)
Have we made enough improvement?
Donald Trump: (01:11:50)
On what?
Steve: (01:11:51)
On social models?
Donald Trump: (01:11:54)
I’d have to ask Dr. Fauci, and I’d have to ask Deborah. Have the models changed?
Dr. Birx: (01:12:02)
So a lot of the projections you can see are based on, there’s many different ways to look at this. And as we discussed on Sunday, some of it is based on the current global experience. We are about, I think, 6.5 or 5.5 times the size of Italy, a different factor in Spain. And we look at all of those, what their projections are, where they are currently and where that is going, and so a lot of the work is based on how this virus has moved through other populations. That’s a very direct way to see how the virus is impacting of populations.
Dr. Birx: (01:12:41)
There’s also terrific models and so every day and every night, one of the models that actually looks at the model related to mortality is the healthdata.org data and they update it every night. And you can see where we are in that projection. I think in the last run of that model, they were at 93,000 or something in the model. Now all of that can be changed by our behaviors and all of it can be changed in a different way if we don’t follow those behaviors. If another major metropolitan area ends up having an epidemic like the New York Metro Area, that could dramatically change, not the model, but the reality of the impact of this virus on Americans.
Donald Trump: (01:13:34)
The models show hundreds of thousands of people are going to die. You know what I want to do? I want to come away under the models. If professionals did the models, I was never involved in a model, but…at least this is kind of a model…but you know what, hundreds of thousands of people they say are going to die, I want much less than that. I want none. But it’s too late for that, but I want very few people relative to what the models are saying. Those are projections. I hope they’re wrong. I hope we’re going to be under those projections.
Speaker 26: (01:14:07)
Mr. President, two questions on continuity of government.
Donald Trump: (01:14:10)
How come you always have two? Why can’t you have one?
Speaker 26: (01:14:12)
Well, they relay.
Donald Trump: (01:14:13)
Every time, I have three questions. I have two questions. Can you give me one instead because there are a couple of other people? Go ahead.
Speaker 26: (01:14:18)
Okay. I’ll go with my second one. Governor of Wisconsin is not talking about delaying the primary, at least not having to in-person voting. So my question is, and I asked this a couple of weeks ago, I want to see if you’ve made any progress on this. Looking ahead to the fall, are you taking steps to ensure that the general election will happen even if this pandemic has re-emerged or hasn’t gone away?
Donald Trump: (01:14:38)
The general election will happen on November 3rd. In Wisconsin, what happened is I, through social media, put out a very strong endorsement of a Republican conservative judge who’s an excellent, brilliant judge. He’s a justice. And I hear what happened is his poll numbers went through the roof and because of that, I think they delayed the election.
Speaker 26: (01:15:02)
Aren’t you concerned about people going to in-person voting?
Donald Trump: (01:15:04)
I don’t know. Why didn’t he do it before? He’s doing the right before the election.
Speaker 26: (01:15:07)
But, do you think every …
Donald Trump: (01:15:08)
Excuse me. Why didn’t he do this two weeks ago? All of a sudden, excuse me. All of a sudden, an election which is taking place very soon, gets delayed now. I just endorsed him today and it was a very strong endorsement. His polls, he’s gone very high up and all of a sudden the governor comes out, the Democrat governor, by the way, comes out and says, oh, we’re going to move this election. So I don’t know. I hope you’re right. I hope you’re right.
Speaker 26: (01:15:34)
Do you think every state in this country should be prepared for mail in voting in case we’re in a situation?
Donald Trump: (01:15:39)
No. I think a lot of people cheat with mail in voting. I think people should vote with ID, voter ID. I think voter ID is very important and the reason they don’t want voter ID is because they intend to cheat. When you get something, when you buy something, you look at your cards and credit cards and different cards. You have your picture and many of them, not all of them, but on many of them, you should have a picture on your for voting. It should be called voter ID. They should have that and it shouldn’t be mail in, excuse me. It shouldn’t be mail in voting.
Donald Trump: (01:16:11)
It should be you go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don’t send it in the mail where people pick up. All sorts of bad things can happen by the time they sign that, if they sign that, if they sign that, by the time it gets in and it’s tabulated. No, it shouldn’t be mailed in. You should vote at the booth and you should have voter ID. Because when you have voter ID, that’s the real deal. Thank you very much. We’ll see you tomorrow.
Speaker 27: (01:16:39)
Do you have an update on the domestic travel restrictions?
Speaker 28: (01:16:48)
Why did the website definition of a stockpile change? Why did the definition of a stockpile change this morning on your website?"
"Apr 2, 2020","22, 2020","Donald Trump: (01:08)
Okay. Thank you very much. Good to be with you all. We’re in a very critical phase of our war against the coronavirus. It’s vital that every American follows our guidelines on the 30 days to slow the spread. The sacrifices we make over the next four weeks will have countless American lives saved. We’re going to save a lot of American lives. We’re in control of our own fate, very much so. Maintaining social distance, practicing vigorous hygiene and staying at home are your most effective ways to win the war and to escape danger.
Donald Trump: (01:54)
While you’re fighting this battle from home we’re working with the best scientists, doctors, and researchers anywhere in the world. We’re racing to develop new ways to protect against the virus as well as therapies, treatments, and ultimately a vaccine, and we’re making a lot of progress, I think medically a lot of progress.
Donald Trump: (02:14)
At the same time, we’re also racing to get relief to American workers and small businesses, as you know. I want to remind small business owners across America that the paycheck protection program is launching tomorrow. Nearly $350 billion in loans will be available to small businesses including sole proprietors. These loans are up to 100% forgivable as long as employers keep paying their workers, got to take care of your workers.
Donald Trump: (02:46)
Furthermore, we want Social Security beneficiaries to know that if they are typically not required to file a tax return, they don’t have to file one in order to receive the direct cash payments that will soon be distributed to American citizens. The treasury will deposit the money directly into the bank accounts, and don’t forget, I will always protect your Social Security, your Medicare and your Medicaid. We’re protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and I always will.
Donald Trump: (03:18)
I’d like now to invite SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza who is doing a fantastic job. She’s going to be very busy in the next little while and Secretary Steve Mnuchin to say a few words about these vital initiatives and then we’ll get onto the attack of the virus itself and please if I might, Steve and Jovita.
Jovita Carranza: (03:43)
Thank you. Thank you Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, Secretary Mnuchin, Ivanka Trump and all who I have been working closely with in this effort.
Jovita Carranza: (03:57)
Small business is the backbone of the American economy and the president has put the nation’s 30 million small businesses front and center in the response effort and we are working hard to get money to them quickly. This is an unprecedented effort by this administration to support small businesses and we know that there will be challenges in the process.
Jovita Carranza: (04:22)
Secretary Mnuchin and I are working in tandem to ensure that feedback from our partners is being heard and implemented. The private and public sector must work closely together to ensure that small businesses and their workers across the country are put first. This administration believes wholeheartedly that if you are a small business, you are a critical part of the economic fabric of this country and your viability is critical to the economic wellbeing of your employees.
Jovita Carranza: (04:54)
At SBA, we are working around the clock to support small businesses ensuring that we are prioritizing emergency capital for small businesses that are suffering economic harm as a result of this unprecedented situation. This relief will help stabilize a small business sector by providing businesses with the financial resources they need to keep their workers employed and keep up with their day-to-day operating expenses.
Jovita Carranza: (05:24)
Today I want to ensure that small businesses all over the country know about the paycheck protection program and how they can benefit from this. Simply put, the paycheck protection program is to help keep employees on payroll and small businesses open. SBA will forgive the portion of the loan that is used towards job retention and certain other expenses. We are working closely with lenders so that businesses can go directly to their local lenders. Paycheck protection program is in addition to substantial work that the SBA has and will continue to do to help small businesses including providing advances on SBA disaster loans and forgiving the existing SBA loan payments over the next six months.
Jovita Carranza: (06:13)
Additional details on these critically important programs can be found sba.gov and we will be updating these resources regularly. Our hearts go out to those affected by this terrible virus. Our communities around the country are stepping up and we will get through this together. At SBA, we know that every phone call, email, or application submitted has a small business owner, their employees and the communities they support around the other side. Our most important objective is to allow small businesses to keep their employees onboard and keep their businesses viable through this unprecedented disruption.
Jovita Carranza: (06:57)
I want to reiterate the importance of patience in this process as we work together to ensure that businesses are able to access needed credit. We will continue working around the clock as we’ve done with our federal and private sector partners, expanding capacity and working to make our systems as robust as possible to meet the needs. Thank you, Mr. President.
Steve Mnuchin: (07:25)
Thank you Mr. President. Thank you Mr. Vice President. Thank you, Jovita. Mr. President, you’ve made clear to us we now need to execute. We need to get money to small business and American workers and that’s what we’re doing. The SBA and Treasury committed to get this program up and running tomorrow and when Jovita says people working around the clock, they literally, we had both teams working till four o’clock in the morning and start working again today. We’ve heard feedback from lenders, community banks, regional banks, and we’ve spent the last 24 hours making this system even easier.
Steve Mnuchin: (07:59)
So this will be up and running tomorrow. I encourage all small businesses that have 500 or fewer people, please contact your lenders. Any FDIC institution will be able to do this. Any credit union, existing SBA lenders and FinTech lenders. You get the money, you’ll get it the same day, you use this to pay your workers. Please bring your workers back to work. If you’ve let them go, you have eight weeks plus overhead. This is a very important program. I’m pleased to announce we are going to raise the interest rate on these loans and, again, the interest rate is paid for as part of the program. The borrower doesn’t have to pay this to 1%. We had announced it was going to be 50 basis points. We’ve heard from some smaller community banks that their deposit costs, even though the government’s borrowing at three or four basis points, this is on average a 90 loan, to make this attractive for community banks, we’ve agreed to raise the interest rate. Again, I encourage everybody take out the paycheck protection program.
Steve Mnuchin: (09:05)
I’m also pleased to report the economic impact payments. I had previously said this would take us three weeks. I’m pleased to report that within two weeks the first payments will be direct deposit into taxpayer’s account, and as the president said last night, the president authorized me to say that anybody that has social security recipients won’t need to file a new tax return and will have that. If we don’t have your direct deposit information, we’ll be putting up a web portal so that you can put that up. It is a very large priority. The president has made clear we want to get this money quickly into your hands.
Steve Mnuchin: (09:44)
I’m also pleased to report that we continue to work closely with the Federal Reserve. We’re in the process of designing a new facility that we call the Main Street Lending Facility. We’re also looking at facilities for state governments as well. And I’m also pleased to report the employee retention credit. It’s up and running. The first $10,000 of wages, you get a 50% credit. That’s $5,000 per person. For everyone who’s kept someone, you can immediately get that money. You can deduct it from what you owe the IRS immediately. If you don’t know us money, you’ll get a refundable tax credit. So that is up and running. I’m also pleased to report we have the program up and running. We’re taking applications from the airlines, from the cargo companies and from national security companies. So thank you very much Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (10:33)
Thank you Steve. For Jovita or Steve, any questions?
Speaker 1: (10:35)
Mr. Secretary, Chase Bank sent a letter to its business clients today saying that they don’t have the necessary guidance from the SBA, from the Treasury Department to be able to accept loan applications starting tomorrow. The need is clearly enormous, but at least one major bank says they’re not fully empowered yet to be able to help there.
Steve Mnuchin: (10:55)
As I spoke to all the CEOs yesterday, I had a conference call with them. We got very good input from them on what they needed. As I said, people were working until four o’clock. I believe we just put up the federal register with the new guidelines for lenders. I’ve been assured that the banks will be in the process starting tomorrow. Now again, it’s going to take a little bit of time, but we committed that this will be available tomorrow and I encourage all companies, go to sba.com go to treasury.gov you can see the information you need immediately.
Speaker 2: (11:26)
Just to follow up with the small business owners. A number of them saying that they were on that conference call and that there’s a tremendous power struggle going on between the Treasury and SBA and that it’s over process and forms, is what they tell me that, lenders are actually opting out because they can’t make enough money to even service the loans. So how are you going to make sure these small business owners get the capital they need to survive right now?
Steve Mnuchin: (11:52)
First of all, I can assure you Jovita is here. Jovita used to work for me as the treasurer. There’s no power struggle. Jovita and our team, as I said, worked together until four o’clock in the morning, started working at seven o’clock again. We’ve made the form simpler and I can assure you at five points, I’ve told these bankers they should take older traders and put them in the branches. There’ll never be another opportunity to earn five points on a 90 day fully government guaranteed loan.
Speaker 2: (12:20)
And the checks right into direct deposit? IRS now saying it’d take four to five months. You’re saying two weeks-
Steve Mnuchin: (12:28)
Let me be clear. Let me be clear, I don’t know where you’re hearing these things. I told you this would be three weeks. I’m now committing to two weeks. We’re delivering on our commitments. The IRS, which I oversee, within two weeks the first money till be in people’s accounts.
Speaker 3: (12:42)
The problem is not about the first checks for folks who have direct deposit. Sounds like those will go up pretty quickly. The question is then for folks who don’t have direct deposit, and there was a staff memo that was released by the House Ways and Means Committee today saying that that process could take up to five weeks. That takes you to mid-August. Is that how long it’s going to take?
Steve Mnuchin: (12:59)
That is not going to take five… Again, let me just say, when Obama sent out these checks, it took months and months and months. I am assuring the American public they need the money now. What we’re going to do is, again, if we have your information, you’ll get it within two weeks. Social Security, you’ll get it very quickly after that. If we don’t have your information, you’ll have a simple web portal. You’ll upload it. If we don’t have that, we’ll send you checks in the mail.
Speaker 2: (13:29)
How many checks can you process a week, though? How many checks can you…
Steve Mnuchin: (13:29)
Again we can process a lot of checks, but we don’t want to send checks. In this environment, we don’t want people to get checks. We want to put money directly into their account.
Speaker 1: (13:37)
Thank you, Mr. Secretary. This is for, I guess both you and the administrator. There’ve been some anecdotal reports that business people are trying to get access to the online site to submit the applications. The website’s been crashing. I’ve heard of webinars going offline because there’s just too many people on them, so how are you guys going to be ready tomorrow to get these loans out?
Steve Mnuchin: (13:58)
We’ve brought in a lot of external resources at SBA and us to make sure there’s additional capacity. As I said, we heard a lot of good feedback yesterday to simplify this process. It’s going to be up and running now. Let me just be clear. That doesn’t mean everybody is going to get their loan tomorrow, but the system will be up and running. We encourage people over the next week. Sign up. You can go on right now. You can go on the web, see what information you need. Very simple process.
Speaker 4: (14:26)
Mr. Secretary, on a separate subject. Have you been in touch with Leader McConnell and Speaker Pelosi about their differences right now about another stimulus package?
Steve Mnuchin: (14:37)
I’ve spoken to the leader. I’ve spoken to the Speaker. I’ve spoken to the president constantly. When the president’s ready and thinks we should do the next stage, we’re ready. The president’s talked about the issue of infrastructure since the campaign. I think you know that’s a big priority for him. Again, if we run out of money on the small business program, we’ll be back right away to Congress to get this increased.
Speaker 2: (15:04)
Does the unemployment numbers today increase the urgency of doing a Phase three?
Steve Mnuchin: (15:07)
Well, let me just say, we’re going through something that we’ve never done before where the government has shut down big parts of the economy because of health reasons. Our economy was in great shape. Our companies were in great shape. There are three ways that Americans are going to be protected. For small business, they’ll get paid by their business through this program, the direct deposit. There’s also enhanced unemployment. So we realize unfortunately there are a lot of companies that because they aren’t in business over a short period of time, again, we’re working with the states on enhanced unemployment and as soon as the medical professionals and the president give the all clear, we’re going to have a ton of liquidity. We have about $6 trillion. This has never been done between us and the Fed to put into the economy to support American workers and American business.
Speaker 5: (15:59)
Mr. Secretary, in addition to the jobless numbers we saw today, phase three was signed before the social distancing guidelines were extended for another month. So what additional relief are you going to give to Americans as they stay out of work for all these extra weeks? What are you waiting for?
Steve Mnuchin: (16:20)
In designing this program, we thought that we had liquidity for about 10 weeks, and that’s what we’ve designed. And again, I think the president’s been very clear. If we need to go back to Congress to support the American economy and American workers, we will be doing that.
Speaker 6: (16:37)
Secretary Mnuchin, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has formed a select committee to oversee the distribution of recovery funds and she says she wants to make sure that those funds are wisely and efficiently spent. Do you think that select committee is something that’s necessary?
Steve Mnuchin: (16:52)
I don’t. Both parties wanted us to have oversight, wanted us to have transparency. We have full transparency. We have an oversight committee that the speaker gets to pick someone, the leader gets to pick someone. I believe there’s five people on it. And again, that that committee will review the money that we’re spending. And again, we support full transparency. Taxpayers should understand how we’re going to support this economy and jobs.
Speaker 7: (17:19)
Mr. Secretary. Senator Murkowski has asked you to consider providing loans to energy companies under the Cares Act, the phase three bill. What are your thoughts on that? Would you consider providing those loans to energy companies.
Steve Mnuchin: (17:33)
So thank you and let me clarify. I have very limited ability to do direct loans out of the Treasury. I can do them for passenger airlines, cargo airlines, contractors and national security companies. Outside of that, we work with the Federal Reserve to create broad-based lending facilities, which we will do. So our expectation is the energy companies like all our other companies will be able to participate in broad based facilities, whether it’s the corporate facility or whether it’s the Main Street facility, but not direct lending out of the treasury.
Speaker 1: (18:09)
A question for clarity about the direct payments to Americans. For those folks who don’t have bank accounts, who don’t have direct deposit information on file with the IRS, how long would they have to wait for their check?
Steve Mnuchin: (18:20)
For people who don’t have direct deposit, again we’ll have an easy way they put it up. We can on a rolling basis, I think, within a couple of days when they give it to us, we’ll send the money out. We do realize there are people who are under-banked. And again we’re working with all the digital companies, prepaid debit cards. We’re working with all of them to make sure we have a process that every American gets their money quickly. This money does people no good if it shows up in four months and we will deliver on that promise.
Speaker 1: (18:48)
So quickly is a matter of weeks then perhaps, not months?
Steve Mnuchin: (18:50)
Quickly as a matter of weeks and not months. That’s correct.
Speaker 8: (18:56)
Mr. Secretary, one area where you can make direct loans is to the airlines. How much do you expect that the treasury department and the federal government will be involved in overseeing the operations of airlines as it pertains to which routes get cut back, how much they operate, what they do about their employees and the like?
Steve Mnuchin: (19:17)
So there are very strict requirements that’s built into the bill. Again, this was a bipartisan requirement. One, anything we do with the airlines, they have to maintain substantially all of their employees. So again, any money that we provide them will go to pay their employees. We’re going to be working with the Secretary of Transportation. There are requirements to maintain certain routes. So again, we have a very clear process. We’ve hired three outside advisors, will be financial advisors and three law firms. We’ll be releasing that information shortly. And I want to thank them. They’re all working for basically very, very little money. They couldn’t work for free so they’ve agreed to basically work for what they would sign up to work for charitable organizations. So again, no big fees to bankers. We’ve got a great team of three lawyers and three financial advisors that will assist us.
Speaker 5: (20:07)
Just to follow up on that, will you give us a list of the names of those people who are advising you when you release the information?
Steve Mnuchin: (20:14)
Of course we will. We’ll give you the names as well as the contracts.
Speaker 5: (20:19)
Any names right now other than Black Rock?
Steve Mnuchin: (20:20)
So again, I’m happy to announce we have the PJT Partners is going to do the passenger airlines, Moelis and Company is going to do the cargo and contractors, and Perella Weinberg will handle the national security. And there’ll be three law firms which we’ll announce shortly that will be working in each one of those sectors. And again, let me just be clear, we need to get this done quickly. The airlines need money. We’re going to work very closely with the Department of Transportation and get this done quickly. We’ve actually already received contracts from a lot of the people. Again, there’s guidance up on the web. Full transparency. We’ve asked for applications.
Speaker 7: (20:59)
Mr. Secretary, on the airline issue again, Speaker Pelosi and others have said that the government taking stakes in those airlines should not be a condition for the federal government to provide payroll support specifically. What’s your response to that?
Steve Mnuchin: (21:14)
I spoke to the Speaker last night about that. This was something that was highly negotiated between the Republicans and the Democrats. The president was personally involved in this. He was on the phone with us many times. Mitch McConnell, Mark Meadows, senators on both sides. There is a specific line in the bill that says that the Secretary, meaning me, will determine proper compensation, so this is not a bail out for the airlines and I will be working, once we get our advice from our financial advisors, we get the applications from the airlines. I’ll be working very closely with the president and we’ll make sure that we strike the right balance. Not a bail out. Taxpayers get compensated. But these airlines, these are national security issues. We want to keep our airlines intact.
Speaker 4: (22:01)
Mr. Secretary, just more broadly perhaps for the administrator if not for you as well. Some small businesses, restaurant owners for example are finding that laying off their employees so that they can start collecting unemployment is better both for them as business owners and for their workers. What incentives do they have right now to keep their employees on the payroll if no one’s coming into their restaurant?
Steve Mnuchin: (22:26)
Well, the incentive that you have, and we want American business to be kept intact. The incentive is these are loans that turn into grants. So if you’re a business owner and you’re a restaurant, you can hire your people back. You get money for their medical, you keep them on the medical plan, you get money for your rent, you get money for your electricity, so you’re motivated. We want you to have a business that you can reopen quickly when it’s appropriate. So this doesn’t cost the business owners anything.
Steve Mnuchin: (22:57)
When people talk about it, I can’t imagine any American worker who had a job, is offered to keep their job isn’t going to want to have it. And let me just be clear, we’ve also talked about this unemployment issue. You can only get unemployment if you don’t have a job. So unemployment is intended for those people that are some of the mid-size or larger businesses and we’re very sympathetic to this, that these companies can’t afford, and for those people, the enhanced unemployment will be a significant benefit.
Steve Mnuchin: (23:28)
But we want to make sure 50% of the American workforce is small businesses under 500 people. The president, the vice president, the administrator and I want to make sure this part of the economy is ready and intact when we’re ready to reopen.
Speaker 1: (23:43)
A question for the administrator. Is there a certain category of small businesses that you’re most concerned about? Restaurants, hair salons, things like that?
Jovita Carranza: (23:52)
That’s a great question. We’re concerned about every small business. There’s 30 million small businesses that we’re really focused on and we’re working feverishly to make sure that we can provide the available funds to them as quickly as possible. So it’s 30 million small businesses and the other businesses are being dealt with with the PPP, with the paycheck protection. There was also the disaster, what call the economic injury disaster loans. And then there was an advance associated with that particular program as well.
Jovita Carranza: (24:23)
So to answer your question, we’re concerned about all businesses, and as the secretary indicated, we’re looking at employees being ready, not lost in this process. We want businesses to stay intact because they represent how half the GDP. So if we spend a trillion to support 10 trillion or 11 trillion, I think that’s a significant investment and that’s what we’re focused on.
Speaker 1: (24:50)
Is there a certain segment that you think is particularly vulnerable?
Steve Mnuchin: (24:54)
Hang on, I just want to make one comment for explanation because I want to make sure everybody out there understands this. If you’re an independent contractor, if you’re a sole proprietor, you’re eligible for this as well. Now that program won’t be up and running until next week. But again, this is a very broad definition of small business. So if you’re an independent plumber, if you’re an independent contractor, you’re covered under this program. Slightly more complicated, you have to come into your bank and give them more information. But starting next week that part of the program will be up and running. Also charities, charities as well. Very important. The vice president and president make sure that we covered small charities in this.
Speaker 2: (25:35)
[crosstalk 00:25:35] churches and religious nonprofits.
Steve Mnuchin: (25:38)
It does, although there are some technical issues, but yes, it does include faith organizations.
Speaker 2: (25:45)
Is that under the SBA program?
Steve Mnuchin: (25:47)
This is under the PPP yes, the new SBA program. They are covered. Thank you everybody.
Donald Trump: (25:54)
Thank you all.
Steve Mnuchin: (25:54)
Thank you everybody.
Donald Trump: (25:54)
Thank you, Steve. Good job. Thank you. Okay, so that begins right away and they start handing out checks, and a lot of people are going to have their businesses built back up quickly I hope. And we’ll see it. Complicated big small businesses, actually big business. So I thank them both. And please, we have some great gentlemen. Let me see, great gentlemen. That’s correct. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (26:26)
Today, my administration is also issuing new guidelines to protect elderly Americans who remain the most vulnerable. By now, nursing homes should have suspended the entry of all medically unnecessary personnel. Today we’re further recommending that all nursing home facilities assign the same staff to care for the same group of residents consistently to minimize any potential spread, and we’re also urging facilities to designate separate areas for healthy and sick residents. And this is a practice that we probably will be recommending into the future long after the enemy has gone, this particular enemy is gone.
Donald Trump: (27:07)
We’re also making every effort to provide relief to our great veterans. We take very good care of our veterans. At my direction Secretary Wilkie will use any authority at his disposal to extend deadlines for benefits and to postpone debt collections. We’re now conducting well over 100,000 coronavirus tests per day. It’s over 100,000 tests a day, and these are accurate tests and they’re moving rapidly, which is more than any other country in the world, both in terms of the raw number and also on a per capita basis the most.
Donald Trump: (27:47)
The FDA has also authorized the first coronavirus antibody test developed a body Cellex, a key step that will help identify people who have recovered and to understand their immune response and their immune system. Moments ago I directed Secretary Azar, and acting Secretary Wolf to use any and all available authority under the Defense Production Act to ensure that domestic manufacturers have the supplies they need to produce ventilators for patients with severe cases of C-O-V-I-D-19. You know what that is, right? Become a very famous term C-O-V-I-D. COVID.
Donald Trump: (28:29)
This action will help General Electric Hill-Rom, Medtronic, Resmed, Royal Phillips, and Vyaire Medical overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators. We have over 100,000 being built right now or soon to be started. We anticipate issuing more orders under the Defense Production Act in the very near future. In addition to the one that I’ve just signed against 3M for face masks, we just signed an element of the act against 3M and hopefully they’ll be able to do what they are supposed to do.
Donald Trump: (29:15)
Just spoke to Mary Barra of General Motors and she said they’re very soon going to be ready to start production of the ventilators. They have a lot of ventilators that they’ve committed to build, and they’ll be starting very, very quickly. FEMA continues to deliver resources to areas most effected by the virus, including New York. On top of the 3,000 beds we’re already providing to the Javits Center, the Department of Defense is adding another 48 ICU beds.
Donald Trump: (29:44)
Governor Cuomo has asked that this facility go and it’s a big beautiful facility. It’d be converted to a COVID hospital and we hadn’t done that yet. We hadn’t thought in terms of doing that, but their use is, their real demand is for that. And we had meetings on it with the task force. We had meetings with the military and I’ve decided to say, yes, I’m going to do that. That I will be signing and agreeing to a yes answer so that we will be doing that and also we will be staffing it so the federal government is doing a lot of things that wasn’t anticipated that it do. This is a 2,500 and/or 2,900, can easily be set up, hospital built in Javits Center. And so we’re going to be converting that to a COVID-19 hospital and it’s going to be a staffed by the military and by the federal government.
Donald Trump: (30:52)
And based on the fact that I agreed to that, we had two other facilities that will likewise asking for it and that would be in Louisiana and also in Dallas and we’ll be doing those. We spoke to the governor of Louisiana, spoke to the governor of Texas, and we’ve told them that we will be staffing those hospitals again above and beyond, but that’s okay. We have to do that. In addition to USNS Comfort is docked in New York to accept patients that is non-COVID.
Donald Trump: (31:27)
To date FEMA has delivered more than 4 million N95 mask respirators. Think of that, 4 million, 4 million. Don’t forget we’re a secondary source. The states are doing it and we’re backing them up, but we’ve gotten 4 million N95 respirators, 1.8 million surgical masks, 460,000 face shields, 1.4 million gloves and 4,400 ventilators just to the city and to the State of New York and some of them now are being sent. I spoke with both the Governor Cuomo and Mayor De Blasio a little while ago and some of them are being sent to the city.
Donald Trump: (32:11)
All of America stands with the people of New York in this time of need. It’s definitely a hot spot, but we have other hotspots also and we’re taking care of them very, very strongly, very powerfully. We have the finest people in the world in those locations and I think the federal government has not only acted early but acted quickly, professionally. There’s no people like this. Doctors, nurses, first responders and other healthcare providers who want to help New York at this critical time should visit website, nyc.gov/helpnow. Nyc.gov/helpnow. they need help now. They need people to help them.
Donald Trump: (32:56)
We have great facilities and we’ve built some brand new facilities, big ones, but we need help. We need help for professional people. So if you’re in an area that isn’t so affected, and you’re a doctor, a nurse, a health care worker, please get to that website and we would really appreciate your help. New York city needs it. Louisiana, by the way, needs it. Michigan needs it. Whatever you can do, those are very strong hotspots. They need help.
Donald Trump: (33:25)
In recent weeks, as the virus has spread and economic hardship has followed, we have seen Americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion. I want to remind everyone here in our nation’s capital, especially in Congress, that this is not the time for politics, endless partisan investigations. Here we go again. I’ve already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years. You see what happens. It’s a witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt and in the end the people doing the witch hunt have been losing and they’ve been losing by a lot, and it’s not any time for witch hunts, it’s time to get this enemy defeated. Conducting these partisan investigations in the middle of a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resources, time, attention, and we want to fight for American lives, not waste time and build up my poll numbers cause that’s all they’re doing. Because everyone knows it’s ridiculous.
Donald Trump: (34:29)
So we want to focus on the people of this country, even the people of the world, we’re going to be able to help them because right now, as an example, we’re building so many ventilators, very, very hard to build, but we’re building thousands, thousands of them and a lot of them will be coming at a time where we won’t need them as badly because it takes time. Very complex, very expensive. And we’ll be able to help outside of our country. We think we’ll be able to help. That’s something that you cannot easily produce. As citizens we’re linked together by the shared bonds of national love, loyalty, and affection.
Donald Trump: (35:03)
We’re linked together by the shared bonds of national love, loyalty, and affection. There’s no earthly force more powerful than the patriotic pride that stirs in our hearts. And that is so true.
Donald Trump: (35:10)
It’s incredible the job that everybody’s been doing. Everybody. They don’t sleep. They don’t go to bed. Sometimes they get nothing. Said to somebody recently on the task force, how many hours sleep have you gotten over the last couple of days? The answer was none. None.
Donald Trump: (35:28)
In one Massachusetts neighborhood citizens come out of their homes each night at eight o’clock from their porches and they sing God Bless America. Others have joined in spreading from house to house down one street up to the next until their little town with a spirit of patriotism and reminding all Americans that we’re all in this together. We’ll fight together and we will win together. We’re going to win this.
Donald Trump: (35:53)
Now what I’d like to do is I’m going to step out.
Donald Trump: (35:56)
We have a meeting on the subject and I’m going to step out just for a few moments. I’ll be right back. We’ll answer some questions. But you have some very hardworking people who have done an incredible job led by Vice President Mike Pence, head of the task force. And then Jared Kushner is going to say a few words and Admiral [Polowczyk 00:01:17], Peter Navarro, Dr. Birx and myself.
Donald Trump: (36:21)
I’ll be right back. So I’ll see you in a little while. I did take a test. It just came out. This is from the white house physician. It just came out. I just took it this morning. And I took it. It took me literally a minute to take it and it took me, I guess it was 14 or 15 minutes. I went to work. I didn’t wait for it, but he said it took 14 minutes or something to come up with a conclusion and it said the President tested negative for COVID 19.
Donald Trump: (36:52)
So that’s the second one. I think I took it really out of curiosity to see how quickly it worked and fast it worked and it’s a lot easier. I’ve done them both. And the second one is much more pleasant, Jeff, I can tell you that. Much more pleasant.
Donald Trump: (37:04)
So I’ll be back in a little while and Mike please take over. Thank you. Thank you all very much. I’ll be right back.
Mike Pence: (37:14)
Thank you Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met today, but earlier in the day the President convened all the key elements of our supply chain team in the oval office for an update on the progress that we’ve been making working literally around the clock to make sure that our healthcare workers, the people on the front lines have the personal protective equipment and also the ventilators to be able to meet this moment. And today you’re going to hear from the people that are literally working. Working each and every day to make that happen.
Mike Pence: (37:54)
Dr Deborah Birx is also with us. She’ll reflect in a few moments on the progress that we’re making analyzing the data. Each and every day we’re looking county by county, state by state consulting with governors and local health officials.
Mike Pence: (38:12)
At the present moment more than 1.3 million tests have been performed, and as you all are aware, some 236,000 Americans have tested positive for the coronavirus. With now the losses over 5,000 Americans and our hearts are with their families. Beyond that, we have been focusing not just on ensuring the testing is occurring, but that the supplies are flowing. As the President just announced, he made a decision today to deploy thousands of N95 masks directly to New York city’s public hospitals. And our team will speak about that in just a moment.
Mike Pence: (38:51)
And also the President took the unprecedented step to direct the department of defense to use military healthcare personnel to operate all COVID facilities at the Javits Center in New York, at the convention center in New Orleans and at the convention center in Dallas. And we’ve informed each of the governors of those States today that their requests, we were making those military medical personnel available to operate in all COVID facility.
Mike Pence: (39:23)
But we would emphasize to people in that community who believe you’ve been impacted or have contracted to coronavirus contact your local healthcare provider. We anticipate in the New York area that your local healthcare provider will make the decision whether you are transferred to the Javits center. And in all cases, simply look to the guidance of your local governors about how best to receive the care that every American is entitled to have.
Mike Pence: (39:55)
Beyond that, let me say that we have been working through FEMA’s acquisition process, not only to deploy but to gather up personal protective equipment. And in just a few moments you will hear from Admiral John Polowczyk about the extraordinary progress that we have made in deploying not just the strategic national stockpile, but also in identifying on the commercial marketplace around America and around the world literally millions of N95 masks, surgical gowns, gloves, protective equipment. And at this point we’ve distributed some 7,600 ventilators. And you’ll hear today specifically about the States that have received those ventilators.
Mike Pence: (40:43)
This team is truly acted in an inspiring way. And literally is working with dozens and dozens of people at the FEMA stabilization task force to make sure that we are leaving no stone unturned to find the supplies we need.
Mike Pence: (40:58)
Let me also say today you’re going to hear from Jared Kushner, a Senior Advisor to the President of the United States, but someone that the White House Coronavirus Task Force directed to work with FEMA on supply chain issues. And in recent weeks he’s been leading a working group in conjunction with FEMA that literally has identified millions of medical supplies around the nation, and around the world, and we’re grateful for his efforts and his leadership. Finally, you’ll hear from Peter Navarro who will explain the action the President took today using the Defense Production Act.
Mike Pence: (41:37)
But as you hear details today about medical supplies that have been distributed, those that have been purchased, those that we’re making available ventilators distributed to hospitals and those that are available, let me just remind every American that you can make a difference in ensuring that every patient has the treatment that they deserve. Every healthcare provider, every doctor and nurse and nurse’s assistant has the protective gear to provide the care that you would want your family to have by putting into practice, the President’s 30 days To Slow The Spread. I mean we want you to take to heart the President’s Coronavirus Guidelines for America.
Mike Pence: (42:20)
First, to protect your own health, to protect the health of your family, to protect the health of your community. We know so many people are asymptomatic. And people that literally don’t know they have the Coronavirus but have the ability to infect others. We want you to put these guidelines into practice. Social distancing, using a drive through at a restaurant, washing your hands on a regular basis.
Mike Pence: (42:42)
But as we focus today on supplies, make no mistake about it. Every American can make sure that our health care workers and more importantly Americans that are struggling with Corona virus have the equipment to support their treatment by putting these principles into practice. Because the fewer Americans that contract the Coronavirus, the fewer Americans will have to enter our healthcare system. And that’ll continue to preserve the capacity in our healthcare economy.
Mike Pence: (43:12)
So we thank the millions of Americans who’ve responded in the first two days of 30 Days To Slow The Spread. And I’m just absolutely confident that in the days ahead, every American’s going to do their part for your health, your family’s health, the health of your community, and to ensure the strength and vitality of the greatest healthcare system in the world.
Mike Pence: (43:33)
With that, let me introduce a Jared Kushner to speak about the work that he’s been doing, working with FEMA on ensuring a strong supply chain to meet this moment. Jared.
Jared Kushner: (43:47)
Thank you Mr. Vice President. And thank you for your great leadership on the task force. And thank you to Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci as well. It’s been an honor working with you these past few weeks.
Jared Kushner: (43:57)
When the Vice President first asked me to help on the task force with different tasks, I asked the President what he expected from the task force and how I can best serve him in the task force. What the President asked is that all of the recommendations that we make be based on data. He wanted us to be very rigorous to make sure that we were studying the data, collecting data. A lot of things in this country were happening very quickly and we want to make sure that we were trying to keep updating our models and making sure that we were making informed decisions and informed recommendations to him based on the data that we were able to collect and put together.
Jared Kushner: (44:29)
The President wanted to make sure that we had the best people doing the best jobs and making sure that we had the right people focused on all the things that needed to happen to make sure that we can deliver in these unusual times for the American people.
Jared Kushner: (44:42)
The President also instructed me to make sure that I break down every barrier needed to make sure that the teams can succeed. This is an effort where the government is doing things that the government doesn’t normally do. We’re stretching. We’re acting very quickly and the President wants to make sure that the white house is fully behind the different people running the different lines of effort to make sure that we get everything done in a speed that the President demands.
Jared Kushner: (45:06)
The President also wanted us to make sure we think outside the box. Make sure we’re finding all the best thinkers in the country. Making sure we’re getting all the best ideas and that we’re doing everything possible to make sure that we can keep Americans safe. And make sure we bring a quick end to this in the best way possible and balance all the different aspects that need to be thought of while we do this.
Jared Kushner: (45:26)
This truly is a historic challenge. We have not seen something like this in a very, very long time. But I am very confident that by bringing innovative solutions to these hard problems we will make progress.
Jared Kushner: (45:39)
Today we were briefing the President earlier he asked me to come out and talk a little bit about what we are doing on the supply chain task force which Admiral Polowczyk has been leading and what he’s been very impressed by is the way that we’ve been resourceful to find product all over the world, all over the country. And we are finding ways to solve the different problems.
Jared Kushner: (45:57)
The President’s been very, very hands on in this. He’s really instructed us to leave no stone unturned. Just very early this morning, I got a call from the President. He told me he was hearing from friends of his in New York that the New York Public Hospital System was running low on critical supply. He instructed me this morning, I called Dr Katz who runs the system.
Jared Kushner: (46:17)
I asked him which supply was the most supply he was nervous about. He told me it was the N95 masks. I asked what his daily burn was and I basically got that number. Called up Admiral Polowczyk. Made sure that we had the inventory. We went to the President today and earlier today the President called Mayor de Blasio to inform him that we were going to send a month of supply to New York Public Hospital System to make sure that the workers on the front line can rest assured that they have the N95 masks that they need to get through the next month. We’ll be doing similar things with all the different public hospitals that are in the hotspot zones and making sure that we’re constantly in communications with the local communities.
Jared Kushner: (46:56)
One thing I will say just based on data is that we’ve been getting a lot of data from different governors and from different mayors and from different cities. One thing I’ve seen FEMA do very, very well over the last week or so is now we’re getting real time data from a lot of cities. People who have requests for different products and supplies. A lot of them are doing it based on projections, which are not the realistic projections. The projections change every day as we see the cases, as we see the impacts of The Stop Spread effort that this task force recommended and the President has been pushing forward.
Jared Kushner: (47:28)
So I do think that we’ll see that hopefully there’ll be impact of that and the task force has been working very hard through the FEMA group with Admiral Polowczyk to make sure that we’re getting the supplies to people before they run out and making sure that we’re doing it in a proper way.
Jared Kushner: (47:43)
I’d like to just introduce Admiral Polowczyk who before coming to this I guess still is, he’s the Vice Director For Logistics for the Joint Staff. I got a call from one of the senators saying, well, why don’t you put a great military person in charge of the logistics and the supply chain and the Defense Production Act? And I said, well, the President already did that. This is the best man that we have in the country for supplies and logistics. He joined the task force 13 days ago over at FEMA and he’s built a team really at the direction of the Vice President that includes people from FEMA, OMB, the FDA, HHS, The White House, and from everywhere else.
Jared Kushner: (48:17)
And what they’ve done over the last 13 days has been really extraordinary. We’ve done things that the government has never done before, quicker than they’ve ever done it before. And what we’re seeing now is we found a lot of supplies in the country. We’ve been distributing them where we anticipate there will be needs and also trying to make sure that we’re hitting places where there are needs.
Jared Kushner: (48:33)
So I can tell you the people in the task force, they’re working day and night. You’ve got a lot of people in the government. We recognize the challenge that America faces right now. We know what a lot of the people on the front lines are facing, the fear that they had that they won’t have the supplies they need. And our goal is to work as hard as we can to make sure that we don’t let them down.
Jared Kushner: (48:52)
So I just want to thank everybody and with that I’ll introduce Admiral Polowczyk who’s doing an amazing job.
Admiral Polowczyk: (49:00)
Thank you Mr. Kushner, Mr. Vice President. So today I’m going to cover a couple items. A couple of five things.
Admiral Polowczyk: (49:08)
First thing I want to talk about is resources pushed out from the federal government. And then I’m going to talk about this Air Bridge, which you may have heard about. I’m going to talk about data as you said, Mr. Kushner is absolutely right. We’re trying to be data driven. And then I’m going to talk a little bit about how we’re trying to expand the industrial base here to meet this challenge.
Admiral Polowczyk: (49:36)
So the first thing I want to talk about is surgical masks. So you’ve quickly stated numbers here. So I’m about to go through several different slides to give you just scale and magnitude federal resources that have been applied at the problem. So 27.1 million surgical masks pushed out to state governments. For N95 masks, 19.5 million N95 masks.
Admiral Polowczyk: (50:10)
And so if I was in a local hospital that was running short, I would look upward because the federal government has pushed out resources. So for protective gloves, 22.4 million pairs of protective gloves. For face shields, 5.2 million face shields. For ventilator we have pushed to the States more than 7,600 ventilators and I think as I was coming over here, that number has changed slightly. I think it’s now 7,640 given to predominantly these States. So we wanted you to have some numbers.
Admiral Polowczyk: (51:01)
Now as we’ve indicated, we had ventilators in the national stockpile. We pushed ventilators out. We’re holding ventilators to put to the point to need. But we’re also buying ventilators, asking the industrial base who produces prior to COVID, approximately 30,000 ventilators a year. We are going to over the next several months, by the end of June work to acquire a hundred thousand.
Admiral Polowczyk: (51:37)
And so one of the tools that I can anticipate needing, we’ve already executed is all of those vendors that we’re buying them from potentially will need help in their supply chains with their suppliers. We might rate orders, we might help them get ahead of others in that endeavor. So I think Mr. Navarro is going to talk a little bit more on that later.
Admiral Polowczyk: (52:05)
So let me talk about the Airbridge. So it normally takes approximately 37 days to get from overseas, get product, load it, get it to the United States and distribute it. That’s about 37 days. So to prime the pump, so to speak, we have lined on an Airbridge to get product here faster. Working with our major suppliers as they work to fill orders to get more to health care workers now. We are working to align transportation to product.
Admiral Polowczyk: (52:52)
And one of the things we’re also doing is the team that works for me are scouring the globe and finding pockets of personal protective equipment that might not otherwise be in the US hospital supply chain. That is also going on these flights. Six completed and a number scheduled. 28 flights scheduled here in the near future. Where we are working towards some days we’ll have one flight, some days that might be two flights, multiple flights over the next coming days.
Admiral Polowczyk: (53:27)
These 28 or as far as I can see out a couple of weeks. Then again, matching product to flights to create volume in the supply chain here faster than the 37 days. I’m just going to leave that up as I talk about a few other items.
Admiral Polowczyk: (53:49)
So let’s talk about New York city and the public health hospitals. I believe they’re called New York City Health and Hospitals. President directed, as I speak there are pallets being formed, a truck being loaded. I gave an address in New York City here an hour or two ago and one of our distributors is making that happen and that delivery will happen tomorrow.
Admiral Polowczyk: (54:24)
On the data front. This is almost unprecedented. This is a commercial supply chain with six to seven major distributors of health equipment. We brought them all in and we said, we need to make informed decisions and we are going to help make informed allocation decisions. So within the matter of days feeding from their business systems, their enterprise resource like systems, I brought onboard a tool, a supply chain tower that the DOD was using to manage a supply chain for a very complex weapon system. Their data goes into a data link. We have a tool to be able to use their data and see it. I can tell what product is coming in. What their orders are, what they’re filling, what they’re not filling and see the volume in the supply chain and understand what they’re doing down to the county level. We’re working to get it potentially down to the hospital level.
Admiral Polowczyk: (55:34)
So this 200 and some odd N95 respirators. We took a look in there in the supply chain we said we have the volume to go do that. I called the distributor and they’re making that happen. We anticipate as the hotspots around the country, we anticipate these vendors at our direction, helping them allocate product to the right place at the right time.
Admiral Polowczyk: (56:05)
So if I talk finally about expanding the industrial base. So the Vice President was at Walmart the other day who told him, I want to get in this game, how do I do that? So I got the call. We provided them specifications and Walmart is going to use their suppliers to cut fabric, make gowns, sew product. But that’s not always the case. We have lots of folks that want to help. I believe you will see in the coming days the use of the Defense Production Act in creative ways to help people that are not doing this today to do it.
Admiral Polowczyk: (56:44)
We have essentially leads. The number yesterday was 210 I believe, it probably grew today, that we are working with to find how each one of those might need help to get in the game that’s not in the game to increase the throughput through the healthcare market.
Admiral Polowczyk: (57:06)
Again, the President gave me one task, get more to our healthcare workers now. And I took that to heart because not that I don’t need that from the President that direction to move out, but I have family in New York. My sister’s a nurse practitioner in a Westchester Hospital and my niece is a nurse on a Long Island Hospital and I have other health care professionals in the family. So I have skin in this game. The President asked me to get more to the healthcare workers. I’m going to get more to healthcare workers. Like to hand over to Mr. Navarro.
Mike Pence: (57:46)
[inaudible 00:57:49].
Admiral Polowczyk: (57:46)
The 200,000 is going out as we speak.
Mike Pence: (57:53)
Be very specific about that.
Admiral Polowczyk: (57:55)
It’ll be delivered tomorrow.
Speaker 9: (57:59)
Can I ask a question?
Mike Pence: (58:00)
Let me help me be clear on it if I can, what the Jared announced what the Admiral just unpacked is that pallets are being loaded right now to send 200,000 N95 masks to New York City to the public health hospitals.
Admiral Polowczyk: (58:15)
To the Public Health Warehouse in New York City.
Mike Pence: (58:17)
All the healthcare workers help us on the way.
Speaker 9: (58:21)
Based on the tools and the data you have available to you, where is the log jam? Where has it been? How have you identified that? Because as we say all of this, we have millions more PPE is going out the door, as you well know are front line on-
Admiral Polowczyk: (58:37)
I’m going to answer you this way. We put up a lot of numbers. I said that if you’re a hospital and you’re not seeing PPE, I would up to the state level first.
Speaker 10: (58:46)
We are hearing from governors. They are saying they can’t get the medical equipment that they need.
Speaker 11: (58:52)
And the reason for that is because according to governors and also by the fact that we haven’t seen any numbers up there about what is going to the private sector. Can you tell us what percentage of the supplies on these large cargo planes are going to private companies versus FEMA versus the States? Is it 80% ?
Admiral Polowczyk: (59:13)
So this product that we’re moving is primarily a commercial product that would enter the commercial system and be distributed through a financial business transactions between hospitals and these distributors.
Speaker 11: (59:33)
So just to clarify that explains why States say they’re bidding like they’re on eBay because the supplies are going to the private sector and then they have to go there to get the supplies.
Admiral Polowczyk: (59:46)
So that’s normally how things work, right? So I’m not here to disrupt a supply chain. Say look these six distributors, six, seven, they have six to 700 warehouses. They have trucks to go to the hospital door every day. We’re bringing product in. They’re filling orders for hospitals, nursing homes, like normal. I’m putting volume into that system.
Admiral Polowczyk: (01:00:22)
So we put together this data element over the last 13 days. Get the people in, look at the problem, build this. I am now seeing truth about what’s in the supply chain and I would say that there’s been some abnormal behavior. Okay.
Speaker 9: (01:00:44)
Thank you Admiral. House Oversight Committee Democrats say the FEMA officials told them that the ventilators the government has ordered won’t be ready until June, which is well after the expected peak. Will the Defense Production Act memo signed today do anything to speed that up?
Admiral Polowczyk: (01:00:59)
Yeah, so we’ll have Mr. Navarro talk about that. We’re online to receive several thousand ventilators in the month of April and several thousand more ventilators in the month of May ramping up to a big number in June. Again, going from an industry that produces about 30,000 annually to a very big number.
Speaker 10: (01:01:18)
Are you confident that the system means the States with the greatest need are getting the supplies? A lot of donors are saying that they can’t get what they need and different States have more and more pressing urgency. Obviously, depending on the case load.
Admiral Polowczyk: (01:01:33)
So we’re marrying up where CDC, where the demand for COVID is to what’s in the commercial system. We’re providing that to the commercial system and we are making allocations to those of most pressing need. 13 days. We now have the data. We now can make informed decisions. And so all of the I need, I need, I need, I now know the volume that has been happening and needs to be happening.
Speaker 12: (01:02:11)
So Admiral, with that, and Mr. President I’d love for you to weigh in on this as well. Well you alluded to the fact that there is possibly some shady business going on, that the product is here in the United States.
Donald Trump: (01:02:25)
And coming here.
Speaker 12: (01:02:25)
And yes, and it is coming here. It’s coming from China, it’s in warehouses, it’s being made here in the United States. It’s in warehouses. But it’s going to the highest bidder. So what can be done to keep those products here in the United States, not go overseas where companies are making a lot of money.
Admiral Polowczyk: (01:02:44)
[crosstalk 01:02:44] Yeah, I’m going to let Mr. Navarro talk about that.
Speaker 12: (01:02:44)
And and get it distributed to the most critical places here in the US.
Admiral Polowczyk: (01:02:50)
[crosstalk 01:02:50] When the time comes. We are-
Speaker 12: (01:02:53)
How’s that being done because doctors, I’ve talked to surgeons on a regular basis.
Peter Navarro: (01:02:57)
[crosstalk 01:02:57] Great question. Let me give you the bigger view of the DPA and we’ll directly address that. What we have essentially is a nation at war. We have a wartime President standing behind me. The Defense Production Act is one of the most powerful weapons this administration can use to fight the invisible enemy of the virus.
Peter Navarro: (01:03:17)
When I spoke with you last week, I explained the three points of the compass DPA can be used to hit. The first one is mobilization of the industrial base. This can involve things like re- purposing from say a distiller like Pernod Ricad from liquor to hand sanitizer. It can also involve expansion of production, which is having Honeywell, which makes N95 masks open new factory in Smithfield, Rhode Island.
Peter Navarro: (01:03:47)
With respect to the second point of the compass, allocation of resources, we have two issues there. If you look at the manufacturer itself, you what you want to make sure is that the supply chain, which can go seven tiers deep, has enough components in that supply chain so we can actually make what we need and then once it’s made, you also want to make sure that it goes to the right people.
Peter Navarro: (01:04:10)
And then the third point in the compass, which addresses what you’re talking about is, is basically Bust Them, I call it. Hoarding of critical or threatened materials. So let me walk through what the President did today in terms of a strong action in what we’ve done with the DPA across those three points.
Peter Navarro: (01:04:29)
The first order President Trump signed was vigorous, swift. It was the GM order which directed GM to make ventilators in Kokomo, Indiana in Trump time, which is to say as fast as possible. As the President mentioned, he’d spoke to Mary Barr today, the CEO of GM. That is moving forward at the same time as the Ford project is moving forward in a Rawsonville, Michigan. And I’ve issued a challenge to those two companies out of Ford versus Ferrari. This is Ford versus GM. Let’s see who gets those ventilators out first.
Peter Navarro: (01:05:01)
Now, the second point of the compass, which these two orders address today is this allocation of resource issues. The ventilator companies themselves express concern that in this rush to build ventilators, there would be pressure on that supply chain. So what they requested that we do and the President do, is to use the DPA to give this gentleman here, is one of the strongest gentleman in the world in terms of applying things, is to give him the ability to prioritize that supply chain for those ventilator manufacturers. And he will do things like give them what’s called a DO rating in the defense procurement, which will allow them to get what they need.
Peter Navarro: (01:05:43)
Now, the second order, which the President signed today has to do with the other part of the equation, which is once they make the stuff, okay, does it go to the right folks? And this is a 3m order. And, to be frank, over the last several days, we’ve had some issues making sure that all of the production that 3m does around the world, enough of it is coming back here to the right places. So what’s going to happen with the signing of that order in Trump time is we’re going to resolve that issue with 3m probably by tomorrow close of business. Because we can’t afford to lose days or hours or even minutes in this crisis.
Peter Navarro: (01:06:29)
Now the third part of the compass, this third point there, this gets to the hoarding issue. President stood up here, he’s the Commander In Chief, but we have a sheriff in town too, Attorney General Barr. And he stood up here with Attorney General Barr and Bill Barr said, “I’m going to go out and bust them.” And guess what? Three days ago DOJ went into a warehouse in Jersey, grabbed PPE and the beauty of that was it wasn’t only seized, but within hours it was turned around and given to healthcare professionals in New York and New Jersey. That’s a beautiful thing. That’s a beautiful case of using the DPA.
Peter Navarro: (01:07:11)
Now what’s going to happen tomorrow is President’s going to sign another order which is in the works. This is interesting. There is a black market springing up, which you have described where we’re having people bid against each other. Brokers come in. They’re bidding and bidding on all this different PPE. It’s driving the price up and guess what? You know where it’s going? The domestic sources here are being exported.
Speaker 12: (01:07:39)
[crosstalk 01:07:39] That’s what [inaudible 01:07:41] told me.
Peter Navarro: (01:07:41)
When President Trump heard about that, he said that’s not going to happen anymore on my watch. So tomorrow we’re bringing that order and what it’s going to do is it’s going to empower Customs and Border Protection with the help of people like the Post Office and express mail consignors like UPS to basically deal with that issue.
Peter Navarro: (01:08:01)
So we are going to crack down unmercifully and I would say to the hoarders out there and the brokers who are trying to make money off of the misery of people in this country around the world. That’s got to stop. If you’ve got inventory, what you need to do is pick up a phone and not call somebody out around the world. You call FEMA and say we got some stuff. We’ll give it to you at a fair price and be done with that. Because that stuff has absolutely got to stop. So that’s-
Speaker 12: (01:08:27)
[inaudible 00:33:30].
Peter Navarro: (01:08:27)
Hang on. Hang on. So that’s what we’re going to be looking for and when we hear cases like this we are going to aggressively issue order after order to crack down on it.
Peter Navarro: (01:08:37)
Now before, this is not my role to take a bunch of questions but let me tell you one other thing before I leave the podium. It’s a story which I’d love to share with you today. Because, this again illustrates one of the key principles of this President and this this Vice President, which is the wed, the full force of the federal government with the full power of private enterprise.
Peter Navarro: (01:08:59)
And just two days ago we at The White House got an urgent SOS from the Chief Of Police of the New York Police Department and they are in a situation now because of the strain on their resources where personnel such as their homicide detectives were having to go on into houses and deal with COVID issues without protective gear. Now, the beauty of this President is because of his leadership, we were able to solve that problem in two phone calls. Two phone calls. The first one went to Phebe Novakovic at General Dynamics. Phoebe, can you call Tom Kennedy at Raytheon? I need you guys to basically scoop up all the tyvek suits you can and find any gloves you can.
Peter Navarro: (01:09:47)
This President under his leadership and that voluntary efforts and the pride and patriotism you talked about earlier that we had 4,000 Tyvec suits delivered to the New York PD within 16 hours. That’s a new record.
Peter Navarro: (01:10:03)
New York PD within 16 hours. That’s a new record in Trump time. At the same time, a second phone call was made to Tara Engle at Pernod Ricard and Laura Lane at UPS. They were on the same phone call and I said, “Tara, Laura, we got this issue. They need hand sanitizer.” Literally within two hours we had 50 gallon drums, 6,000 gallons of hand sanitizer on a UPS truck heading up to the NYPD and it probably arrived today with a promise from Pernod that they will continue to supply the MYPD throughout the course of this crisis. So this is a beautiful thing that America is rallying to. We are becoming a stronger, more United nation and I couldn’t be more proud of this president, this administration.
Peter Navarro: (01:10:50)
These guys up here are doing a heck of a job organizing the supply chain. And my promise to you is that the president is going to use that DPA to make sure that the American people, particularly our healthcare professionals, get the PPE, the medicines, everything we need. So let me stop there. I don’t think it’s my place here to the field a bunch of questions [crosstalk 01:11:14].
Donald Trump: (01:11:13)
[crosstalk 01:11:13] You did a good job, thank you.
Journalist 1: (01:11:15)
[crosstalk 01:11:15] by American executive order?
Donald Trump: (01:11:18)
Go ahead. Go ahead, answer. You go ahead. Come here. Com here.
Peter Navarro: (01:11:26)
One of the things that this crisis has taught us, sir, is that we are dangerously overdependent on a global supply chain for our medicines like penicillin, our medical supplies like masks and our medical equipment like ventilators. We have right now as we speak, over 50 countries have already imposed some forms of export restrictions in their country against the rest of the world. And what we’re learning from that is that no matter how many treaties you have, no matter how many alliances, no matter how many phone calls, when push comes to shove, you run the risk as a nation of not having what you need and if there’s any vindication of the president’s by American secure borders and a strong manufacturing base philosophy, strategy and belief it is this crisis because it underscores everything that we see there.
Peter Navarro: (01:12:31)
So the “By American” order which is going through process, would do a couple things. It would simply say, not during this crisis because we don’t want to disrupt anything, I want to be really clear about that. But going forward after this is over the VA, DOD, HHS and this government, buys American for essential medicines, our medical countermeasures and the medical supplies and equipment we need. At the same time it will deregulate so we can get the FDA and EPA to facilitate domestic manufacturing and then innovate because the key here is having advanced manufacturing on U.S. Soil that can leapfrog other countries so we don’t have to worry about competing against cheap sweatshop labor, lacks environmental regulations, different tax regimes and the massive subsidies of foreign governments who are actually directly attacking our industrial base. So be patient with that, sir. The other priorities we have right now are the DPA and what the task force is doing. But if we learn anything from this crisis, it should be never again should we have to depend on the rest of the world for our essential medicines and counter measures.
Donald Trump: (01:13:51)
And by the way, we’ve cut them out also to be honest. We’ve stopped orders going from certain places and… In a couple of places we had a big order going to Italy on important outfits and some ventilators and it was going to Italy. They made the order a long time ago and I said, “You got to let it go.” They’ve had an order and I could have cut it under the act. I could have cut it. I said, “Nope, can’t do that. You’ve got to let it go.” They have big problems. We had an order going to Spain and I said, “Let it go.” I could have stopped it. I said, “Let it go. We’re going to be fine.” I said, “Let it go.” So it works that way also.
Donald Trump: (01:14:27)
One other thing that’s to your question, oftentimes, and we’ve told this to the governors, Mike, we’ve been very strong on this. If you think there’s bidding between federal government and state, let us know and we’ll drop out immediately or you drop out and we lower the price… [crosstalk 00:04:46].
Journalist 2: (01:14:45)
[crosstalk 01:14:45] bidding against each other?
Donald Trump: (01:14:45)
No. No. If we’re bidding against each other I said find out who it is. And usually they know, everyone knows and we’re notified and we get notified and we’ll either drop out or they’ll drop out. But we have another problem. There are 151 countries out there beyond the States. There are 151 countries that have this problem and they’re ordering, too. It’s really a mess [crosstalk 01:15:09] Now in a little while the hardest thing to get are the ventilators because it takes a while to build them and we have thousands of them being built right now. In a little while they’ll be worth about $5 but right now they’re very valuable and we’re going to have a lot of them being shipped. In fact, that’s why General Motors called up before, Mary. That’s why others called up two days ago. They called up that they’re all in production and they’re starting to arrive in a week and a half, but there’ll be a time when we’re going to build stockpiles.
Donald Trump: (01:15:41)
By the way, the States should have been building their stockpile. We have almost 10,000 and our stockpile and we’ve been building it and we’ve been supplying it, but the States should be building. We’re a backup. We’re not an ordering clerk. We’re a back up and we’ve done an unbelievable job. Like for instance, whoever heard of a governor calling up, ” Sir, can you build us a hospital of 2,500 rooms?” And we built it. “Can you build us four medical centers?” We built it. “Can you deliver a ship, a hospital ship with a thousand rooms?” And we did it and we did it in Los Angeles, too. We’ve been unbelief. We’ve done an unbelievable job… These people and thousands of people behind them, but we’re a backup. Ideally those hospitals would have had all this equipment. Ideally those States should have had all this equipment and I think they will the next time.
Donald Trump: (01:16:32)
You heard the case where thousands of ventilators could have been had at a very inexpensive price three years ago and a certain state decided not to exercise that right because they wanted to build a road or they wanted to build something else because it’s big money. You’re talking about, I think it was $1 billion, but you’re talking about a lot of money for something that may never happen. Because normally on a ventilator other than a pandemic or an epidemic, you wouldn’t need anything like this. Hospitals have three ventilators, big hospitals, and they get by with it. And now they want thousands. I mean they want thousands of ventilators. You call up a governor and they’ll say, “Sir, could you send us 40,000 ventilators?” Nobody has ever heard of a thing like this. So they’ve done some job. Let me just tell you when secretary Mnuchin spoke, they want you to call not .com but sba.gov, okay? For the application and for information, okay? So it’s SBA, small business, sba.gov, okay? If you don’t mind. Yeah, let’s go, please…
Journalist 3: (01:17:40)
Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to follow up from a question yesterday regarding your administration’s denial of the expansion Obamacare special enrollment period in the wake of this pandemic. In your own words, VP Pence gave a five minute a non answer, but people facing this pandemic illness and even worse, most experts say that having healthcare is critical to our nation’s health and financial wellbeing. Can you assure Americans tonight that you will reopen Obamacare marketplace so that they can be covered in this time of combined health and financial crisis?
Donald Trump: (01:18:10)
Yeah. I understand the question and we’re doing better than that. We’re going to try and get a cash payment to the people and we’re working out the mechanics of that with legislature, so we’re going to try and get them a cash payment because just opening it up doesn’t help as much. So we’re going to work it out so we’re going to try and get for that certain group of people… It’s a certain group of people, a cash payment.
Journalist 2: (01:18:36)
I really want to ask you about masks, but I also just meant to follow up on a couple of hanging threads there. Just the question earlier about the bidding. What happens though when States are bidding against each other on those markets?
Donald Trump: (01:18:47)
Well, they have that and they have to work that out. What they should do is they should have, long before this pandemic arrived, they should have been, on the open market, just buying. There was no competition. You could have made a great price. The States have to stock up. It’s like one of those things they waited, they didn’t want to spend the money because they thought this would never happen and their shelves in some cases were bare. And by the way, in some cases they weren’t. They were beautifully serviced. They did a good job, but in some cases their shelves were bare.
Donald Trump: (01:19:18)
So the best thing they can do is when times become normalized, and they will hopefully soon… And actually you’re going to have a lot of excess material because so much is being done right now in terms of protective gear, protective outfits, a lot’s being done. It’s going to be within six months. It’s going to be sold for the right price. They got to stack up for the next time. But we are doing that and the Admiral’s done a fantastic job. Senator Schumer wrote a letter today and he says, you should put a military manager. Just said, well, “Chuck, if you knew a little bit more, we have one of the most highly respected people in the military, the Admiral. This is what he does, too. Very professionally. And he’s in charge.” But Chuck didn’t know that.
Donald Trump: (01:20:02)
Okay.
Journalist 4 : (01:20:04)
Mr. President, you tweeted this morning about your call with Saudi Arabia’s MBS. We’ve had some people say that the figures that you cited between 10 million and 15 million barrels per day is not what they’re agreeing to. Can you be more specific about [crosstalk 01:20:19]
Donald Trump: (01:20:19)
I don’t know what they’re agreeing to. I think they might agree to more than that. Look, Russia [crosstalk 01:20:26] yeah, we did say that actually. Russia talked about 10 million barrels. Russia and Saudi Arabia are fighting over this and as everybody knows, it’s really killing an industry, hurting Russia badly, hurting Saudi Arabia badly. I said, “This is an easy one. It should be an easy one.” And it may be 10 and it may be more than that. I was actually told it may be 10 as I told somebody before, it may be 10 and it may be more than that. Maybe it’s 15 maybe it goes up to 15 could be as high as 15 and there’s a tremendous oversupply right now. That industry was oversupplied before the virus and where the virus came along, they lost 35, 40% of the world.
Donald Trump: (01:21:14)
And there’s an unbelievable… You can’t get a ship now. Every ship is loaded to the gills sitting out someplace in the ocean. They’re storage tanks, they’re not even ships, they’re storage tanks. So it would be great for Russia. It would be great for Saudi Arabia. I hope they make that deal. But that’s what they told me. They said it’s… [crosstalk 01:21:31] Well, I think it’ll be hopefully soon. I think hopefully they’ll announce something soon. Now can a deal be broken? Can something happen where it doesn’t happen? I guess in which case there’s another alternative, but I’d rather not see that other alternative. I hope they can make a deal. I think they both want to make a deal and they’re both smart. They love their countries, they want to make a deal. It’s good, but it’s also good for the world if they do because you save an industry. Go ahead. Go ahead in the back.
Journalist 5: (01:22:02)
What do you mean by cash payments?
Donald Trump: (01:22:06)
We went over this very specifically and I’ll let you talk about it, Mike, as you responded last time.
Mike Pence: (01:22:11)
Right. Thank you, Mr. President. As I said yesterday, the president has put a priority on ensuring that no American has to worry about the cost of coronavirus testing. And we’ve been working every day to make sure that Americans don’t have to worry about the cost of treatment. And at this point, the White House coronavirus task force is working on a proposal for the president to use some of the $100 billion that we’re making available to hospitals to compensate the hospitals directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured Americans. We’re working out the details of that. The president will make a final decision tomorrow. We expect an announcement.
Mike Pence: (01:22:54)
But the president’s made it very clear. We don’t want any American to worry about the cost of getting a test or the cost of getting treatment and we’ve expanded coverage through Medicaid. We’ve expanded coverage through Medicare. Health insurance companies around the country, including Blue Cross just today announced that all of their members will be waiving all co payments on coronavirus treatment. But for those some 30 odd million uninsured Americans, the president has directed the coronavirus task force to find a way to make sure that they know we will find a way to pay for your coronavirus treatment and the president will be addressing that and announcing that tomorrow.
Journalist 6: (01:23:39)
[crosstalk 01:23:39] Mr. President, a point of clarification and then a follow up question. Yesterday you said that you spoke to Florida governor Ron DeSantis before he issued his stay at home order. Did you advise him to issue that order?
Donald Trump: (01:23:50)
No, but I talked to him about it and he wants to do what’s right for the people of Florida. He’s been a great governor. You could see that just by his popularity, which is extraordinary. We’re proud of him. He’s done a fantastic job. And he made the decision, but we spoke before he made the decision. Yes.
Journalist 6: (01:24:07)
And he’s also said that he is considering putting people who are suspected of having coronavirus or who have tested positive for it in isolation centers so that he could [crosstalk 00:14:17].
Donald Trump: (01:24:18)
That I haven’t heard, no. That I haven’t heard.
Journalist 6: (01:24:18)
So hasn’t consulted with you?
Donald Trump: (01:24:20)
I haven’t heard that.
Journalist 7: (01:24:21)
Thank you, Mr. President. Ebony Bowden from the New York Post. A few hours ago, mayor De Blasio, the Mayer of New York, said that New Yorkers leaving their hearts to wear masks, they should also wear masks when they’re with other people. Are you considering that kind of recommendation on a federal level? And if you are, how would you prevent a rush on N95 masks?
Donald Trump: (01:24:40)
Well, I think they’re going to be coming out with regulations on that and if people want to abide by them, frankly, I don’t think they’ll be mandatory because some people don’t want to do that. But if people want… As an example on the masks, if people wanted to wear them, they can. If people wanted to use scarves, which they have, many people have them, they can. In many cases the scarf is better. It’s thicker. Depending on the material, it’s thicker. But they could do that if they want. Now a recommendation’s coming out. We’ll see what that recommendation is. [crosstalk 01:25:14] But I will say this, they can pretty much decide for themselves right now.
Journalist 8: (01:25:18)
[crosstalk 01:25:18] nationwide? And can I just also ask… [crosstalk 01:25:19] and I think this as best for Dr. Burke’s. But we’ve heard some differing guidance here. The WHO and even the surgeon general have talked about various studies that show that masks in addition to maybe not even being helpful to protecting people may actually increase the rates of illness because people touch the masks and they touch themselves. Can you talk a little bit about just the evolution of your thinking on this? [crosstalk 01:25:42].
Donald Trump: (01:25:40)
All right. Maybe I will ask Dr. Burkes. And you might mention that other point also.
Dr. Birx: (01:25:47)
Yeah. Thank you. So I hope you got from the conference today that we’re triangulating data that we know from the case numbers, the testing numbers, the supply chain numbers to create an integrated picture so that we can really support hospitals in their needs. And I think that level of granularity is really critical. Secondly, I just want to make the point that we really applaud the governors that are looking at a whole of state or a whole of metro approach. And what do I mean by that? The United States going into this had about 160,000 ventilators across the United States and another 60,000 to 70,000 anesthesia machines. That’s about five times what most of the European countries have, but it’s a matter of distribution to need and I really applaud the governors that are bringing together their public hospitals with their more private hospitals and their visibility across their state.
Dr. Birx: (01:26:52)
Because what we tried to talk about yesterday is every state, every county is different. That’s why we’re looking at it at that level of granularity. And as we move through this epidemic, the needs need to be very tailored to those counties and frankly, those hospitals. There is a reason why the president and Mr. Kushner have been very much involved in finding out what the public hospitals need. Why is that? Because the public hospitals sometimes have the weakest supply chain because they’re often sometimes not as attractive to private sector distributors or they may be too busy caring for the needs of patients to be really on top of their order forms and their supply chains. So really listening to the community that’s at the front of the of this fight and getting feedback from those specific communities no matter where they are and listening to the frontline healthcare workers because it’s their reality that is important to all of us, whether you’re the mayor or the governor or the federal government.
Dr. Birx: (01:27:55)
And if they are saying they need something, we have to work together to supply that. And so that’s what you’re seeing with this triangulation. Every county will move through this differently and that allows us to move around these vital issues that protect the frontline healthcare workers and protect the patients through the ventilators to make sure that the supply chain is aligned with the need as it happens. Now you have to have very good data in order to be willing to work in that level of granularity. And that’s what we’ve been working on to really develop that level of granularity to ensure that. So I just wanted to say one other thing about testing. Just to give you the bottom line data of what we’re seeing. We appreciate the groups who are reporting. Not everyone is reporting yet. And this is part of us trying to understand at a very granular level, we do have two States that do have 35% positives and that’s New York and New Jersey.
Dr. Birx: (01:28:54)
So that confirms very clearly that that’s a very clear and important hot spot. Louisiana though has 26% of their tests are positive. Michigan, Connecticut, Indiana, Georgia, Illinois… So that should tell you where the next hotspots are coming, are at 15% test positive. And then Colorado, DC, Rhode Island and Massachusetts are at 13%. There’s a significant number of States still under 10% everyone that I didn’t discuss. California and Washington remains steady at an 8% rate. So what we’re seeing finally is testing improving, more testing being done, still a high level of negatives in States without hotspots, allowing them to do more of this surveillance and containment. And then prioritizing this new rapid test kit to those areas that may not have the same amount of access to the Indian health services and to the public health institutions and the public health and state labs so that they can use that and start forward leaning into surveillance. Now we know there are people waiting for tests and they’re waiting for tests because when these areas got onto the logarithmic curve, we prioritized people where the test decision would make it critical for their care. And so we prioritized hospitals and we prioritize nurses and doctors and frontline workers. So that means if you went through a drive through or you went through your doctor, you could have that delay. So the masks? So what I tried to give you is how we’re using data in a very granular way. And so there is experiential data when you look at communities that have oftentimes utilized masks in general for personal protection from when they particularly are themselves sick and have used their masks in public. And we’ve looked at the rate of this Covid-19 in those populations. And then we’re looking at the scientific evidence to bring those two pieces together. Let me just say one thing though. The most important thing is the social distancing and washing your hands. And we don’t want people to get an artificial sense of protection because they’re behind a mask. Because if they’re touching things, remember your eyes are not in the mask. So if you’re touching things and then touching your eyes, you’re exposing yourself in the same way. So we don’t want people to feel like, “Oh, I’m wearing a mask, I’m protected and I’m protecting others.” You may be protecting others but don’t get a false sense of security that that mask is protecting you exclusively from getting infected because there are other ways that you can get infected because of the number of asymptomatic and mild cases that are out there.
Dr. Birx: (01:31:50)
And so this worries us and that’s why the debate is continuing about the mask because we don’t want… When we’re trying to send a signal that every single person in this country needs to stay six feet away from everybody. That needs to be washing their hands constantly and know where their hands are to send a signal that we think a mask is equivalent to those pieces. So when the advisory comes out, it will be an additive piece if it comes out rather than saying, “This is a substitute for”, and we want to make sure everybody understands it is not a substitute for the presidential guidelines that have already gone out. And to be absolutely clear about that.
Journalist 9: (01:32:31)
Quick question about [crosstalk 01:32:33] the test. There’s a lot of evidence we’re seeing, the experts are saying that a high number of these tests could be producing false negatives. So…
Dr. Birx: (01:32:45)
Of the Roche and Abbott test?
Journalist 9: (01:32:48)
That as many as one in three tests might be providing false negatives. I thought maybe you could explain [crosstalk 01:32:54].
Dr. Birx: (01:32:52)
That would almost be impossible with having 35% positives. If that was true, you would have 100% positive or 66% positive. So what I can tell you is the number of positive tests is tracking very closely with the number of cases diagnosed. So I will look into that. I look at the Roche and Abbott numbers every night. They’re trending exactly in the same way and that’s important when you’re validating data to really validate does this same site… In other words, I’m looking between testing sites to see are there consistencies, is there an anomaly to make sure for what you just very specifically asked. So I will go back and look at it more carefully. I haven’t seen that kind of anomaly.
Dr. Birx: (01:33:42)
This same platform is being used across the and that’s a range from what I reported, 3% positivity up to 35% positivity and that range reflects also what we’re seeing with the hotspots and the number of cases and frankly, we hate to talk about it, but it also tracks with the hospitalizations independent of diagnosis and the mortality that we’re seeing. So all of those pieces validate together.
Journalist 9: (01:34:10)
[crosstalk 01:34:10] you concerned that people might be getting a false sense of security or that we might not be seeing all of the data here on the composite?
Dr. Birx: (01:34:15)
Well, I’m telling you that I’m still missing 50% of the data from reporting. I have 660 tests reported in. We’ve done 1.3 million. So there is… And it could be those sites. So we do need to see… The bill said you need to report. We’re still not receiving 100% of the tests.
Journalist 10: (01:34:36)
[crosstalk 01:34:36] With regard to the test, the President’s sample collection took one minute, results were reported back in 15 minutes. I realized you’re the president of the United States, but when will everyone get to take a test that works that quickly and you get results that quickly?
Dr. Birx: (01:34:51)
So these are new tests and we have prioritized the groups that we think have the least access to testing now. And who do we mean by that? We mean the Indian health service. They’re often in remote areas, rural areas. The governors of the Northwestern States that may not have the advantage of these high throughput machines that are often across the East coast and in high metro areas, Colorado and then across the West coast. So we’ve prioritized the presidential 15 minute test to the Indian health services and public health labs so that they can support nursing home testing and other areas where we think surveillance is absolutely key. So at this moment they’re prioritized in that way. [crosstalk 01:35:38] Yes, 1,200 of them are going out in that way.
Journalist 10: (01:35:41)
[crosstalk 01:35:41] Do more of those tests need to be made in order for more people…
Donald Trump: (01:35:43)
They are being made.
Dr. Birx: (01:35:44)
Yeah.
Journalist 10: (01:35:45)
Okay. So in a matter of…
Donald Trump: (01:35:46)
They’re moving very quickly.
Dr. Birx: (01:35:47)
So I’m glad you asked that because today, there’s 18,000 of these machines already out there. We’re trying to find out exactly where everyone is because you can see that gives you amazing flexibility because if people would allow it to be loaned to a state that’s in a hot spot or a state where you want to do additional surveillance, 18,000 tests, 18,000 machines is a huge amount and it really gets to your very question about how we can prioritize what we have at the same time we’re moving out what is new. So really figuring out who should those go to, how can we ask communities, because these will be in the community, to share those machines into the community who need the testing now. And I think that’s really an incredible question that really needs to be answered over the next 24 hours.
Journalist 11: (01:36:42)
A point of clarity about the face covering guidance. You said it’s still a point of debate. You said they use the phrase “the guidance if it comes out.” Is the guidance coming out and when?
Mike Pence: (01:36:52)
Yes.
Journalist 11: (01:36:53)
And when, sir?
Mike Pence: (01:36:54)
In the days ahead, we’re currently working through the task force seeking the consultation advice of the CDC, our top health experts, and we’ll be bringing forward the guidance from the CDC in the next several days.
Dr. Birx: (01:37:09)
Just remember it’s not a substitute for everything that we’re asking people to do. And just do that to everybody out there across the country, when we say no gatherings of 10, we want it to be clear if you have a family of 10 we don’t want you to be split up. But we don’t expect people to be having dinner parties, cocktail parties. I know you’ve seen the slope in the United States versus the slope in Italy and we have to change that slope. We have to change the logarithmic curve that we’re on.
Dr. Birx: (01:37:46)
We see country after country having done that. What it means in the United States is not everyone is doing it. So we’re only as strong is every community, every county, every state, every American following the guidelines to a T. And I can tell by the curve and as it is today that not every American is following it, and so this is really a call to action. We see Spain, we see Italy, we see France, we see Germany. When we see others beginning to bend their curves, we can bend ours, but it means everybody has to take that same responsibility as Americans.
Journalist 11: (01:38:31)
[crosstalk 01:38:31] Mr. President, can I have a quick follow up on oil, please. In your conversations with Russia and Saudi Arabia, did you have to make any concessions to get them to agree to cut their production? Like did you agree to taught us production of oil?
Donald Trump: (01:38:45)
We didn’t discuss that. They want to do that. That’s good for their countries and we did not discuss that now.
Journalist 11: (01:38:52)
[crosstalk 01:38:52] NBC News has learned that the Navy is set to fire the Captain of the USS Theodore Roosevelt after he raised red flags about the Covid-19 outbreak on his ship. It appears as if he’s being punished for trying to save the lives of the sailors in his command. What’s your assessment?
Donald Trump: (01:39:09)
[crosstalk 01:39:09] we’re going to wait a little while because I understand there’s a news conference by the secretary of defense about that. But you know, I don’t agree with that at all. Not at all. Not even a little bit. Yeah.
Journalist 12: (01:39:20)
Thank you. This morning you said once again that New York got off to a late start and they should have pushed harder but governors and other state leaders say they rely on the federal government to assess the situation and how risky it is and they want to know how would they have known to start sooner without your guidance?
Donald Trump: (01:39:42)
Well, they have experts and frankly long after we came out and talked about it… Look, how would I have known to cut off China? I cut off China very early and if I didn’t, we would have a chart that you wouldn’t believe. So how would I know to do that? How would I know to cut off Europe? I cut off Europe very early. You have to make a decision. People knew that some bad things were going on and they got off to a late start and some others got off to a late start also, but we cut off China. If we didn’t cut off China, we would have been in some big trouble and we cut it off and you know what? We cut it off way early. Go ahead
Journalist 13: (01:40:31)
Mr. President, a follow up on the insurance point in a separate question that came in from a colleague who can’t be in the room.
Donald Trump: (01:40:38)
Okay, go ahead.
Journalist 13: (01:40:38)
On the insurance point is they’re going to, [crosstalk 01:40:42].
Donald Trump: (01:40:41)
Who are you with?
Journalist 13: (01:40:42)
Roll Call. Is there going to be an opportunity for insurance companies, if in fact hospitals are compensated for uncompensated care, are the insurance companies going to also get compensated for its extraordinary expenses that they may have or they you’re assuming that cost?
Donald Trump: (01:41:02)
So we haven’t discussed it but we’re talking to them. Getting them not to pay copays in the case of the big ones was a tremendous thing. That’s a lot of money they gave up, but we’re discussing that with the insurance companies. We’ll let you know. It’ll be pretty quickly. Yeah, go ahead.
Journalist 14: (01:41:16)
I have a question on Japan, sir. They are expanding their entry ban to include the United States. Are you planning to take any similar action to ban Japanese nationals from coming to the U.S. as a result of this crisis?
Donald Trump: (01:41:31)
Well, we’re looking at a lot of things and a lot of different bans. We have more bans than anybody. We had bans when bans weren’t fashionable, if you remember right at the beginning of this administration was for different reasons. But we’ve had bans long before people thought of bans. When I did China, it had never been done before. I was the first one to do to remember that it had never, according to what I read it all the papers, this had never been done. This is a terrible thing to do. And four weeks later they were all saying, we’re lucky we did it. So we’re looking at it. No, we heard that. And I think it’s fine that they do that. They’re trying to protect their country and we have to protect our country. Yeah, please.
Journalist 10: (01:42:15)
[crosstalk 01:42:15] Mr. President, I asked you yesterday about stay at home orders and if that decision should be left in the hands of governors or if you’re considering telling the entire nation, “Stay at home.” So just today, Georgia’s governor finally issued a stay at home order saying that “Individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad, but we didn’t know that until the last 24 hours.” Is that ignorance, gross incompetence? [crosstalk 01:42:40]
Donald Trump: (01:42:40)
He’s a good governor, Brian Kemp. He’s a very good… [crosstalk 01:42:42] he’s a good.
Journalist 10: (01:42:43)
Have you been having calls with these governors?
Donald Trump: (01:42:43)
He’s a good governor and he has to make his own decision on that. I let the States… I think we’re about 85% a positive on that. If you look, I think it’s about 85% of the States have got the stay at home. Brian’s a great governor. It’s his decision. He made that decision. Ultimately he decided to go along with it and they’re doing well and the state is doing well in many respects. Yeah, go ahead please.
Journalist 5: (01:43:07)
This is another question from a colleague who couldn’t make it in today from Emily Goodin at The Daily Mail. I had a question in regards to the Russian plane that landed at JFK with medical supplies. Did the United States ask Russia for this aid or is it just accepting it?
Donald Trump: (01:43:21)
We’re accepting it. It was a very nice offer from President Putin. I spoke to him the other night as I told you, and they had excess medical equipment, things and I’ll take it, I’ll take it. I think it’s very nice. [crosstalk 01:43:36] We’ve had some from China. We also help other countries. We like doing that. Like I said before, if we have excess stuff, we let it go out. We let some go out where frankly they had orders for it and I didn’t want to stop orders. It was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin and I could have said “No thank you” or I could have said “Thank you” and it was a large plane of very high quality medical supplies and I said, ” I’ll take it.”
Journalist 5: (01:44:01)
Is he offering any further aid, in your conversation?
Donald Trump: (01:44:04)
I think he would if we asked for it, but he was very nice. It was part of the call he suggested. He said, we have it, it’s additional. They have very big difficulties with this virus also, as you know, Russia. I thought it was a very nice gesture on behalf of President Putin. I could’ve said, “No, I don’t want it.” Or I could have said, “I’ll take it”, and you know what? I said, “I’ll take it.”
Journalist 5: (01:44:24)
[crosstalk 01:44:24] accept further aid?
Donald Trump: (01:44:25)
I think so. Yeah. If they sent things that we need, I’d take it. Sure. Nice gesture.
Journalist 15: (01:44:30)
[crosstalk 01:44:30] Are you concerned about Russian propaganda?
Donald Trump: (01:44:31)
I’m not concerned about Russian propaganda. Not even a little bit. He offered a lot of medical, high quality stuff that I accepted, and that may save a lot of lives. I’ll take it everyday. Please. In the back.
Journalist 16: (01:44:45)
[crosstalk 01:44:45] Mr. President you said that in January that you stand with the people of Iran since the beginning of your presidency and you’ll continue to stand with the people of Iran. Given the fact they’re so hard hit with coronavirus [crosstalk 01:44:57].
Donald Trump: (01:44:56)
Well, they’re very hard hit. They’re very hard hit. [crosstalk 01:44:57]
Journalist 16: (01:44:56)
But would you consider… [crosstalk 01:45:01].
Donald Trump: (01:44:56)
In a lot of ways they’re hard hit. They’re hard hit with their economy, with their military.
Donald Trump: (01:45:03)
Hard hit. They are hit with their economy, with their military, and obviously the virus. They’re very hard hit.
Reporter 1: (01:45:07)
Would you consider easing sanctions to allow medical supplies to get in?
Donald Trump: (01:45:11)
Well, they haven’t even asked us to do that.
Reporter 1: (01:45:12)
But we know that sanctions hit the people, not the government.
Donald Trump: (01:45:16)
You know what? They haven’t even asked us to do that. If they want to meet, would love to meet and we’d love to settle the whole thing out, but I doubt they’ll be.
Reporter 1: (01:45:24)
So, realistically, how does a person in Tehran pick up the phone and call you?
Donald Trump: (01:45:27)
I think they love America. I think the Iranians love America. I think they’d love to be free. I think they’d love to have just some of the things that we have. I remember Iran many years ago, friends of mine were always in Iran. They were doing real estate deals in Iran. They were building beautiful buildings all over Iran. Apartment houses. They were very successful and then one day that came to an end, but you know what? The people of Iran, they remember that. It was a long time ago, but not so long ago, and they remember it. And I’ll tell you, they love America. They love what we stand for and we’re not looking for change. We’re not looking for government takeover. Government change. This country has been through that many times. That doesn’t work.
Reporter 1: (01:46:10)
But you hope people do encourage other countries, who are maybe concerned about-
Donald Trump: (01:46:14)
No, but what I did is I put it out very publicly with respect to Iran. I said, if they need help with respect to the virus, we have the greatest medical professionals in the world. We’d love to send them over.
Reporter 1: (01:46:26)
What countries are you encouraging perhaps to lend their support because there are many countries that feel-
Donald Trump: (01:46:30)
I’m not encouraging or discouraging. They’ve been a very hostile country. They made a deal that President Obama should have never made. It was a short-term deal, giving them $150 billion, giving them $1.8 billion in cash. Green. Fill up this room five times.
Reporter 1: (01:46:47)
But, your administration, do you have a moral responsibility?
Donald Trump: (01:46:49)
Nobody’s even asked. I have a moral responsibility to help them if they ask. If they needed help, I would certainly consider different plans.
Reporter 1: (01:46:58)
The United Nations says they need help.
Donald Trump: (01:47:00)
Well, that’s up to the United Nations. I’m talking about us and what happens is, if they wanted help, because they have a very big case of virus. A very, very big case. One of the worst on earth, if you believe what you’re reading. And I happen to believe what I see and what I know and if they wanted help, we’d give them help. Yeah, you had one in the back.
Reporter 2: (01:47:23)
Thanks, Mr. President. And a question for Jared too. You talk about a granular approach to receiving data from these different states and regions to try and figure out what they need. The president, you just enacted the BPA on ventilators and masks. Are there any signals from across the country that might indicate there are other things besides masks and ventilators that are slowly rising in terms of need, like hand sanitizer for instance?
Jared Kushner: (01:47:54)
Sure. So, the first issue that we’ve been dealing with was really the ventilators. That the number one, number two, and number three from all the states. What we’ve been finding is that people have a lot of these requests based on the models. And what we’ve been trying to do over at FEMA is say to the States, “Well, if you would like ventilators, first look in your states.” For example, in Northern Jersey, they’re going down to Southern Jersey and they’re finding ventilators and trying to relocate them to where they have their hotspots. The second thing that we’ve done is we’ve asked them to survey for alternative ventilators. Dr. Birx spoke before about the anesthesia machines and the ability to convert them to be ventilators. So, we’re asking people to be resourceful inside their states before they come to the federal government. The third thing we’ve been asking states to do is to provide what their daily utilization rates are. So, everyone’s asking for everything.
Jared Kushner: (01:48:41)
One Congressman got a call from his local hospitals saying, “I need 250 ventilators.” And he said, “Well, you don’t have a COVID patient within four counties. Why do you want 250 ventilators?” And he says, “Well, we just want to be safe. We’re very nervous right now.” So, what you have all over the country is a lot of people are asking for things that they don’t necessarily need at the moment. And the job of FEMA and Admiral Polowczyk has been to try to make sure that we’re getting the real data from the cities, from the states, that we can make real-time allocation decisions based on the data. Right now, what’s happening is a lot of the different cities and states are providing FEMA that information, we’re talking to them daily, they’re updating that information daily, and that’s enabling the federal government to make much more informed decisions on where they position ventilators.
Jared Kushner: (01:49:26)
You also have a situation where in some states, FEMA allocated ventilators to the states and you have instances where in cities they’re running out, but the state still has a stockpile and the notion of the federal stockpile was, it’s supposed to be our stockpile. It’s not supposed to be state stockpiles that they then use. So, we’re encouraging the states to make sure that they’re assessing the needs, they’re getting the data from their local situations, and then trying to fill it with the supplies that we’ve given them. The same thing with the masks. So, the N95 mask is actually an item that wasn’t used as frequently in the medical profession before this. It was used mostly for diseases. So, speaking to a lot of the doctors and hospital administrators, they would say they used actually a very low percentage of the N95 masks.
Jared Kushner: (01:50:08)
What the president and the vice president were able to do with Congress was to get the waiver so that you could expand the pool because a lot of N masks were used for the construction industry. So, now there’s a much bigger pool of masks in the country. There was a stockpile. They distributed that based on where they anticipated a lot of the need would go, but a lot of that still is stuck with the states and it hasn’t trickled down to the right places within the state. So, I would just encourage you, when you have governors saying that the federal government hasn’t given them what they need, I would just urge you to ask them, “Well, have you looked within your state to make sure that you haven’t been able to find the resources?” Unlike other countries, a lot of the medical system in America is private. It’s not public, government-controlled.
Jared Kushner: (01:50:47)
So, you have to get the data from what’s in their state. Look at it in that way, and then make sure that they’re being resourceful in a way to do that. Also ask them what their utilization percentage is, because if one governor’s asking for more ventilators and if the federal government sends them more than they need, the goal here is not to have ventilators sitting in a warehouse where you have another state where you have people who need them. So, what we’re trying to do is make informed data-driven decisions both on ventilators, masks, any other supply we can get to make sure it’s going to the people who need them.
Reporter 3: (01:51:19)
I wonder if you could weigh in on the reports, which I’m sure you’re aware, where unnamed White House officials have described your role as being something of running a shadow task force. How do you describe your role? How do you describe the qualifications you bring to your role?
Jared Kushner: (01:51:32)
Yeah. I would just say very simply, look, the president asked the vice president to run the task force. The vice president asked me to assist. I’ve been serving really at the direction of the vice president. He’s asked me to get involved in different projects. The vice president and I speak probably sometimes five, 10 times a day, but everything that I’m doing is that the direction of the vice president. If some people are talking to you, that means they’re probably not informed as to what’s going on. But I can assure you that I’m speaking with Dr. Birx, Dr. Fauci, the vice president, and the president multiple times a day to make sure that I’m accomplishing and focusing on the objectives that the vice president deems a priority.
Reporter 2: (01:52:12)
Jared, a follow-up on the ventilators-
Donald Trump: (01:52:12)
Or they don’t exist. Those sources don’t exist. They’re fake sources. A lot of fake sources out there. They don’t exist. For a lot of time I’ve been reading, a lot of the fake sources they don’t exist. The national stockpile,
Reporter 4: (01:52:19)
Thank you, Mr. President. Jared, what triggers sending a ventilator from the national stockpile to a state? In other words, how sick does somebody have to be to get one of these national ventilators?
Jared Kushner: (01:52:33)
Well, that’s not the criteria. You have the states basically putting in the request and they’re giving us their utilization percentages. So, it’s a very simple formula. The states should know how many ventilators they have in their states. And by the way, some governors you speak to are senators and they don’t know what’s in their state. Some governors I’ll speak to and they’ll know to the number how many ventilators they have in their state because that’s the first thing a good manager will do. What a lot of the voters are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or governor or president, you’re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis. This is a time of crisis and you’re seeing certain people are better managers than others.
Jared Kushner: (01:53:11)
So, what I would say is that the way that the federal government’s trying to allocate it as they’re trying to make sure a, you have your data. Don’t ask us for things when you know that when you don’t know what you have in your own state. Just because you’re scared, you ask your medical professionals and they don’t know, you have to take inventory of what you have in your own state and then you have to be able to show that there’s a real need. So, we pre-positioned a lot of things because most governors off the bat didn’t know what they needed, but FEMA has a joint command with Admiral Polowczyk, Admiral Giroir and Pete Gaynor, where every couple of hours when their requests come in, they evaluate the request, they all vote on the requests, and then if there’s something that they want to elevate to the task force, they bring it to the vice president to make a recommendation. [crosstalk 01:53:53]
Mike Pence: (01:53:54)
We’re literally tracking hospitalization cases on a daily basis, interacting with governors and health systems, and that informs our supply chain decisions.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:54:07)
Yeah, I want to thank the health commissioners and all of them that have been sending hospital data in. I think it’s really critical and important to all of us. New York City has been providing information, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and certainly Louisiana in these hotspots. That allows us, we can see where they are with the rising number of cases, where they are in their curve, what can be predicted, and really ensuring that people get what they need as they need it. So, I think many of the governors now and the health commissioners have been, “I’m intubating 20 people a day. Now I have enough for the next three days. If that doubles, we’re seeing our hospitalization rates stabilizing, but we still think there will be this many more in the next days.” That’s the information that they then translate into providing the ventilators. So, when you see the ventilator numbers going out, they’re going out in 150s and 200s because I think early on, we sent a big bolus out and then not all of them even today have been fully utilized. So, we want to make sure every state and every hotspot can be reassured that ventilators are there for them as they move through the curve. I think to date we’ve been able to do that. That’s what’s important to me is that people have what they need when they need it and to date people who have needed ventilators have been able to get on ventilators. I think that’s our goal with governors and with the mayors to make sure that continues to happen. But that means all of us have to work together. I think that’s what’s been really important over the last few weeks is people are not making generic requests anymore. They’re making data-driven requests because they know precisely what’s happening in their hospitals.
Reporter 5: (01:56:01)
Dr. Burke, when you were up here a little bit ago, you talked about the curve and what you’re seeing and your concern that people are not abiding by the social distancing guidelines. You seemed in your voice to be quite concerned about that. Has the curve changed enough at this point where that 100,000 to 240,000 people likely to die, has that shifted upwards at all?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:56:26)
No, it’s just when I look at … so, we’re in week 2.2 in our guidelines and I guess what I expected when the president put out guidelines that said don’t go to bars. Don’t be in groups more than 10 people. When we said that now over 16 days ago, that was serious. Then, you could see what happened subsequently and you can see the number of individuals who have been infected since then, because the people we’re seeing infected today and in hospitals today, were infected after the guidelines went out. So, that’s what we’re worried about and we’re worried that we’re still in this and that’s why the president extended it for 30 days. But we have to get out of this. We have to start seeing this.
Donald Trump: (01:57:21)
But Deborah, aren’t you referring to just a few states because many of those States are dead flat? [crosstalk 01:57:28]
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:57:28)
Yes. There are states that are dead flat, but what changes the curve is a new Detroit, a new Chicago, a new New Orleans, a new Colorado. Those change the curves because it all of a sudden spikes with the number of new cases because you have a certain projection of new cases and then a whole nother city comes on top where they’re in their logarithmic phase. So, those ones that I talked about that had test results greater than 13% positive, all of those states or all of those counties are in logarithmic phase.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:58:09)
That means there are a lot of counties that aren’t and we’re excited about those counties that have been testing and still finding quite flat and hopefully, maybe Sunday or so or sometime this weekend we can go through all the states and the curves again. So you can see where, that California and Washington are still steady, but we’re watching very carefully because we see that you can go from this to this very quickly and this should not be happening any longer in new places if people are doing this social distancing, washing their hands, not getting together in large groups more than 10.
Donald Trump: (01:58:54)
But, again, I look at the graphs all the time and you have many, many flatliners. I call them flatliners. I’m amazed at that. And you have a couple that are up. It’s hard to blame the flatliners for not doing a good job.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:59:09)
No, no, I don’t want to say that. No, don’t … No thank you, sir. In fact, I want to praise the States and I want to be able to call them out and show you their graphs so you can see. They’ve had steady small cases. They’re testing and they’re doing a lot of testing and their percent of test positives are under 5%. I mean, we have a whole group of States who are testing, and their positivity rate is under 5%. We know what it looks like on the logarithmic curve. You’re in the 13%, then 15%, then 26%, and then 35%. That’s what we’re trying to prevent and it’s the metro areas that are absolutely crucial in this. So, if you’re in a Metro area or you’re in a small city, please make sure all of your friends and family are following the guidelines. That’s the best thing we can do.
Donald Trump: (02:00:03)
Yeah, because I saw those pens going five minutes ago. They were thrilled. The fact is, yes, we compare them to Italy, one place, and we have many places that are really doing, and I think that’s what Deborah meant. She didn’t mean all of them, so when you write your story tomorrow, maybe you’ll write it correctly. She was talking about one state and another state is having a hard time and they’re closely associated. By the way, the people are doing a very good job, including the people that live there. But, when Deborah was talking about Italy, she was talking about the one and then the other was lower and then you have mostly states that have been unbelievable. So, she wasn’t talking about the average of everything.
Donald Trump: (02:00:47)
She was talking about an individual state, which is, I think, still better than Italy. Italy is having a hard time. By the way, Spain is having a hard time. France is having a hard time, but our states, generally speaking, it’s like lots of different countries all over. Many of those countries are doing a phenomenal job. They’re really flat and I think that’s what you meant.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (02:01:10)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (02:01:12)
I don’t know. I don’t want to speak for her. [crosstalk 02:01:13] But that’s what I understood she meant. Yeah, please.
Reporter 3: (02:01:17)
I have a question about that though because Coronavirus is present in all 50 States. Before, when you implored mayors and governors to be serious about this, you said once it shows up, mitigation efforts are too late. So, how do you then square that with this notion that some states are doing well? I mean, the virus doesn’t abide by United States laws.
Donald Trump: (02:01:35)
Because some states they stay in better, they’re not touching, whatever it is. They’re not going out. They’re not in groups and some states are not probably as good for whatever reason, or they also live a lot closer. New York is very dense, and California is pretty dense too and they’ve got a very good record going so far. We hope it doesn’t spike up, but it’s very flat. We have states that are doing incredibly well. When I looked at some of them, I looked at some states that I would’ve thought maybe wouldn’t have done as well, and they’re really flatlined. Hope they stay that way. I hope they stay that way. [crosstalk 02:02:11]
Reporter 6: (02:02:12)
Sir, isn’t that the point, that you want those states to stay flatlined?
Donald Trump: (02:02:15)
I want them. That’s what I’m saying. No. But when Debra mentioned about Italy and our country, she wasn’t referring to our country. She was referring to one state.
Reporter 3: (02:02:25)
She’s encouraging people to do a better job of following these social distancing measures. That’s what I’m understanding.
Donald Trump: (02:02:32)
Okay, so my understanding … I’m going to let her say it, but I think that everybody would have to be thrilled with the way most States are doing. Thrilled.
Reporter 7: (02:02:41)
I don’t think she said … is that what you meant?
Donald Trump: (02:02:43)
The flatline states, states that have almost no bump. I mean, I would think … now, then you others where for whatever reason, they’re higher. That’s different, but you can’t condemn people living in a flatliner with people living in something where there’s the big bump or the bigger bump or more akin to Italy where they have some very unique problems. In all fairness to Italy, they have some very unique problems. But if you’d like to come up and-
Reporter 7: (02:03:09)
So, how many flatline do we have and how many-
Donald Trump: (02:03:12)
A lot of them.
Reporter 7: (02:03:13)
How many do we have?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (02:03:13)
So, why don’t I bring you the whole deck again and we’ll divide out the states so you can see them? Because you really have to see each state separately. That’s why I started with, there are states where you’ve heard me talk about how concerned I was. These are states that, before the guidelines went out or right after the guidelines went out, I mean you can look at … it’s on the website. If you go to the health data.org about when governors made clarity about closing their states as far as the social distancing, the washing of the hands, the bars, doing takeout, and you can line that up with the presidential guidelines. And not all states, when the presidential guidelines came out, immediately followed the presidential guidelines. Not all states did. There are states that also may have gotten many more seeds from outside communities.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (02:04:12)
That certainly is one of the issues that New York and New Jersey, Connecticut, and Rhode Island are facing. The virus came in from multiple places into those states. It was undetected early on and they have a very logarithmic curve. What I’m saying is even one of those curves in one county, in one city, is one curve too many. So, I am passionate about everyone following the guidelines because of the outlier curves. Maybe that was a better way of putting it.
Donald Trump: (02:04:46)
That’s exactly … I think that’s perfect.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (02:04:46)
The outlier curves in specific counties is to make sure that doesn’t happen anywhere else.
Reporter 7: (02:04:53)
So, would you feel better if every state did a stay at home order? Would you feel better?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (02:04:59)
I think most of the states have done that. I think if you … one death from this is one death too many. I mean, I come out of epidemics and pandemics. We know what to do. I know we don’t have a vaccine and I know we don’t have a therapeutic, but we know what can be done and others are doing it and most of the people in the United States are doing it.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (02:05:23)
It’s our communities. It’s every American that has to make these changes and I know they’re really hard and I know it’s hard to remember. I mean, I have to say to myself every day because I’m around very important people to never touch anything. And I’m just like paranoid now about touching things. I’m sure you all are too. I mean, we’ve gotten to the place where we don’t go to your places on Pebble Beach, we go to the one that’s open-aired because I mean you’re trying to protect your reporters. I mean, I understand that. We’re all trying to protect each other, and we all have to adapt to this new reality that we’re in right now.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (02:06:02)
I believe everybody is trying really hard and I’m just asking them to try really, really hard for these next 28 days because they will make a tremendous difference. We see that evidence. So, it’s like having a vaccine or a therapeutic because we know what works and we’re asking everybody to apply what works. I know it takes amazing attention to detail because the minute you forget or do something, you’re like, “Oh my gosh. I should’ve never done that.” And that’s the level of attention it takes.
Reporter 7: (02:06:33)
If covering our faces could help us do that-
Donald Trump: (02:06:35)
So, I just want to say, many states have started low and slow and then they stayed at a good level. Some really stayed at a great level. Louisiana’s an example. It was low and slow, and they were looking great. I was watching it because it’s a place people go to with Mardi Gras, which is an interesting point because after Mardi Gras it was low and then all of a sudden it went up very rapidly and now it’s one of our true hotspots. Certain areas of Michigan. Detroit looked like it was doing pretty good and then all of a sudden it went up. So, you have that too. But I’ll tell you what, we have states that have been really incredible in the fact that they have kept so low. You haven’t seen the bump and I hope you don’t. I hope you don’t.
Donald Trump: (02:07:27)
And you have a couple that, for a lot of different reasons, and that’s not to blame anybody, but they are at a higher level. But very few. I think, Deborah, I mean, I may say, I think most people have actually followed the presidential you can call them whatever you want. I would never use the word dictates because if I used that word I would be in such trouble. In fact, you’ll put me in trouble just that I even mentioned the thought of it. But we make a recommendation and I think they’ve done a good job. Maybe they started a little later, but maybe they’re also more difficult states. But we’ve done I think on average really phenomenally as a country. I think we’ve done phenomenally because when you looked at that graph the other day, I don’t know if you saw it, I assume you saw it.
Donald Trump: (02:08:11)
Everybody in the world saw it, but you look at all those lines on the bottom, one color after another, all different representing different states. It’s all crowded at the bottom. And then you had two that were up. I don’t know, almost every one of them was down low, very low. So, there were a lot of people listening and I just want it clear because I don’t need headlines tomorrow. Neither does the country because I don’t want this country working so hard and then have press, in this case, may be misinterpret something because when I heard it, I was surprised at first too. But I understood what Deborah meant. Because I think it’s very important for you to be accurate. One other thing, just a quick thing. So, what I found is when governors called me, I think in every case they’ve always been so nice, so nice and I’ve seen them and heard them say “Thank you, very much.”
Donald Trump: (02:09:08)
“You have done a great job, a fantastic job in one case. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.” Then I’ll see the governor, usually of the opposite party in almost all cases except maybe one, but in almost all cases they’re very generous. They’re very nice. They thank me, everything’s great. We’re doing a great job. And then I’ll see him on television and it’s like a different person. And I realize there are some people, because of politics, that if they say, “We want a thousand ventilators” and I’ll say, “No, Jim. I want to give you 5,000 ventilators.”
Donald Trump: (02:09:42)
They’ll say, “Thank you. You are the greatest president that’s ever lived.” And then I’ll see them quoted in a paper or see them on a show and they’ll say, “The president didn’t come through for me. I’m very disappointed in the president.” And we have a lot of that. They’re very happy when they talk to me, Then I see them. But there are some people, if they asked for 500 of something and if I gave him 5,000, you’ll say, “How’s the president doing?” “Well, we don’t like the job.” To my face they’re very nice. But, then sometimes, I guess they assume I don’t watch them or something, but I watch very closely. Yeah, please.
Reporter 8: (02:10:17)
Mr. President. One especially vulnerable population is the prison population and, especially with Jared here, I wondered if you could address what the federal government is doing to protect inmates?
Donald Trump: (02:10:27)
Well, there’s vulnerable and then there’s close together. I can’t tell you about age, but a lot of young people in prison. Some people, some states, I have not done that at all, but some states are letting people out of prison. Some people are getting out that are very serious criminals in some states, and I don’t like that. I don’t like it. But it’s a city or state thing, in certain cases, as you know. I think, maybe Philadelphia comes to mind. So, we’ll have to see what’s going on. We don’t like it. The people don’t like it. And we’re looking in to see if I have the right to stop it in some cases. Okay?
Reporter 9: (02:11:08)
Mr. President, 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week. We haven’t heard of you talk a lot today about what they’re going through.
Donald Trump: (02:11:16)
Oh, I think it’s terrible.
Reporter 9: (02:11:16)
So, what’s your message to them?
Donald Trump: (02:11:19)
I think it’s terrible. So, look, four weeks ago we had the greatest economy in the history of the world. The greatest in the world. Greatest in the history of the world. We had the most jobs ever in the history of the United States. Almost 160 million jobs. Right? And then one day, I get a call from Deborah who’s fantastic and from Dr. Fauci and he said, and she said, “We have a problem.” I said, “What’s the problem?” And they said, “We may have to close it up.” I said, “Close what up?” They said, “Close up the country.” I said, “What’s that all about?” And we discussed today and probably not since 1917, came to that conclusion, and she is a fantastic person, a brilliant person, and this is what she knows. I said, “Has it ever been this bad?” And I think I can represent that you said no. And part of it is it’s a contagion.
Donald Trump: (02:12:20)
It’s so contagious. It’s like if you sneeze, I probably get it. Whoever heard of a thing like that? And this very talented reporter is bailing out. He’s out of here. I don’t blame you, but it’s a very contagious thing, probably the likes of which we’ve never seen in terms of that. But 1917, so that’s over a hundred years ago. But it’s been written about many, many times. That was a horrible … whether it was 75 or 100 million people, I’ve heard from 50 to 75 I’ve heard 75 to 100, but it was tens of millions of people. Now, we have the advantage of communication. This could have been just as bad. I mean, here we can read on the internet, we can see what to do, we can have these meetings, they can watch on television, which they do. A lot of people are watching. A lot of people are watching, and they say, “Gee, social distancing.”
Donald Trump: (02:13:15)
But in 1917 they didn’t have that option. They didn’t know what to do. They just noticed people were dying all over the place. Think of it. 75 to 100 million people died. A lot of people in this country died. To me, it’s a great question, how come more people didn’t die in this country? And they say it actually started in this country and went to Europe. I mean, we lost a lot of people, but relatively we lost very few compared to Europe. So, this is a terrible thing that happened and what’s happening now with people in jobs. So, think of the position I’m in. We have built all together, everybody, not me, everybody, the greatest economy in history, and all of a sudden people come in that we respect, that we know, and here’s the thing, they were right. Everybody questioned it for a while.
Donald Trump: (02:14:08)
Not everybody, but a good portion questioned it. They said, “Let’s keep it open. Let’s ride it.” If we did that, you saw the other graph, and whether it’s true or almost true or maybe not true enough, the number was 2.2 million people would’ve died. 2.2 million people would’ve died in a short period of time. In fact, the graph could have been even shorter. I always noticed that horrible one where it goes high, it actually comes down a little bit faster. It might’ve been over faster, and you would have lost 2.2 million people. So, they come in and they say, “We have to close up the country.” And I say, “You know what that does to the fabric of this country?” To people that had great jobs, great family, no problems with money? Their 401k, everything is perfect. Then all of a sudden, they go from that to having no job in one day they never even thought of it and then you see 6 million people unemployed.
Donald Trump: (02:15:05)
Unemployment numbers get released and you see 6 million people and it’s an artificial closing. It’s not like we have a massive recession or worse. It’s artificial because we turned it off. Think of what we’re doing. We’re saying, “Don’t go to work and we’ll pay you.” Everything’s the opposite. It was always “Go to work and make a lot of money and do well and the American dream.” Because of a hidden enemy we’re saying, “Don’t go to work and we’re going to pay you.” Look at the money, $2 trillion and we will probably do more. I think infrastructure would be a fantastic thing to do. You want to get the restaurants back. You give deductibility. You understand what that is. You give deductibility for businesses where they go, and they use the restaurants. The restaurants will be bigger and better than they were before.
Donald Trump: (02:15:54)
People don’t know, a lot of restaurants closed when they ended deductibility and then they started doing well, but they had fewer restaurants. But the boom of the restaurants is when they had deductibility, where corporations could use them. And entertainment, that was a great thing, but they closed it and then they closed it again and it wasn’t the same. But you want to get them back. You do that. But infrastructure, we borrow our money now at zero. If we were paying 5%, 4%, 3% it’s a different ball game. We can borrow long-term for zero. Literally zero. You know that because we’re considered the safe investment all over the world. They want money in the United States. That’s where they want the money. So, I know better than anybody. I know what they’re going through and it’s horrible, but you know what I want to do?
Donald Trump: (02:16:45)
I want to be able to get them back fast. When this is over, it’s going to be a day we’re going to celebrate because everyone’s going to go to work and I think we’re going to have boom times. I think it’s going to be great, and we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned about borders; we’ve learned about reliance on other countries. We’ve learned so much that I think we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger, and I think it’s going to come back very quickly, but first we have to defeat this enemy, so we will see you tomorrow. Thank you very much."
"Apr 1, 2020",11:50 A.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:05)
Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. So America continues to wage all out war to defeat the virus, this horrible, horrible virus. You see how terrible it is, especially when you look at the numbers from yesterday. And we explained why we’re extending our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread for 30 days. Together we have the power to save countless lives. We’re attacking the virus in every front with social distancing, economic support for our workers, rapid medical intervention, and very serious innovation and banning dangerous foreign travel that threatens the health of our people. And we did that early, far earlier than anyone would have thought and way ahead of anybody else. In this time of need, I know that every American will do their patriotic duty and help us to achieve a total victory. As governments and nations focus on the coronavirus, there’s a growing threat that cartels, criminals, terrorists, and other maligned actors will try to exploit the situation for their own gain. And we must not let that happen. We will never let that happen.
Donald Trump: (01:32)
Today, the United States is launching enhanced counter narcotics operations in the Western hemisphere to protect the American people from the deadly scourge of illegal narcotics. We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives. In cooperation with the 22 partner nations, U.S. Southern Command will increase surveillance, disruption and seizures of drug shipments and provide additional support for eradication efforts which are going on right now at a record pace. We’re deploying additional Navy destroyers, combat ships, aircraft and helicopters, Coast Guard cutters and Air Force surveillance aircraft, doubling our capabilities in the region. Very importantly, our forces are fully equipped with personnel protective equipment and we’ve taken additional safety measures to ensure our troops remain healthy. Secretary Mark Esper, Attorney General Bill Barr, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien will provide more details. In addition, I’m going to have General Milley, who’s done an incredible job so many ways, say a few words and also with us our Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Gilday, who you know, I think you know and Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Schultz.
Donald Trump: (03:04)
So I’m going to ask Mark to start and then we can go and after that we’re going to take questions as it pertains to this and then we’ll go on to phase two, which is the virus itself. Okay, thank you, please, Mark.
Mark Esper: (03:21)
Well, thank you Mr. President and good afternoon everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today as we make this a very important announcement. At a time when the nation and the Department of Defense are focused on protecting the American people from the spread of the coronavirus, we also remain vigilant to the many other threats our country faces. Today, at the President’s direction, the Department of Defense in close cooperation with our inter-agency partners began enhanced counter-narcotics operations in Eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. This initiative is part of the administration’s whole of government approach to combating the flow of illicit drugs into the United States and protecting the American people from their scourge.
Mark Esper: (04:03)
I want to thank all of our partners in this effort to include the United States Coast Guard, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Department of Justice, and members of the intelligence community for the tremendous support and cooperation. To conduct these enhanced operations, the President has directed the deployment of additional ships, aircraft, and security forces to the United States Southern Command area of responsibility. Included in this force package are Navy destroyers and littoral combat ships, Coast Guard Cutters, P.A. patrol aircraft, and elements of an Army security force assistance brigade. These additional forces will nearly double our capacity to conduct counter-narcotics operations in the region. Additionally, 22 partner nations have joined us in this fight, bring with them a variety of intelligence and operations capabilities needed to defeat these criminal organizations. Last year alone, United States Southern Command’s operations resulted in the seizure of over 280 metric tons of drugs, much of which was designated for shipment to America.
Mark Esper: (05:03)
While this was an incredible achievement, there’s much more work to be done. Transnational criminal organizations continue to threaten our security by smuggling cocaine, fentanyl, methamphetamines and other narcotics across our borders. These drug traffickers put our communities at risk and destroy lives. Every year, tens of thousands of Americans die from drug overdose and thousands more suffer the harmful effects of addiction. Furthermore, corrupt actors like the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela, rely on the profits derived from the sell of narcotics to maintain their oppressive hold on power. The Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro’s criminal control over the country. Drug traffickers are seizing on this lawlessness by increasing their illicit activities. We must do more to prevent these drugs from arriving at our shores. These enhanced counter-narcotics operations that are now underway will further disrupt the flow of illicit drugs to America, deny our adversaries the financial resources they depend on and build the capacity of our partner nations throughout the region.
Mark Esper: (06:08)
I want to thank President Trump for his leadership and support to this critical mission. This is particularly important time for this operation to begin. As nations around the world shift their focus inward to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, many criminal organizations are attempting to capitalize on this crisis. The enhanced operations we are announcing today will keep the pressure on these criminal groups and protect the American people from the devastation caused by the flow of illegal drugs into our country. Mr. President, thank you for your leadership as we begin this important operation. While the men and women of the United States military work hard here at home to fight the coronavirus, we continue to take action around the world to defend our great country. Thank you and I’d like to invite General Milley.
General Milley: (06:54)
Thank you Secretary for those words and thank you Mr. President for your leadership and I want to publicly thank Admiral Craig Fowler, the commander of U.S. Southern Command out of Miami for leading this operation, which is underway effective today. And also at Admiral Gilday, the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Schultz for their contributions to this from their services. There’s thousands of sailors, Coast Guardsman, soldiers, airmen, Marines involved in this operation. We came upon some intelligence sometime ago that the drug cartels as a result of COVID-19 were going to try to take advantage of the situation and try to infiltrate additional drugs into our country. As we know that 70,000 Americans die on an average annual basis to drugs, that’s unacceptable. We’re at war with COVID-19, we’re at war with terrorists and we are at war with the drug cartels as well. This was the United States military, you will not penetrate this country. You will not get past jump street. You’re not going to come in here and kill additional Americans.
General Milley: (07:51)
And we will marshal whatever assets are required to prevent your entry into this country to kill Americans. So right now the Navy has marshaled additional grey hull ships from both PACOM and EUCOM and for the Naval fleet at Norfolk. And they are set sail already and they’re in the Caribbean right now. In addition to that, there’s 10 Coast Guard Cutters and there’s special operations forces and security force assistance brigades along with Air Force reconnaissance aircraft. The bottom line is you’re not going to get through. Now is not the time to try to penetrate the United States with illegal drugs to kill Americans. We’re the United States military and we will defend our country, regardless of the cost. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Secretary.
Donald Trump: (08:28)
Thank you General, thank you.
Bill Barr: (08:31)
Thank you, Mr. President, thanks for your decisive leadership as we confront this unprecedented challenge posed by coronavirus. And I’d like to thank you for your support for this important initiative and thank all of the, Secretary of Defense and all the services for taking on this important initiative. Obviously during this crisis, we’re all focused above all else on COVID-19 but at the same time, our law enforcement and national security work must go forward protecting the American people from the full array of threats. For the Department of Justice, one of our highest priorities must remain destroying the Mexican cartels. Their trafficking is largely responsible for the deaths, as we all know now, of 70,000 Americans a year. And also the cost of this don’t count the destroyed families, the destroyed lives, the draining of our national treasure as state budgets are crushed by the burden that this narcotic trafficking causes.
Bill Barr: (09:45)
The President has made clear that we are in this fight against the cartels to win and that we are not interested in half-measures. And that the threat posed by the cartel is not just a law enforcement threat, but a national security threat as well. And in December, building on your success with the Mexican president and forging a cooperative relationship in the area of immigration, you asked me to go down and meet with the President Lopez Obrador and our Mexican counterparts to see if we could also establish a more comprehensive and coordinated effort with the Mexicans in confronting the cartels. And we’ve had some successful visits and discussions and currently have an array of activities underway against the cartels and we anticipate along with the Mexicans that these are going to bear fruit in the months ahead.
Bill Barr: (10:45)
But it quickly became clear that we can obtain the most immediate results, the best bang for the buck, where we increase the assets involved in interdiction on both the Pacific and Atlantic side of Mexico in the Central American countries. For years, the cartels have been using these sea routes to take the cocaine up from principally Columbia, now also out of Venezuela. And these sea routes on both coasts have become the primary means of bringing cocaine up to the United States. Because of the superb work done by the Defense Department and our intelligence community, we know exactly most of the time where these traffickers are at sea. But we’re significantly have been up til now, significantly limited in our ability to interdict because of the numbers of the assets we have deployed.
Bill Barr: (11:45)
Prior today, this limitation meant we could only intercept the fraction of the traffickers and the various boats that were detected. This will now double our capacity and we are talking about hundreds of tons of cocaine we’re now in a position to seize. So this is going to radically improve our interdiction efforts and put tremendous pressure we think on the cartels. And the effort that SOUTHCOM is undertaking is going to save lives by taking drugs off the street. Last week, I announced the unsealing of charges of narco terrorism drug trafficking and other crimes against the former Maduro regime, 16 members of that regime and their involvement in trafficking of 250 metric tons a year. A lot of that comes by sea, as I discussed at that time, but also because of the pressure we’re applying by our sea interdiction. They are trying to establish an air route out of Venezuela up into Central America, which is one of the reasons we’re trying to move firmly against that corrupt regime.
Bill Barr: (12:59)
You know, this drug war has gone on for many decades and at times in the past we’ve had great success and great results and at times we’ve taken our eye off the ball. Fortunately not in this administration, and I’m grateful that you, Mr. President, have brought focus to this fight and the determination to use whatever tools are necessary to win the fight. The cartels have to be defeated both for the people of this country and for the people of Mexico and Venezuela. So I’d like to thank you again, Mr. President, Secretary Esper for providing the wherewithal required to help win this war against the cartels and others who seek to send elicit drugs into our country. And with that, I’d like to introduce Ambassador O’Brien.
Robert O’Brien: (13:50)
Thank you, General, thank you, Mr. President. Today’s action is another example of the bold leadership of President Trump and his commitment to protecting the homeland against threats that seek to destabilize the United States and our Western hemisphere. The uncontrolled flow of illegal drugs into the United States poisons our communities, fuels the dangerous epidemic, an epidemic of addiction and threatens the safety and security of all Americans. The impressive U.S. Navy Coast Guard, Army, Marine Corps, Air Force and inter-agency operation will address a range of threats to our national security posed by narco traffickers and narco terrorists. It will reduce list financial support for drug trafficking that provides the corrupt Maduro regime in Venezuela and other bad actors with the funds necessary to conduct their malign activities. Under President Trump’s leadership, we will continue to execute our maximum pressure policy to counter the Maduro regimes, malign activities including drug trafficking. And this operation will help to choke off the funds that go to that corrupt regime.
Robert O’Brien: (14:55)
Maduro, narco terrorists and criminals should make no mistake that even as we are working around the clock to fight the spread of coronavirus, we will continue to execute the President’s counter narcotic strategy. We’re working on a number of important national security priorities as we face this public health crisis. The United States will continue to combat disinformation and fake news about this virus. We will work with the world’s largest oil producers to address volatility in global oil markets. We will always protect our servicemen and servicewomen around the world, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. I want the American people to know that President Trump and Vice President Pence and their administration are working tirelessly every day to protect the health and wellbeing of Americans and respond to the coronavirus. Our adversaries should take note however, this President has a clear-eyed focus on America’s national security interest. And let me be clear, it would be a mistake, a mistake with terrible consequences for any adversary to attempt to do us harm during this health crisis or ever for that matter. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (16:07)
So do we have any questions on this? Because this group is going to go back to work, they’re going to leave.
Speaker 1: (16:13)
A question either for you, Mr. President or Secretary Esper, what has changed that is allowing these assets to be deployed now, whereas General Barr said in the past they were not [inaudible 00:16:23] ?
Donald Trump: (16:24)
Well, for a long time we’ve had a lot of drugs coming into our country and it’s not that it’s increased, we’ve probably got it down a little bit, but it’s still a tremendous number of families are being ruined, lives are being ruined. It’s an incredible thing, especially as you’re at this position, you would never believe it. I see things that nobody would believe. I see reports that nobody would believe. So I met with the group behind me, all of them, and we said, what do you think we can do? And they think they can interdict, they that think we can stop it before it gets to the shores and they’re coming from all over the place and we have incredibly talented people. So I think I’m going to let Mark just give him a little bit of an answer to that. But we just want to see if we can stop a good percentage of the drugs coming into our country.
Mark Esper: (17:14)
Sure thing, thanks Mr. President. So first of all, it’s simply a matter of prioritization. The President’s giving us very clear guidance on what’s important to him in protecting the American people. And as some of you know, I began to review months ago looking at all of our different geographic combatant commands and looking at where we can free up time, money, and resources to put into other endeavors. In this case, we had scrutinized our inventory fairly closely, that Chairman Milley did a great deal of work on this with Admiral Gilday and we felt that there was no risk to the fleet, to our operations to free up, in this case Naval ships. We also freed up aircraft and other assets to apply them to this presidential priority. And of course, the Coast Guard did the same, so it was a very good operation. We feel this is very important to the American people and completely in line with the President’s direction.
Speaker 1: (18:00)
And how long will you be able to keep up this operational tempo?
Mark Esper: (18:03)
Well, it depends. What we’re going to do is we’re going to run it for some matter of time. I’m not going to disclose how long that will be and then we will assess it and then we’ll make adjustments from there. We may increase, we may decrease, we may sustain as is, but this will be an assessment we will do as an inter-agency team. We will report back to the President and we’ll take further guidance from there.
Donald Trump: (18:22)
[inaudible 00:18:22] didn’t do it for this reason, but it’ll also have an impact on the virus because we have people trying to get in, so not only drugs, but now we have a new phenomena. And that’s at least for the next hopefully short period of time, the virus, so we’ll be able to have an impact on that too. Please.
Speaker 2: (18:36)
Yeah, Mr. President, could you expand on that a little bit because you tie it to COVID-19, saying that these drug cartels were taking advantage of the situation of this pandemic. How exactly-
Donald Trump: (18:47)
Well, because we’re focused on so many other parts of the country and even parts of the world. And all of a sudden, areas where we had it clamped down pretty tight, in all fairness, the wall is up to about 160 miles already. And any areas where we have that wall, it’s for the most part contiguous, we have fill-ins but we’re up to 161 miles exactly. And any place where you have that wall, other than walking around it on the edges, it’s stopping everybody cold. I mean, we’re stopping … Nobody’s seen anything like it, that’s how good it works. And the other side knew had worked that well. Everybody, because everybody was for it five years ago, all of a sudden they changed.
Donald Trump: (19:27)
It’s having a tremendous impact. But we are now focused on so many different things because of what’s happened, because of this horrible, I say it’s a horrible phenomena that now we’ve got to focus on drugs and the drugs come in from different methods and we have the best people at sea anywhere in the world. So we’ll have a tremendous impact on drugs. But one of the other things, we’ll also have an impact we think on the virus. Yeah, please.
Speaker 4: (19:54)
Ambassador O’Brien, did a China under report, both the number of cases and the death toll from the coronavirus. And if that’s the case, Mr. President, what does that mean for our relationship with China and your relationship with President Xi?
Robert O’Brien: (20:09)
Well number one, I think the President has a great relationship with President Xi, and we’d like to have a great relationship with China. Unfortunately, we’re just not in a position to confirm any of the numbers that are coming out of China. There is no way to confirm any of those numbers. There’s lots of public reporting on whether the numbers are too low. You’ve got access to those reports that are coming out of the Chinese social media and some of the few reporters that are left in China. We just have no way to confirm any of those numbers. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (20:34)
We really don’t know, how do we know whether they under reported or reported however they report. But we had a great call the other night. We’re working together on a lot of different things including trade. They’re buying a lot, they’re spending a lot of money and they’re giving it to our farmers. They’re paying our farmers for the product. So we’re going to continue that along. John, yeah.
Speaker 1: (20:55)
I have another one, sir. You tweeted earlier today that you have uncovered intelligence that there is a sneak attack being planned against American troops, America assets in Iraq. Are we talking about Kataib Hezbollah again? I’ll also-
Donald Trump: (21:10)
I know what you’re saying, but we just have information that they were planning something and it’s very good information. It was led by Iran, not necessarily Iran, but by groups supported by Iran, but that to me is Iran. And we’re just saying, don’t do it, don’t do it, it would be a very bad thing for them if they did it.
Speaker 1: (21:31)
The last time they did do it in early March at Camp Taji, there was a response from the military against Kataib Hezbollah alone, your tweets-
Donald Trump: (21:41)
I had a very powerful response by the way, that response knocked out five different places, but it also took out a lot of very bad people.
Speaker 1: (21:48)
Your tweets seem to suggest though that if it happens again, it may go up the food chain.
Donald Trump: (21:52)
Well, that was a very big response, we knocked out a lot. We looked at … they had one side, we hit five big ones and ammunition sites. You saw what happened, and I won’t say how many people were killed, but some bad people were killed and a lot of them. That was a big response. But this response will be bigger, if they do something. Yeah and you had one, please.
Speaker 3: (22:13)
Yes, thank you Mr. President. Just going back to your conversation with President Xi, wondering if you received an intelligence report that talked about the discrepancy in the numbers and if you addressed that with-
Donald Trump: (22:25)
We have not received that, but their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side and I’m being nice when I say that, relative to what we witnessed and what was reported. But we discussed that with him, not so much the numbers, as what they did and how they’re doing. And we’re in constant communication with the … I mean, I would say the biggest communication is myself and President Xi. The relationship’s very good. Look, they will be spending when things even out, this is obviously a little bit of a hurdle what’s happened over the last month, but they’ll be spending $250 billion buying our product. $50 billion to the farmers alone, $200 billion to other things. They never did that before. So we have a great trade deal and we’d like to keep it. They’d like to keep it and the relationship is good. As to whether or not their numbers are accurate, I’m not an accountant from China.
Speaker 3: (23:26)
[inaudible 00:23:26] things at all in terms of the trade deals?
Donald Trump: (23:28)
No, because people just don’t know. People don’t know. Where did it come from? I think we all understand where it came from and President Xi understands that and we don’t have to make a big deal out of it. We didn’t like the fact that they said it came from our soldiers and they haven’t pursued that. And that a mid-level person said that, that was not a high level person. So I will always assume the best. I’ll assume the high level people didn’t know about it. It was a foolish statement. So look, the relationship with China is a good one and my relationship with him is really good. Please.
Speaker 7: (24:03)
Can I follow up just on that point on Chinese propaganda that you mentioned as well as an Ambassador O’Brien. So in the past several weeks, China has been shipping PPEs, masks. They’ve either been selling or donating everywhere, Africa, Europe, Italy, Russia, and really pushing this narrative that they’re taking on a global leadership role in the crisis. So what are your thoughts on that and is there any plan for your administration to take on that role?
Donald Trump: (24:27)
Oh, I don’t mind if they want … Yeah, I feel that is a positive if they’re helping other countries. We have 151 countries right now that are under siege by the virus, under siege. Some are doing really badly, they don’t know about social distancing. These are countries that aren’t highly sophisticated. They don’t have great communication to the rest of the world. I mean, they don’t know the things that we’re doing and that some others are able to do. And if China can help them, I’m all for it. I’m for all of us helping everybody. We’re soon going to have more ventilators than we need. We’re building thousands of ventilators right now. Now, it takes a period of time to build them. And again, nobody could have known a thing like this could happen. We’re building thousands. We will fairly soon be at a point where we have far more than we can use. Even after we stockpile for some future catastrophe, which we hope doesn’t happen. We’re going to be distributed them, the extras around the world. We’ll go to Italy, we’ll go to France, we’ll go to Spain, which is very hard hit.
Speaker 7: (25:29)
On that note, is there any truth on reporting that your administration is stopping shipment of USAID stockpiles of PPEs abroad?
Donald Trump: (25:36)
No, no truth whatsoever.
Speaker 7: (25:38)
So your administration is not-
Donald Trump: (25:38)
I would love China and other countries if they have additional supplies, medical supplies to give to other countries. 151, why would I stop that? Wouldn’t it be terrible to stop it?
Speaker 7: (25:51)
Is the U.S. stopping shipment of our own stockpile through USAID to other countries?
Donald Trump: (25:56)
Whatever we have, whatever we’ve committed to, we commit, but we also need a lot for ourselves, so we’re very focused on that until we get over this. So obviously, we’re not going to be shipping too much until now. We do have excess of certain things and we don’t have enough of others. I just had a great talk today with Doug McMillan from Walmart and I gave him a very, very big order for gowns, for protective gear, for the doctors, for the nurses, for everything. And he’s actually very excited about it. He’s the biggest purchaser of this kind of thing. I mean of anything probably in the world. And he is very excited about it. And he said, what size? I said, it’s almost an unlimited.
Donald Trump: (26:39)
When you look at these hospitals, the amount that they order, you almost say, how could they possibly use so much, whether it’s masks or the protective gear. But we are supplying a tremendous amount and we just ordered a lot from Walmart. And he’s taken this on personally. And I said, let it be shipped not to a warehouse directly to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it because we save a lot of-
Donald Trump: (27:03)
Play to the side of the hospital or wherever they need it because we save a lot of time when we do that. So Walmart, in addition to many other companies and people, is now involved at the highest level. Please.
Speaker 8: (27:14)
The announcements that were made today are aimed at curbing the flow of narcotics into the country. Are you concerned that we’re possibly losing ground on the drug crisis while we’re…
Donald Trump: (27:24)
I don’t think we’re losing ground, but we don’t want to lose ground. That’s why we’re doing it. I don’t want to lose ground. It’s a big fight. I’ve seen many families where they’re wiped out because they lost a son or a daughter or a husband or a wife or whatever. Or all of them and we don’t want to lose ground and we are heavily focused on the virus, very heavily focused. After this goes into effect, which essentially is now, we will never have been so focused on drugs coming into our country as we are right now. And remember, as that wall gets bigger, that really helps us a lot. Really helps us a lot. Yeah, please.
Mark Esper: (27:59)
Is the Mexican government or any other Latin American government working in conjunction with this operation to help with that drug?
Donald Trump: (28:06)
Many of the governments are, and Mexico in particular is. In Mexico right now, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border keeping people out of our country and very few people are coming into our country right now and as we complete, again the wall, in addition to the 27,000 soldiers, it’s a very tough place to come into.
Donald Trump: (28:30)
When I took over, people were coming in and they were bringing whatever they wanted. They were bringing drugs of any type and now, it’s very hard for them. And it will get harder and harder. But the president of Mexico is a great guy who has really helped us a lot. 27,000 Mexican soldiers. And you remember when I first took over, they had all of the caravans coming up with 10,000, 15,000 people in the caravans. They were marching through Mexico. That’s not happening anymore. Please, in the back?
Speaker 9: (29:02)
Mr President, are narco-militants such as the FARC 57th Front out of Columbia or the Maduro regime, do you know if they’re working in conjunction with the Mexican cartels? Is there any intelligence indicating that?
Donald Trump: (29:16)
I cannot tell you. I know the answer to that, I believe I do, but I cannot tell you that. We have information that would lead us to believe something very powerfully. But I cannot tell you the answer to that. Yeah, please? [inaudible 00:29:33]
Speaker 10: (29:33)
Mr President, have US forces in Iraq taken the precautions because of this particular attack? And have you…
Donald Trump: (29:39)
Sure. They’re taking precautions and we are watching it very closely and if something bad happens, it’s going to be very painful for the other side.
Speaker 10: (29:47)
Have you been in touch with the Iraqi government about this?
Donald Trump: (29:50)
They know about it. Yeah. They know.
Speaker 10: (29:52)
Are they offering additional protection?
Donald Trump: (29:53)
We’ll see. We’ll see what happens, but we’re down to a small force now over the years. Since I got, we’ve been bringing smaller and smaller, and we’re down right now to a small number, but we have very powerful air power there. We have the big base. I mean, nobody can get near it. Nobody can even get near that. But we’ve really largely left, we’ve taken tremendous amounts out and we’ve deployed them elsewhere, including bringing some back home.
Speaker 10: (30:28)
And do you think tweeting about it will help prevent that from happening? Or perhaps [crosstalk 00:30:32]
Donald Trump: (30:34)
It’s social media, it gets out. I have hundreds of millions of people, number one on Facebook. Did you know I was number one on Facebook? I just found out I’m number one on Facebook. I thought that was very nice, for whatever it means. It represents something and when I can explain to people just don’t do it. It’s going to be bad if you do, it’s going to be really bad and they don’t need to do it, they have enough problems. Iran has enough problems without doing that. But we’ve been pulling back very substantially over the last year in Iraq. And so, that’s the way it is.
Speaker 10: (31:08)
You said before, you don’t want to give the enemy, whoever that is in this case, a heads up, do you feel like maybe you did?
Donald Trump: (31:16)
No, I’m just giving them a warning, it’s not a heads up. I’m giving them a warning. There’s a big difference. I’m saying if you do anything to hurt our troops, they’re going to pay a price. Now, as per the question, they did last time. We didn’t make a big deal out of it, but we hit very, very hard five massive major ammunition sites and a lot of people went with it. A lot of bad people. A lot of enemy went with it and we didn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but they paid a big price. They’ll pay a much bigger price this time if they do anything.
Speaker 11: (31:49)
Now that we have Admiral Gilday here, perhaps we could ask a question about what the plans are for the Roosevelt, sir?
Donald Trump: (31:55)
Sure.
Admiral Gilday: (31:59)
In terms of Roosevelt, we’re making great progress in terms of testing and also moving people off the ship. So, in the past day or so, we’ve moved over a thousand. That number will increase to more than 2,700 by Friday, as we continue to increase the testing as well and fly those samples off. So again, pretty quickly.
Speaker 11: (32:19)
And will the ship remain fully operational?
Admiral Gilday: (32:21)
It is fully operational now.
Speaker 11: (32:23)
And will remain so?
Admiral Gilday: (32:24)
It will remain so.
Speaker 12: (32:26)
Just a followup to that, what protocols are you putting in place to help mitigate the spread of coronavirus among service men and women who live [crosstalk 00:32:33].
Admiral Gilday: (32:33)
Across the fleet, before we have any ships getting underway for training exercises, for deployments, those sailors are spending 14 days in quarantine before they get underway. We’ve increased the amount of testing equipment as well as physicians on board our ships at sea. So, we’ve taken additional steps since the beginning of the COVID crisis.
Donald Trump: (32:52)
Not too many people are going to be getting off at various ports anymore. Right? I think we-
Admiral Gilday: (32:59)
Correct.
Donald Trump: (32:59)
We probably have decided on that.
Speaker 12: (33:03)
You mean civilians?
Donald Trump: (33:04)
Thank you. No, military people, on ships.
Mark Esper: (33:09)
I’d like to add one thing to that. There seems to be this narrative out there that we should just shut down the entire United States military and address the problem that way. That’s not feasible. We have a mission. Our mission is to protect the United States of America and our people. And so, we live and work in cramped quarters, whether it’s an aircraft carrier, a submarine, a tank, a bomber, it’s the nature of our business. But the chain of command has very clear guidance and I’m confident between the commanding officers and the senior non-commissioned officers, they’re taking every reasonable precaution to make sure we practice as best we can, social distancing, sanitizing environments, et cetera, consistent with that mission. And that’s what I trust Admiral Gilday, acting Secretary Modly and all the other service chiefs and service leaders to do. And I’m confident we’ll do that, because keep in mind, we have a job to do and we will continue to do it. Defend the United States of America.
Speaker 13: (33:57)
Mr President, you mentioned the stockpile earlier, the Washington Post reported today that the US stockpile is nearly depleted of PPE. Is that the case? And if so, how are you planning to mitigate?
Donald Trump: (34:06)
It is because we’re sending directly to hospitals. We don’t want it to come to the stockpile because then we have to take it after it arrives and bring it to various states and hospitals. One of the things, and again, we asked the states to do this as much as possible, many of the states have people that, whether it’s that or clothing, they make clothing, lots of clothing in many of the different states. We said, “See if you can get it directly from those manufacturers, make a deal, we’ll use the purchase act if we have to on them, if they won’t.” By the way, so many people are… The spirit is incredible, what they’re doing, but we’ve asked States where they have large manufacturers of different types of equipment to use those local factories, those local plants, and have it made directly, ship it right into the hospitals. We’re shipping things right in.
Donald Trump: (34:54)
We have, as you know, almost 10,000 ventilators, which we need for flexibility. It’s a lot. It sounds like a lot, but it’s not because as you see on the board from yesterday, as this scourge, as this plague, as this virus moves, it moves very fast and we don’t know yet whether we’re going to need it in Louisiana, in New York, wherever it may be. So we’re ready for it. We’re totally ready for it. We’re going to be shipping out, we’ve already agreed to ship out over a thousand today to different sites, different locations, but we have to have the flexibility of moving the ventilators to where the virus is going. And we’ll be able to see that from charts a couple of days in advance. So right now, we have a nice pile of ventilators.
Donald Trump: (35:39)
We have a lot more coming in. I think we have 11 companies making ventilators right now. Very good companies and they’re making them. You know about Ford, you know about General Motors, but we have a lot of companies making the ventilators right now. So, now the question is, when you make one, it doesn’t get made in 15 minutes. A mask can go quickly, a ventilator takes time to build. It’s very, very, as we discussed, it’s complex, it’s big, gets expensive, et cetera. But we’ll be able to move. We have great flexibility. John?
John: (36:13)
I was just going to say, sir, do you want to move on to solely coronavirus or stick with-
Donald Trump: (36:17)
Yeah, I think if… Does anybody have any other questions for this great group of brilliant people? Yes, please?
Speaker 14: (36:24)
Thank you, Mr President. Question for Secretary Asper. The military personnel has been fanned out across the country to help combat the virus, is there any chance that they’re planning to see at some point having military personnel treat or see COVID-19 patients?
Mark Esper: (36:42)
Well, excuse me. As you know, we have the hospital ships currently deployed, one in LA and one in New York city. So, they could be treating patients as they come in. We’re taking precautionary measures to screen them beforehand to make sure that they’re not exposed, if you will. Same with the military hospitals that we’re deploying, certainly again to New York, Seattle, and other places. But the one thing we got to be careful of is that these are deployable assets. They are unique.
Mark Esper: (37:08)
So, if we want to retain the ability to deploy military doctors, expeditionary military hospitals around the country, we’ve got to preserve and protect them as best we can. That said, we remain completely available to assist as need be, as directed by FEMA, as the vice president and the president asks us, that’s what we commit to do to the American people to help safeguard them and protect them through this virus.
Speaker 14: (37:30)
So as part of that, will they be seeing coronavirus patients or will they strictly be seeing other patients and helping them?
Mark Esper: (37:36)
They could if called upon. I think the best use for them is based on their training and how they’re structured and organized is for trauma. We can take the load off of hospitals with regard to their trauma patients, thereby freeing up rooms and other doctors, particularly doctors who are respiratory nurses or doctors who deal with infectious disease to treat those types of patients. So, I think it’s the best use of our resources. But again, if push comes to shove, we’re prepared to do what we have to, to assist the American people. At the same time preserving the medical capability we need to support our operation deployed forces abroad.
Donald Trump: (38:09)
We’re looking at doing two additional brand new hospital ships because these ships have really struck a blow, a very positive blow for what they’re doing. Going into Los Angeles, going into New York. So, we’re looking very seriously at building two additional ships of about the same size.
Speaker 14: (38:30)
Building two new ones or deploying two new ones?
Donald Trump: (38:32)
Well, building but we’re looking at building either two new ones or doing the renovation of another large ship. But this has really worked out well. So probably two brand new ones. [crosstalk 00:38:42]
Donald Trump: (38:42)
Is this concerning the gentleman or do you want them… You don’t want them to get back to work and capture all those bad people?
Speaker 15: (38:51)
A followup Mr President or Mr Secretary, I know that Secretary Wilkie has said he’s on standby waiting to hear if VA hospitals doors need to be opened to civilians. Are you talking about that? [crosstalk 00:39:04] Could we see that? How soon could that happen?
Donald Trump: (39:07)
Yeah, it can move very quickly. He’s a very capable man. We’re ready to move very quickly. As an example, in Louisiana, they have a very big hospital, so we’re looking to move very quickly. If we need them. Hopefully we won’t need them.
Speaker 15: (39:20)
[crosstalk 00:39:20] soon?
Donald Trump: (39:20)
We’re going to find out pretty soon. We’re only going to know at the time it happens. We prepare for the worst. We are preparing for the worst. Unfortunately, that’s the way we have to look at it.
Speaker 16: (39:31)
Just to followup on the purpose of these Naval ships, you mentioned something about treating trauma patients and I’m just curious, what about things like giving birth? Would mothers be expected in New York for example?
Donald Trump: (39:43)
Well, as I understand, they’re not doing that on the ship. That’s the one thing they’re not doing outside of the COVID-19. They’re not doing that. The birth of a baby not being done on the ships.
Speaker 16: (39:54)
Okay. Can I have a followup question with attorney general Barr please? This has to do with the visa restrictions of immigrant doctors. Is the administration considering easing the restrictions or waving restrictions for doctors with J1 or H-1 B visas so they can help other doctors during this crisis?
William Barr: (40:16)
Actually, the immigration laws are no longer under the administration of the Department of justice and I haven’t been participating in any of those discussions.
Speaker 16: (40:25)
What about you, Mr President? Can you respond to that question, Mr President? [crosstalk 00:40:28]
Donald Trump: (40:27)
One more for this group right here, please.
Speaker 16: (40:32)
Secretary Esper, this is on the topic of coronavirus in Iran, the WHO confirms that Iran is vastly under reporting its coronavirus cases. Not just cases, but fatalities. According to on the ground estimates, that might be as high as 15 and a half thousand deaths. 32 commanders in the military in Iran are now confirmed either in dire condition or dead. You have eight percent of the parliament now down with coronavirus. So, is Iran’s soundings of aggressions today, that President Trump just tweeted about, do you think strategically, is that a bluff on their part or is this a sign of very clear desperation? Where are you strategically on that?
Mark Esper: (41:15)
Well, first and foremost, we empathize for the Iranian people. I mean, they clearly have been hit hard as you know. I think the president’s spoken about it, certainly Secretary Pompeo. We’ve offered assistance, we’ve offered medical supplies, et cetera. They have refused that. I think if the Iranian regime put more interest in terms of taking care of their people in the context of this virus, they would be better served. Instead, the Iranian regime continues to want to spread its malign activities throughout the region. They want to continue to send out the [inaudible 00:14:42] force and others to cause problems throughout the region.
Mark Esper: (41:46)
We know that in one way, shape or form, they either, resourcing, directing, approving or whatever operations for Shia militia groups in Iraq that are targeting American forces. So I think at the end of the day, again, I feel deep concern for the Iranian people, the important thing is the Iranian government should focus on them and stop this malign behavior that they’ve been conducting now for over 40 years. I think the entire region and certainly the Iranian people would be better off for it.
Donald Trump: (42:15)
And I happen to think they want to make a deal. They just don’t know really how to start and they’ve been given some bad advice by former Secretary Kerry. It’s a very bad advice and I really think they want to make a deal, which is the Logan act, but we’d have to look at the Logan act. All you have to do is take a look. I think they’ve been given very bad advice by Secretary Kerry. I think they’re dying to make a deal. Look, their country’s in trouble. Their economics are shot. They’ve got a lot of bad things going. I think they’d like to make a deal. They can get it settled very quickly. No nuclear weapons. They can’t have nuclear weapons. It’s very simple. Okay, let’s let these folks get back to work. Is that okay? Thank you all very much.
Donald Trump: (43:16)
So as we deploy our service members to combat both threats abroad, invisible enemy at home, earlier today I spoke to our nation’s incredible warriors and military families. Spent a long time of the phone with thousands and thousands of families that were hooked in. In order to stop the spread of the virus, some of these families have delayed planned moves to their next duty station and in other cases, military families are also waiting longer to welcome home the heroes from deployment. There’s a tremendous burden to bear and the families have been involved with us for so long and they are incredible. Without the families, they couldn’t be the great service members that they turned out to be. And they understand that. And I must say, protecting our military families is our top priority.
Donald Trump: (44:07)
So, they understand what’s happening with respect to the virus and they understand it well. They’ve been fantastic. As commander in chief, I’m deeply grateful for our service members, their spouses and their children, whose love, devotion and sacrifice keeps America strong. To make, procure and deliver a crucial medical supplies to our doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers, my administration is leveraging the might of American manufacturing supply chains and innovators across the industry and across every industry and I just told you about Walmart and I could tell you about many more. Hanes is making protective gear and masks and we’re making tremendous amounts of product.
Donald Trump: (44:54)
There’s never been anything like it. At the same time, I tell the governors, get it yourself if you can from your local companies and your local warehouses and factories. If you can do that, you should do that. Because of the actions that we’ve taken under the Defense Production Act, manufacturers and suppliers are sharing with FEMA and HHS their planned orders and allocations to states and to hospitals all over the region. This enables FEMA and HHS to work closely with states, local governments and private sector to allocate critical resources to highly impacted areas. Working together, we’re entirely focused on getting materials to the right place at the right time. So, we wanted to go directly to a hospital or directly to a certain state location and ideally, not even hit the state’s warehouses. If we can avoid the warehouses, it’s even better because they go directly into a hospital.
Donald Trump: (45:50)
And one example of that is Ohio, the great state of Ohio. Senator Rob Portman called today and he asked for some help and got us… Did a tremendous job along with Mike DeWine, the great governor of Ohio, to facilitate a donation of 2.2 million gowns. 2.2 million gowns, think of what that is, 2.2 million to the strategic national stockpile from Ohio based Cardinal health. Cardinal health, we appreciate it and they’re making much more than that and different types of things.
Donald Trump: (46:27)
We’re profoundly grateful for their contribution to protect the lives and safety of our healthcare professionals. Cardinal’s been working with us very well. FEMA and HHS formed a historic partnership with a private sector called Project Airbridge to bring supplies from other countries to the United States, including gloves, gowns, goggles and masks. These supplies will soon be distributed around the country. We have large cargo planes coming in from various parts of the world. Every day, new plane loads are landing in cities such as New York, Miami, Chicago, Los Angeles.
Donald Trump: (47:03)
Additional flights have been scheduled and we’re adding more and more and they’re actually coming in ahead of schedule. A lot of these flights are coming in with a lot of material ahead of schedule, The amount of usage, the amount of need is something that nobody’s ever seen before. We are getting so much, but no matter how much we get, they seem to use it up very quickly. More than 17,000 national guard personnel have now been activated all across our country. On Tuesday, the vice-president sent a letter to the governors calling on them to have plans in place to use the national guard to move medical supplies from warehouses to hospitals. So, a lot of times we’ll deliver supplies to our in a state, someplace in New York or in New Jersey or in Connecticut or wherever it may be, and they’re having difficulty getting it moved.
Donald Trump: (47:57)
So what we’re doing, if we don’t bring it directly to the hospital, is we’ve authorized, it was a special authorization, the national guard to go into that facility and to move it for the state. So, the national guard is moving a lot of this equipment and medical supplies into a hospital or into an area where it’s needed by the state. As I said yesterday, difficult days are ahead for our nation. We’re going to have a couple of weeks, starting pretty much now, but especially a few days from now that are going to be horrific, but even in the most challenging of times, Americans do not despair. We do not give into fear. We pull together, we persevere and we overcome and we win. This week, every American heart is joined with the people of New York as they continue to bear the brunt of the pandemic. To every New Yorker, please know that we are by your side.
Donald Trump: (48:56)
I love New York and every day we will be with you and it could very well be that others take over from New York. There are some areas, some hotspots in other States that are really exploding. Some, like Louisiana, were very late and then all of a sudden, it was like an explosion. In confronting this deadly plague, America’s armed with capabilities never dreamed of in past centuries. You look at 1917, the pandemic, it was something. Ravaged parts of this country, but ravaged Europe. Ravaged. They say 75 to 100 million, some people say 50 to 75 million people died. Think of that and that was a long time ago, over a hundred years ago. Many books written about the 1917, 1918 pandemic.
Donald Trump: (49:58)
Our doctors are pouring over the virus. Genetic code, designing potential therapies and vaccines. Our planes are airlifting supplies from every corner of the earth. We’re watching other countries and they’re watching us to see whether or not, and who’s going to be the first to come up with a cure or a remedy of some kind or even a help, if it can help.
Donald Trump: (50:21)
And of course, a vaccine. We’re looking very strongly for a vaccine. Johnson and Johnson is doing well and other companies are doing very well. But our most powerful asset, our greatest weapon in this effort is the spirit of our people and we want to keep away, keep a distance, keep away. If you don’t get it, it solves a lot of problems. If you don’t get it, and you can’t get it if you keep the distance. American spirit is unyielding, unwavering and unbreakable. It’s incredible. I’ve never seen anything like it. The way the people have pulled together, the unity of this country. So, together we’re going to win this war and the sooner we do, the sooner we can begin to rebuild and we’re ready to rebound and return to normal lives. We went from the best economy of the history of the world, the best economy that this country has ever seen, the best employment numbers we’ve ever had.
Donald Trump: (51:18)
160 million people working, almost 160 million to a point where the professionals came to me and they say, “Sir, you’re going to have to shut the country down.” I said, ” What does that mean?” They said, “Sir, you’re going to have to shut it down.” And we’re going to build it up and I think we’re going to build it up fast. I think we’re going to have a tremendous rebound. There’s a great energy and a great pent up demand, and as you know, phase three was terrific and phase four, what passed in Congress, and phase four if that happens will be great.
Donald Trump: (51:55)
I already proposed paying almost zero interest on bonds and I proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which would not only fix our roads and highways and bridges and tunnels and other things, but will also do something very good, it’s called jobs. I’m also asking that restaurants and entertainment facilities go back to the old deductibility from corporations, where corporations can buy, because otherwise a lot of these restaurants have got to have a hard time reopening. It takes a long time and they’re going to have a hard time reopening. So we’re asking for going back to deductibility where corporations can buy and corporations can go out to lunch and they pay and they get a deduction on what they eat. They get a deduction on the bill, and same with the entertainment. It’s going to bring a lot of people back. I think it’ll open up the restaurant business.
Donald Trump: (52:48)
People forget that years ago they had that and when they got rid of it, when they ended it for whatever reason, but they ended it, many, many restaurants went out of business. Many entertainment type facilities went out of business and now’s a great time to bring it back. It was a terrible time for that business after they ended it, but this is a great time to bring it back. It’ll keep our restaurants going. In fact, I think the restaurant business will be actually bigger and better than it is right now. So, we’re also talking about that. And now, what we’ll do is we’ll take some questions and I see Mike is back with some of the folks. That’s great, Dr Fauci. And we will… Oh, how are you? Thank you Debra. So we’ll take some questions and we make progress day by day. Please?
Speaker 9: (53:38)
Mr President, yesterday you were talking about a friend you had who was in a coma. I’m sorry to hear your friend’s going through that, but you said this is no flu. There’s still some people who kind of think of this as a flu and over the past month, you’ve compared it to the flu sometimes, saying treat it like the flu or [inaudible 00:53:56] we handle the flu. So what changed your thinking on that? Well, your language on that?
Donald Trump: (54:01)
I think the severity. I think also in looking at the…
Reporter 1: (54:03)
… thinking on that. Who are you aligning with on that?
Donald Trump: (54:03)
I think the severity. I think, also, in looking at the way that the contagion… It is so contagious. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this where large groups of people, all of a sudden just by being in the presence of somebody having… The flu has never been like that. Flu is contagious, but nothing like we’ve ever seen here. Also the violence of it. If it hits the right person, and you know what those stats are. If it hits the right person, that person’s in deep trouble. And my friend was the right person.
Reporter 1: (54:33)
When you heard about that, with your friend, was that a turning point?
Donald Trump: (54:36)
No. Not a turning point. Before then, I knew how… Because I’m seeing numbers that I’m seeing, statistics that are not exactly very good. But it hit him very hard. He’s strong. A very strong kind of a guy, but he’s older, he’s heavier, and he’s sort of central casting for what we’re talking about, and it hit him very hard. I’ve never seen anything like it. Yeah, [John 00:55:01] .
John: (55:01)
Mr. President, and maybe this is a question as well for Dr. Birx or Dr. Fauci, Senator Lindsey Graham tweeted last night, and we checked today that there are still flights that are running between the hotspots like New York and Detroit, New Orleans as well. A number of flights were completed today. Senator Graham’s point is, if you’re going to declare mitigation, should it not be full mitigation, and you stop people from traveling?
Donald Trump: (55:26)
Well, we’re thinking about doing that. At the same time we just… to start these airlines and to start this whole thing over again is very tough, john. It’s very tough. And you have them going, in some cases, from hotspot to hotspot. If you notice, they’re usually hotspot to hotspot. Very few flights, New York to Miami, but we’re certainly looking at it, but once you do that, you really are clamping down an industry that is desperately needed.
John: (55:58)
But how do you make that calculation as to whether or not you keep the industry going-
Donald Trump: (56:01)
Well, we’re going to.
John: (56:01)
Are your risks spreading to change that?
Donald Trump: (56:03)
That is a calculation that we’re looking at right now. We’re looking at it very strongly. Please.
Reporter 3: (56:07)
So let me follow up to that, Mr. President. Not every governor has issued a stay at home order. All of you have made it very clear how important it is to stay home, that we are in a dire situation here. And that’s how you stop the spread, is the staying home.
Donald Trump: (56:22)
Yeah, sure.
Reporter 3: (56:22)
Why not take the power out of the hands of the governors, and you just issue a stay at home order for every state in this country?
Donald Trump: (56:31)
Because states are different, and I understand that the Governor of Florida, great governor, Ron DeSantis issued one today, and that’s good, that’s great. But there are some states that are different. There are some States that don’t have much of a problem. There are some, well, they don’t have the problem. They don’t have thousands of people that are positive or thousands of people that even think they might have it or hundreds of people in some cases.
Donald Trump: (56:58)
So you have to look at states. You have to give a little bit of flexibility. We have a state in the Midwest, or if Alaska as an example, doesn’t have a problem, it’s awfully tough to say close it down. So we have to have a little bit of flexibility. Look, we’re helping governors. We’re really here to help governors. They’re the front line of attack, and that includes in purchasing, by the way. We’re here, and we’re backing them up, and there’s never been a backup like we’ve given them. We’ve given them billions of dollars worth of things, medical supplies and ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators. We have thousands under construction right now. We have thousands ready to go in case they need it. There’s never been anything like this.
Donald Trump: (57:43)
They’ve done, really, the people, have done incredibly. We’re building hospitals all over the country. We’re building hospitals right now at a rate that has never even been contemplated before. They’re mobile hospitals, but they’re really not mobile. They’re incredible structures, but we’re building many hospitals. Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, we just finished a massive hospital complex. And we also have medical centers built in New York. We’re building hospitals at the rate that this country has never done before. And hopefully it’s all going to work out.
Reporter 4: (58:20)
Thank you sir. Mr. President, I just want to make sure we’re clear, on the planes. Are you looking at just curtailing routes between certain hotspots or is it broadly?
Donald Trump: (58:31)
We’re looking at the whole thing because we’re getting into a position now where we want to do that, we have to do that, and so we’re looking at the whole thing and we may have some recommendations.
Reporter 4: (58:41)
My second question on economics, just with oil, oil prices are very low. The Saudis have increased production. I know that you’ve spoken about liking low oil prices, but then there’s also the industry aspect-
Donald Trump: (58:55)
From 1950, these are oil prices. And that’s when they had big dollars. Big, beautiful dollars.
Reporter 4: (59:00)
So do you advocate cuts? Do you advocate cuts to production? Do you…
Donald Trump: (59:05)
Look, we have a great oil industry, and the oil industry is being ravaged. And, as you know, Russia, and I spoke to President Putin, we had a great call, Russia, Saudi Arabia. I spoke with the Crown Prince. We had a great call. But I think that they will work it out over the next few days. If you ask me, I think it’s too simple not to be able to. They both know what they have to do. So I think I have confidence in both that they’ll be able to work it out.
Donald Trump: (59:34)
But it has ravaged an industry worldwide not here, I mean worldwide, the oil industry has been ravaged. So there was a lot of oil production to start off with, and then on top of it, it got hit with the virus, and business went down 35, 40% so that that business is a tough one. And they have ships all over the sea. I told you yesterday, all over the sea, massive tankers that they are using for storage. They go out, and they just sit there. There’s no place to go. They have massive amounts.
Donald Trump: (01:00:07)
Now gasoline is going to be 99 cents a gallon and less. You know that. That’s already starting. It’s popping up, 99 cents. So that’s like giving a massive tax cut to people of our country when. We try and get the airlines going, if fuel is costing much less, it helps with getting the airlines, which is always a tough business, always has been a tough business. But with that being said, look, I want to get that industry back where it was. We were doing records in that industry, also. We want to get it back to where it was. So I think that Saudi Arabia, Russia, they’re negotiating, they’re talking, and I think they’ll come up with something.
Donald Trump: (01:00:46)
I’m going to meet with the oil companies on Friday. I’m going to meet with the independent oil producers also on Friday or Saturday, maybe Sunday, but we’re having a lot of meetings on it. I think I know what to do to solve it, but if they’re unable to solve it, then I think I know what to do to solve it.
Reporter 4: (01:01:06)
Can you give us a glimpse-
Donald Trump: (01:01:07)
We won’t mention it now, but it’s tough. I think I know what to do to solve it. We don’t want to lose our great oil companies. You know, we’re the number one producer of oil in the world, and a month ago when you said that it was great. Today when you say it, it’s not so meaningful. But I do believe there’s a way that that can be solved or pretty well solved. And I’d rather not do that.
Donald Trump: (01:01:32)
I think that Russia and Saudi Arabia, at some point, they’re going to make a deal in the not too distant future because it’s very bad for Russia. It’s very bad for Saudi Arabia. It’s very bad. I mean, it’s bad for both, so I think they’re going to make a deal. You know, the free market is a wonderful thing. It’s amazing how it could work, but I think they’re going to make a deal. Yeah, please. Over there.
Reporter 5: (01:01:56)
Mr. President, a couple of questions. One for you, one for Mr. Wolf, if possible. Over 5 million immigrants in this country do pay taxes through their ID numbers, yet they will not receive any money in their stimulus package, and no undocumented immigrant will receive any aid from the government during this crisis. How do you suppose they survive during the COVID-19?
Donald Trump: (01:02:19)
Well, when you’re saying undocumented, meaning they came in illegally, and a lot of people would say we have a lot of citizens right now that won’t be working. So what are you going to do? It’s a tough thing. It’s a very terrible… It’s a very sad question. I must be honest with you. But they came in illegally, and we have a lot of people that are citizens of our country that won’t be able to have jobs. Now, I do think, once we get rid of the virus, I think we’re going to have a boom economy.
Donald Trump: (01:02:48)
I think it’s going to go up rather quickly, maybe very quickly and maybe slowly, but it’s going to go up and it’ll all come back. And I think it’s actually going to come back stronger than what it was because of the stimulus. But it’s a really a sad situation, and we are working on it. I will tell you, I’m not going to give you a hard and fast answer because I just want to tell you, it’s something I think about, and it’s something we’re working on. Please.
Reporter 5: (01:03:16)
[crosstalk 01:03:16] Mr. Wolf?
Donald Trump: (01:03:16)
Go ahead.
Reporter 5: (01:03:16)
Thanks Mr. President. Question for Dr. Fauci. Looking beyond when we’re on the other side of this curve, are we looking at living with some sort of social distancing guidelines essentially until there’s treatment or a vaccine. For example, people looking forward to the summer talk about going to baseball games, going to concerts. We have political conventions over the summer. Are things like that possible or safe without a vaccine or a treatment in place?
Dr. Fauci: (01:03:44)
Yeah, I think if we get to the part of the curve that Dr. Birx showed yesterday, when it goes down to essentially no new cases, no deaths at a period of time, I think it makes sense that you’re going to have to relax social distancing. The one thing we hopefully would have in place, and I believe we will have in place, is a much more robust system to be able to identify someone who’s infected, isolate them, and then do contact tracing.
Dr. Fauci: (01:04:14)
Because if you have a really good program of containment that prevents you from ever having to get into mitigation… We’re in mitigation right now. That’s what the social and physical distancing is. The ultimate solution to a virus that might keep coming back would be a vaccine. In fact, I was on the weekly conference call with the WHO sponsored group of all the health leaders in the world who are dealing with this, and we all came to the agreement that we may have cycling with another season. We’ll be much better prepared. We likely will have interventions, but the ultimate game changer in this will be a vaccine, the same way a vaccine for other diseases, that were scourges in the past, that now we don’t even worry about.
Reporter 5: (01:05:04)
[crosstalk 01:05:04] the vaccine?
Dr. Fauci: (01:05:07)
The vaccine is, as I said, it’s on target. We’re still in Phase 1. There were three doses that we had to test. We’d been through the first two doses. We’re on the highest dose now. When we get that data, it’ll take a few months to get the data to feel confident to go to the Phase 2, and then a few months from now we’ll be in Phase 2. And I think we’re right on target for the year to a year and a half. .
Reporter 6: (01:05:29)
If you don’t mind me asking, you and Dr. Birx, have either of you received threats of any kind or have you been given a security detail, given that you’ve been out here every day on camera speaking?
Dr. Fauci: (01:05:40)
Well, anything that has to do with security detail, I’d have to have you refer that question to the Inspector General of HHS rather than my answer to that.
Reporter 7: (01:05:49)
Can you follow up on testing- [crosstalk 01:05:51]
Donald Trump: (01:05:52)
He doesn’t need security. Everybody loves him.
Reporter 7: (01:05:53)
Can you follow up on testing Dr. Fauci?
Donald Trump: (01:05:55)
[crosstalk 01:05:55] says that they would be in big trouble if they ever attack. You know, he was a great basketball player. Did anybody know that? He was a little on the short side for the NBA, but he was talented. I read this, he won a game that was unwinnable against a great team, and his whole team said, “We can’t beat this team.” And he went in and they won the game, right? That was a couple of years ago.
Dr. Fauci: (01:06:14)
A few years ago.
Donald Trump: (01:06:15)
The head never changes. The attitude never changes.
John: (01:06:19)
Could I ask Dr. Fauci-
Donald Trump: (01:06:21)
Yes, please.
John: (01:06:21)
Because I know he loves being up behind the podium so much.
Donald Trump: (01:06:23)
He does.
John: (01:06:24)
Like pulling teeth but you don’t have the dentist. I don’t want to hit you with everything that’s coming along, but a lot of people who are watching television today heard from a researcher named Dr. Jacob Glanville who’s come up with a potential antibody therapy that he has given to you, [Samrid 00:12:38]. Just wanting to know if you know anything about this, what you might be able to tell people at home about it if you’ve seen it.
Dr. Fauci: (01:06:46)
You know, John, I don’t know, specifically, this individual what they’re doing, but I can tell you there’s a lot of activity that is centered around a passive transfer of antibodies in the form of convalescent plasma, one. The number is to get immune globulin that you precipitate out of the plasma, and another is monoclonal antibody.
Dr. Fauci: (01:07:05)
It’s based on the same principle of, if you have a protective antibody, passive transfer of that could provide not only protection prophylactically but also treatment. This is an old concept. In fact, immunology was born decades and decades and decades ago with the concept of giving passive transfer of serum to an individual to protect them from an infection. So, I wouldn’t be surprised if he and a number of other people are pursuing this. It’s the right thing to do.
Reporter 8: (01:07:35)
Can I follow up on antibody testing please, Dr. Fauci? At what point can we as a country expect there to be a widespread antibody testing so we know exactly what we’re dealing with here, as well as other questions such as, when can people who are deemed to be healthy donate blood, for example.
Dr. Fauci: (01:07:51)
Okay, so when you talk about antibody testing, there are a couple of things that you want to do. You want to find out if someone has been infected and whether or not they’re going to ultimately wind up being protected. Antibody testing, right now, is not the first thing on our priority. It’s something that we need to do is testing to see if someone is infected. It is very important ultimately to be able to get a feel for what the penetrance of the infection was in society for a number of reasons. You get a better feel of what the impact has been, but also you get a better feel of what the herd immunity would be. So I can foresee in the future that, when we get the facility, which we’ll have for sure… Ultimately, you can get a test that could do this reasonably easy, and do the kind of what we call sero-surveillance study.
Dr. Fauci: (01:08:44)
This is very analogous, that Dr. Birx and I were talking about that a lot, and that is, back in the day when and I were both doing the HIV AIDS issues, back when we first discovered the virus in ’83, and we had an antibody test in 1985. We found out, by serial surveillance representative in different populations, that we were dealing with the tip of the iceberg when we saw individuals who were the ones who actually got infected. It gave us a really good feel for how many people were infected, how many are doing well, and how many are getting ill. I foresee that we’ll have that same sort of information, which will be important information, but right now that’s not our immediate problem. [crosstalk 01:09:28]
Dr. Birx: (01:09:31)
Let me just follow up with that because I think, as I discussed before, we had great… I just want to thank all the epidemiologist and scientists out there who worked with us over the last four weeks on models. Many came forward and really supported us. Right now we’re in talks with a whole series of universities. We have the most brilliant scientist in the world, in our universities in state after state, some of them public health universities, some of them basic science.
Dr. Birx: (01:10:01)
All of them have received NIH grants for HIV or other development of assays in the past. I’ve talked to a lot of them over the last few days to really ask them to develop these simple ELISA tests that could be used rapidly in their health care centers. Because immediately, it’s easy to do. We’ve all developed ELISA’s, so in a day or two, after development, they could screen their entire hospital. I think that would be very reassuring to the healthcare workers who have been on the front line. We worry about them every day. And so I’ve really called on every university and every state to develop ELISAs.
Dr. Birx: (01:10:40)
You can buy the antigens and the controls online and really work to test entire healthcare communities in your states and support them that way. At the same time, we worked on in sub-Saharan Africa on what we call dry blood spots. So we’re looking at, could you use that in a community while we work on the point of care tests, where you just dot blood onto this paper and then can go into the lab and be analyzed. That would allow us to look in nursing homes and other long term care facilities immediately.
Dr. Birx: (01:11:13)
And then finally we’ve reached out to the developers of the rapid test, the ones who developed it for malaria, the ones that developed them for HIV. It’s exactly the same concept and process to ask them to rapidly develop these tests because I think we owe it to the frontline healthcare providers, not only to provide them RNA test, but many of them have been on the front line now for four weeks, may have become exposed. We now know there’s asymptomatic. And, I think, really being able to tell them the peace of mind that would come from knowing you already were infected. You have antibody, you’re safe from reinfection 99.9% of the time.
Dr. Birx: (01:11:52)
And so this I think would be very reassuring to our frontline healthcare workers. And our universities can do that by Friday. So I’m putting that challenge out to them to really work on that and do that. That’s what we did in the early days. We had a ELISA’s up and running within days of having the antigen. And so this is what’s really possible. So we’re not waiting. We’re asking for help now.
Reporter 8: (01:12:17)
So potentially this could happen soon, even within this month- [crosstalk 01:12:18].
Dr. Birx: (01:12:20)
It could happen soon, within this month, if the university help us. Absolutely.
Reporter 9: (01:12:25)
[crosstalk 01:12:25] Mr. President, on Florida, Governor DeSantis says that he spoke with you before sharing his statement-
Donald Trump: (01:12:33)
He did. He spoke to me.
Reporter 9: (01:12:34)
He has some loopholes in that-
Donald Trump: (01:12:37)
That I don’t know. He spoke for me this morning.
Reporter 9: (01:12:38)
For religious events, for example, large religious groups can meet together and that doesn’t really-
Donald Trump: (01:12:44)
Who can?
Reporter 9: (01:12:45)
Religious groups like church can meet.
Donald Trump: (01:12:47)
I didn’t speak to him about it, but he did speak to me this morning. We talked about. Please.
Reporter 9: (01:12:51)
[crosstalk 01:12:51] But your model has full mitigation, sir. Does that go against your model? Because that’s not full mitigation-
Donald Trump: (01:12:54)
I don’t know. It would have to look at what he did.
Reporter 3: (01:12:55)
Back to the healthcare workers on the front lines. Following up with Dr. Birx as well. Hazard pay. You have said you have wanted that for the healthcare workers on the front lines. I know Secretary Mnuchin has mentioned something about that possibly-
Donald Trump: (01:13:08)
I like it.
Reporter 3: (01:13:08)
… In the fourth level of the stimulus package.
Donald Trump: (01:13:09)
I like it.
Reporter 3: (01:13:10)
But can you make it happen now? Do we have to wait for a fourth stimulus?
Donald Trump: (01:13:14)
Well, I think it’s something we’re discussing in terms of bonus or bonus pay. It doesn’t have to be called hazard pay. Could be called… Hey, look, I watched those people going to hospitals that I know. I talked about one of them, right? But I watched them walk into those hospitals, and they walk in, men, women, young, middle age, not so many older ones, and I watch them. They’re almost like… And I think I take the word almost out. They’re like warriors. They’re going in. People are cheering. Where there’s a building across the street, the people are screaming, they’re clapping. They’re like heroes.
Reporter 3: (01:13:50)
[inaudible 01:13:50] going up the Empire State Building-
Donald Trump: (01:13:52)
No, no. I will tell you, I think it’s incredible. They’re like warriors. They like soldiers. And we’re going to be doing something for them, so whether it’s bonus because we’re hopefully going to be over this relatively quickly. It’s going to be vicious for a period of time, but hopefully we’re going to be over this. You have a lot of questions today. Look at you. Do you know this young lady behind you?
John: (01:14:15)
Never met her before in my life.
Reporter 3: (01:14:16)
We practicing social distancing.
Donald Trump: (01:14:17)
That’s good. That’s a good idea.
Reporter 3: (01:14:19)
It makes our marriage strong.
Donald Trump: (01:14:20)
It’s good for a marriage.
John: (01:14:22)
There are a lot of people who are worried about getting sick, and do they end up in a hospital? People who are uninsured and will they be crushed by medical bills. You were considering last month, it’s last month already, in March, reopening the healthcare.gov exchanges. There has been a determination not to do that. Could you tell us what the rationale was behind that decision, and what would you have as an alternative?
Donald Trump: (01:14:43)
Okay. They took that up under the task force and make maybe Mike, do you want to say a few words about it.
Mike Pence: (01:14:49)
Well, thank you, Mr. President. And what I can tell you is that the President has made a priority from the outset of our task force work, make sure every American knows that they can have a coronavirus, and they don’t have to worry about the cost. We were very inspired as well. Because of the President’s engagement with the leading health insurance companies in the country that now, so far, two of the top health insurance companies in America have announced that they’re not only willing to waive copays on testing, now testing is fully covered because of the bill the President signed for every American. But also that these two insurance companies have waived copays on all coronavirus treatment.
Mike Pence: (01:15:35)
And I can assure you that as Congress and the President and the Administration begin to discuss the next piece of legislation, we’re going to make sure that Americans have those costs compensated and covered. Our priority right now is ensuring that every American takes the 30 days to slow the spread to heart. The best thing we can do for one another, for our family’s health, for the most vulnerable among us, is practice those mitigation strategies that the President outline yesterday for the next 30 days.
Mike Pence: (01:16:14)
We’re dealing with testing to make sure that every American can have a test that needs one. We’re dealing with supplies, and we’re making great progress in building personal protective equipment and ensuring that ventilators are available, particularly for the communities most impacted. But the American people can be confident that, as we move into this, we’re going to make sure that our health care workers are properly compensated for their extraordinary and courageous work. And we’ll make sure that the financial burden on those who end up contracting the coronavirus and dealing with its most serious symptoms also can deal with those issues and deal with those cost.
John: (01:16:58)
Understood. Mr. Vice President, but there will be people who don’t have insurance who get sick before any of these mitigation efforts are put into place. And without opening the healthcare exchanges, where can they find insurance? People who aren’t insured by these companies that are covering the cost of the copay, where can people go now to get health insurance if they get before they get sick? Before they get sick?
Mike Pence: (01:17:20)
Well, all across America we have Medicaid for underprivileged Americans, and at the President’s direction, the Center for Medicaid and Medicare services has given unprecedented waivers for states to expand coverage for coronavirus testing and treatment. We’ve also extended waivers for Medicare administration to make sure that people have access to that coverage. But we’re going to continue bring opportunities to the traditional systems of Medicaid in particular for the uninsured in America.
John: (01:17:52)
Can you expand that to cover middle-class?
Mike Pence: (01:17:57)
I think what we’re seeing health insurance companies do today, John, is really inspiring. I mean, one of the things [crosstalk 00:24:02] that has characterized the President’s approach here-
John: (01:18:07)
That’s for people who already have insurance.
Mike Pence: (01:18:09)
Well, one of the things that has animated and characterize the President’s approach is the way he’s engaged American businesses to step up and do their part. And as the President said many times we’re inspired by the spirit of American businesses. I was at a distribution center for Walmart today in Southern Virginia, and I saw the way this company that, literally, has already hired thousands of people… These workers are coming to work. The truck drivers are coming to work, farmers are working in the field. Grocery stores made a commitment to the President a month ago that no grocery store in America would close down. The food supply is strong. We’re getting food on the table of every American, but it’s because the President went to these leaders and said, “We need you to step up and do your part.”
Mike Pence: (01:18:58)
We engaged health insurance executives early on in this process to waive copays on Coronavirus testing, and because of the engagement, and, frankly, because of that patriotic and compassionate spirit that’s being reflected, we’ve already seen two of the largest insurance companies in the country announced that they’re providing full coverage, free of charge for coronavirus treatment.
Mike Pence: (01:19:23)
I fully expect, I think as the President does too, that we’ll see more of that for people that have insurance. We’ll continue to provide flexibility for Medicaid, for people that don’t have insurance. And we’ll make sure that Medicare has a flexibility to meet this moment. For seniors, when we remember that seniors with underlying health conditions are the most vulnerable to serious outcomes from the coronavirus, but we’ll get through this using the full weight of the federal government and the full strength of the American economy.
Donald Trump: (01:19:52)
John, I think it’s a very fair question, though, and it’s something we’re really going to look at because it doesn’t seem fair. If you have it, you have a big advantage and at a certain income level you do. I think it’s one of the greatest answers I’ve ever heard because Mike was able to speak for five minutes and not even touch your question. I said that’s what you call a great professional. Let me just tell you, it’s really a fair question, and it’s something we’re looking at.
John: (01:20:18)
I mean, just in terms of a fair question or not, I always endeavored to ask fair questions, but this is a huge worry for people in this country who were in that donut hole. They don’t have commercial insurance. They don’t qualify for Medicaid. What do they do?
Donald Trump: (01:20:32)
It’s a certain group. And it’s a pretty big group. We’re looking at it.
John: (01:20:35)
We spent the entire 2000 election talking about the donut hole, and it’s still there.
Donald Trump: (01:20:41)
I haven’t been up there yet. The other people have been talking about it, and they haven’t spoken to-
John: (01:20:47)
This was 20 years ago when we’re talking about-
Donald Trump: (01:20:48)
They’re talking about it-
John: (01:20:49)
[crosstalk 01:20:49] the donut hole.
Donald Trump: (01:20:49)
I know, but they’re talking about it in the 2020 election too, and nobody’s gotten to it. Nobody’s talked about it at all.
John: (01:20:57)
Mr. President-
Donald Trump: (01:20:57)
I think we will. Yeah. I think we’re going to get to it. I think we’re going to get to it. I don’t think the other group will get to it. They haven’t even-
Donald Trump: (01:21:03)
I don’t think the other group will get to it. They haven’t even spoken about it and it’s a big group of people.
Female Reporter: (01:21:08)
Are you committing that there’s something [crosstalk 01:21:09].
Donald Trump: (01:21:11)
No, not committing but it’s something we’re going to look at. I can’t commit. I have to get approval from it. I have a thing called Congress, but it’s something we’re going to look at and we have been looking at it.
Female Reporter: (01:21:19)
You mentioned in this congressional bill, the next, the sort of phase four, you would like to see something there [crosstalk 01:21:24].
Donald Trump: (01:21:24)
If there is a phase four, but we’re certainly looking at certain things. We want to help restaurants, entertainment. We want to help because it’s jobs. Not the restaurants, it’s jobs, tremendous amounts of jobs. So we’re looking at that. We’re looking at infrastructure. When you think of it, we will have spent $8 trillion and way back. We’re way pulled back, but we will have spent $8 trillion in the Middle East and yet our roads are in bad shape. Our bridges, our tunnels, bad shape. We’re going to be the talk of the world again soon, but we want two trillion. We will have spent in the Middle East and all we got out of it was death and cost. But all we got out of it was death. Millions of people. You have to look at the other side too. Millions and millions of people killed. Our great soldiers, thousands killed, so many wounded, hurt. Yet when we want to go and fix a road someplace, we want to do what we want to do in our country. It’s time that we spend money on our country. That’s what we’re going to do.
Donald Trump: (01:22:29)
It’s time that we start spending on our roads and our bridges and our schools, and all of the things that we’re supposed to be spending on. People are finally getting used to it. You could look at all of what we’ve done in the Middle East, way back in so many different places, way back in other countries too by the way. I’ve gone to other countries that are very rich. I said, I’m sorry, you’re going to have to reimburse us for our costs. They don’t even want to know what I’m talking about. It takes them 20 minutes to figure it out because nobody’s ever asked them to do that and they’re doing it. They’re doing it and they have no choice. They have to do it. So it’s time that we start spending on the USA. Please.
Male Reporter: (01:23:09)
Mr President, this is a question for the vice president. On March 9th, you said one million tests had been delivered and another four million would be delivered by the end of the week. That clearly did not happen. What happened with those projections? What went wrong?
Mike Pence: (01:23:24)
Well, I think the test kits were delivered according to HHS. But the difference is between receiving a test and the ability to rapidly produce a result of that test. Frankly because of the public private partnership that the president initiated now more than a month ago with our massive commercial laboratories across the country, our team was reported today that we’re now doing more than a hundred thousand tests a day. More than 1.2 million tests have been performed. States have established drive through sites all across the country. In fact, States have been so successful at the community based and drive through testing, that we’re working to transition over completely all of the federal work on drive through testing and have the States completely manage that process.
Male Reporter: (01:24:16)
You’re saying four million tests were delivered by the end of that week?
Mike Pence: (01:24:19)
HHS was very busy from early in the year delivering test kits around the country. But the difference was, as the president said many times, we had an antiquated system where a state laboratory or CDC only had the capacity to process 40 to 60 tests a day. Now with the commercial labs, literally those labs are processing tens of thousands of tests every day. So while we’re continuing to distribute test kits around the country, now because of the partnership with companies like Roche, and Quest and Lab Corp, the American people are seeing the results of those tests more rapidly than at any point in the past. We expect that we’ll continue to expand. But the exciting news this weekend about Abbott Laboratories having a 15 minute test approved is going to put us in a position we believe down the road to get to where Dr [Fowchee 01:25:20] And Dr. [Burks 01:25:21] want us to be for many of the States that don’t yet have significant outbreak. There’s some 19 States where we don’t have significant outbreak, but we want to be doing the kind of surveillance testing in those States that will allow us to early on to identify people with the Coronavirus. Do what the experts call, contact tracing, and ensure that in that state we don’t have an outbreak of the Coronavirus.
Donald Trump: (01:25:47)
Many countries all over the world want to know whether or not they could use, especially our new test that was just developed by Abbott, which is almost instantaneous, which is going to be great. Remember this, we inherited. The word is we inherited bad tests, we literally inherited bad tests. These are horrible tests and it was broken. It was all broken and we fixed it. We’re doing millions of tests. Sometimes we send out a test and it’s not used. In many cases it wasn’t used, but we worked with the States and the testing has been pretty amazing. Especially considering the fact that we inherited a very broken system. Jeff.
Male Reporter: (01:26:26)
Mr. President, just a follow up on something you said before. Are you considering a temporary ban on all domestic flights?
Donald Trump: (01:26:33)
I am looking at hotspots. I am looking where flights are going into hotspots. Some of those flights I didn’t like from the beginning, but closing up every single flight on every single airline, that’s a very, very, very rough decision. But we are thinking about hotspots where you go from spot to spot, both hot. We’ll let you know fairly soon.
Male Reporter: (01:26:59)
What about rail travel?
Donald Trump: (01:27:01)
Similar thing. We have trains going back and forth. People don’t think of trains, but we do a lot of transportation business. It’s a very big decision to do that. We’re pretty late in the process from the standpoint that this is starting. You’re going to start seeing, I think over the next couple of weeks, you’re going to start to see us hit a top and start coming down. So we’ll make those decisions. Those are very, very big decisions from the standpoint of the future of our country in a way, in the future of our country. We have to get our country back. We have to start moving again. We have to start working again. They’re doing tests on airlines, very strong tests for getting on, getting off. They’re doing tests on trains, getting on, getting off. But when you start closing up entire transportation systems and then opening them up, that’s a very tough thing to do.
Female Reporter: (01:27:56)
[crosstalk 01:27:56] There continues to be a lot of public confusion about the use of masks. What is the [crosstalk 01:28:03].
Donald Trump: (01:28:03)
The re use. I love the sterilization of the masks. Ohio Company, you can sterilize the N95. You can sterilize that mask for up to 20 times. Think of that, up to 20 times. We’re throwing them out and they’re very expensive masks. They’re throwing them out. I kept saying, one of the first questions I asked to Dr. Fowchee. I said, why aren’t they sterilized or cleaning the masks? Because it wasn’t my thing exactly when we first heard about this. Nobody else knew it either. Now we have a company and I guess a number of companies, one in Ohio, a great one that makes equipment where you can sterilize a mask up to 20 times, which is fantastic.
Male Reporter: (01:28:47)
What about you or me? What about public? Should we be wearing masks out? We’ve heard lots of different recommendations.
Donald Trump: (01:28:54)
I don’t believe. Look, there’s a big thing. A lot of people don’t like it. Some people don’t like it because you’re taking it away from the medical professional. Some people don’t like it for other reasons. I don’t see where it hurts and it doesn’t have to be a mask. It can be a scarf. Scarf is highly recommended by the professionals. I don’t see where it hurts. I think frankly, if people wanted to do it, we don’t want to do anything that’s going to take masks. You’re talking about a tremendous amount of masks when you do that. We don’t want to take them away from our medical professionals, but I certainly don’t see it hurting. But what I do see people doing now is using scarves. I think in a certain way, depending on the fabric, I think in a certain way the scarf is better. It’s actually better.
Male Reporter: (01:29:40)
Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (01:29:41)
Yeah, please. You [inaudible 01:29:37].
Male Reporter: (01:29:41)
Thank you Mr. President. I wanted to ask you about social distancing and how it applies to religious organizations. Some churches, as you know, have continued to hold services even though you have advised people that they need to practice social distancing. There was a pastor of a mega church in Florida over the weekend who held services that were attended by several hundred people. So my question to you is, should pastors be holding services in the middle of this pandemic? Even if they do, should Americans be going to churches?
Donald Trump: (01:30:07)
My biggest disappointment is that churches can’t meet in a time of need. This is really a great time for churches to be together, for people to get together on a Sunday or any day and meet. Yet, if you do that, if you do it close, you’re really giving this invisible enemy a very big advantage. So it’s the biggest, I think the single biggest disappointment. One of the reasons I said, wouldn’t it be great just to pick a date as I called it aspirational. An aspirational date would be Easter. I will tell you, it’s very, very disappointing. But again, you get too close and if somebody’s sick, you’re going to probably catch it. So you have to be very careful.

A broken economy. Under which conditions would you consider suspending, say, US sanctions.
Donald Trump: (01:32:18)
Look, we have to talk to them. I think we could work out a deal with Iran very quickly. All they have to do is call. I just think that they’re proud people and the leadership is proud. They’re proud like all of us. We’re proud you. You people are proud. They’re having a hard time picking up the phone or they’re having a hard time setting up the meeting, but they could fix their country pretty easily. We don’t want hostility, but if they are hostile to us, they’re going to regret it like they’ve never regretted anything before, as per today’s statement. But all they have to do is call or have somebody call. There are channels where we can deal very easily. Again, I think that John Kerry did a tremendous disservice. I think he violated the Logan Act 100%. that’s what I think. I think it made it tough for them because they were dealing with them for years.
Donald Trump: (01:33:11)
It was a terrible deal. All of that money, $150 billion plus cash, plus cash, plane loads of cash, for a deal that was no good and was short term. Essentially it was a short term deal. Who makes a deal for that kind of money and $1.8 billion in cash? I don’t even know what that would look like. That would be this room would have to be filled up five times with hundred dollar bills. Who makes a deal like this? Then on top of it, the deal is no good. All right. How about one or two more?
Male Reporter: (01:33:43)
Mr. President, Seattle police have reported a surge in calls about domestic violence. A number of groups have raised concern.
Donald Trump: (01:33:50)
Mexican violence?
Male Reporter: (01:33:51)
Domestic violence. A number of groups have raised concerns that the longer people are stuck at home, the more domestic violence cases there are going to be. Do you share those concerns and what is being done to control [crosstalk 01:34:03].
Donald Trump: (01:34:01)
It could be. It’s another cost of not getting our country working. Some people are getting along great. I’ve also had the exact opposite question. Families are coming together. They’re actually coming together. They haven’t talked for a long time and now all of a sudden they’re talking again, they’re loving each other. So I’ve heard that too, but I also have heard domestic violence at a higher level. And drug use because of, in this case, they’d lose their jobs. They had a great job, they had a great life, they have a great family. All of a sudden the husband’s told that he doesn’t have a job anymore and he’s got no money, and that brings drugs into it. That brings suicide into it. It’s a terrible thing. We have to get our country going again. We did the right thing. We had no choice. We did the right thing.
Donald Trump: (01:34:54)
Other countries tried to use the herd or the herd mentality. It’s just something that doesn’t work. Just to say, I heard Sweden gave it a shot and they saw things that were really frightening. They went immediately to shutting down the country. We did the right thing and we did it early. We did it early and we stopped other people from coming into our country early. But no, that’s a cost. I’ve been talking about that. People will say, what are you talking about? But you will have. You’ll have that. You’ll have domestic violence. You’ll have violence. You’ll have suicide. You’ll have drug addiction. A lot of people are going to be lost. We want to get this open as soon as we can. I mean, I’ll be the happiest person. So will you, everyone in this room happy when we get the word that this is the time. We have our common sense and they’ll give me a decision or they’ll be making certain statements. I think I’ll know how to interpret those statements very well. I’ll be with Mike, I’ll be with the task force. I’ll be with a lot of very talented people, including the two people on stage with us. But I look forward, that’ll be a great day. That’ll be a great day. All right. How about one more please?
Female Reporter: (01:36:07)
Can I ask a question of Mr. Wolf? Can I ask a question for Mr. Wolf?
Donald Trump: (01:36:11)
Sure. [inaudible 01:36:13]
Female Reporter: (01:36:16)
What is the current contingency planning [inaudible 01:36:19] detention centers where cases have COVID-19 are already popping up. Some people have been released. Is there a contingency plan? Would you release the most vulnerable people like children and the elder?
Wolf: (01:36:31)
Well ICE looks at on a case by case basis, even well before COVID, on looking at certain detention facilities and determine on a case by case basis if they do need to release individuals. When we do that, we often put them on alternatives to detention as well. In the case of COVID, we’re looking at vulnerable populations. Again, ICE is doing that in conjunction with CDC and other medical professionals. In some cases, we do need to do that for the health and safety, and the wellbeing of those detainees. But again, that’s a case by case basis. We’re not going to make any blanket statement that we’re going to release individuals of whole groups at a time. So it’s really important. I’ve said it twice now, it’s really a case by case basis determining the health of that particular population or detainee, the facility they’re in. Different facilities have different capabilities, whether it’s an ICE owned facility or it’s a contractor owned facility. So we’re certainly doing that. We’re doing that today. We’ve been doing that for the past several weeks.
Male Reporter: (01:37:30)
Could you say how many have been released?
Donald Trump: (01:37:32)
While you’re up, could you talk about how tight that southern border is right now?
Wolf: (01:37:35)
Absolutely. We continue to build miles of the wall every day. We’re up to over 150 I believe. We’re continuing to build new miles of wall. A lot of folks ask about a replacement wall or new miles. It’s a new capability on our Southwest border that we haven’t had before. So whether you talk to the agents, the border patrol agents, they like that capability, they like that impedance and denial that it provides them. It provides the ability for those agents to focus elsewhere on parts of the border that are very difficult to patrol. So we can use our resources in a different way. So we see a lot of benefits from the border wall system. Again, that includes not only the physical infrastructure, but the cameras, the roads, the lighting’s, the fiber optic cables. We’re looking forward and we’re still well on our track, well on our mark to meet 400, 450 miles by the end of the calendar year.
Female Reporter: (01:38:31)
Mr. Wolf, can I get one more question from you while you’re here? There’s been concern among farmers about being able to get enough migrant labor to keep the food supply moving as we go into the harvest season. What are you doing to address that?
Wolf: (01:38:43)
Well, at the direction of the vice president and the task force, we are looking at a number of different options with the H2A workers that you’ve mentioned. On how do we either extend the validity of their visa, or looking at a couple of different options. Nothing to announce here today. But again, at the direction of the president and the vice president, we’re looking at a variety of different options that I think we will have soon and it’d be very beneficial.
Donald Trump: (01:39:06)
But I am glad you asked that question because we want the farmers, they’ve had this for years. We want the farmers to be able to get the people that have been working those farms for years or we’re not going to have farms. So they’re going to come in and they’re going to be given a certain pass. We’re going to check them very, very closely, especially over the next month. Because remember after a month or so, I think once this passes, we’re not going to have to be hopefully worried too much about the virus, but we want them to come in. We’re not closing the border so that we can’t get any of those people to come. They’ve been there for years and years. I’ve given the commitment to the farmers they’re going to continue to come or we’re not going to have any farmers. One more question. Who are you with, by the way?
Female Reporter: (01:39:50)
I’m with Boys of American [inaudible 00:01:39:52].
Donald Trump: (01:39:54)
Boy, amazing. Who else please?
Male Reporter: (01:39:55)
In less than 24 hours sir, two whips will arrive at Port Everglades with people who are infected with Coronavirus.
Donald Trump: (01:39:59)
We’re looking at the two ships. We have Canada notified, a lot of Canadians, a lot of British on the ship. They’re coming to take the people that are on the ship back to their homeland. Canada’s coming, UK is coming, and we have Americans. We have some people that are quite sick and we’re taking care of that. I’m speaking with the governor about that a lot and it’s a tough situation. It’s a tough situation. You can understand you have people that are sick on those ships. States don’t want to take, they have enough problems right now. They don’t want to take them, but we have to from a humane standpoint. We don’t have a choice. It’s like I don’t want to do that, but we have to. People are dying.
Male Reporter: (01:40:47)
So they will be let into the country?
Donald Trump: (01:40:48)
We’re going to do something. We’re going to do something. At a minimum, we’re sending medical teams on board the ships. We’re taking the Canadians off and giving them to Canadian authorities. They’re going to bring them back home. The same thing with the UK, but we have to help the people. They’re in big trouble. No matter where, no matter where they’re from. Happened to be Americans, largely Americans. But whether they were or not, I mean they’re dying. So we have to do something. The governor knows that too.
Male Reporter: (01:41:22)
[crosstalk 01:41:22] before being sent on.
Donald Trump: (01:41:23)
Well we’re sending a lot of them home. We’re sending a lot of them home to their countries, but we’ll be doing something and we’ll be announcing it. You’ll see what we’re doing. But we’re also putting medical staff onto the ships so that we can … we have to take care of the people.
Male Reporter: (01:41:37)
At the risk of you getting chewed out again.
Donald Trump: (01:41:39)
No you won’t actually. You know.
Male Reporter: (01:41:41)
Mr. President, the IRS is requiring people who don’t normally file income tax to file a simple income tax return in order to get their $1,200 check. Is that the way it’s going to be? Or is there something you can do to [crosstalk 01:41:55].
Donald Trump: (01:41:55)
I had heard that. Now, I don’t know. Do you know that answer Mike?
Mike Pence: (01:41:57)
[inaudible 00:20:57].
Female Reporter: (01:41:59)
IRS issued some guidance.
Donald Trump: (01:42:00)
It sounds like it. We could get back. It’s a process that they’re working on. We’ll get back to you as soon as we find out. All right, one more please.
Female Reporter: (01:42:07)
Mr. President, you spoke with President [inaudible 01:42:11] today. [crosstalk 01:42:11]
Donald Trump: (01:42:11)
I did. I spoke to him. He’s great. He’s a great guy and he’s doing a wonderful job from Brazil.
Donald Trump: (01:42:18)
Spoke to him this morning and just a very complimentary call. He’s working very hard. He’s got a problem with the virus, got a big problem. We talked about it today at length. We had a call this morning and Brazil is shut down as you know. They weren’t going to shut it down, but they had to. So Brazil is shut down. The world is shut down. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this. The entire world is shut down. You go from having the most powerful economy in the world and from other countries that are doing well, to being everything is shutdown. It’s very sad, but we’re going to get it going and we’re going to be stronger than ever. I really believe that. We’re going to be stronger. We’re going to have a big bounce, a very big bounce when this is gone. I just want to thank the American people. I want to thank these great professionals and I want to thank the media because really for the most part, the media has been very fair. Thank you very much everybody.
Male Reporter: (01:43:12)
Thank you Mr. President.
Female Reporter: (01:43:12)
Thank you Mr. President."
"Mar 30, 2020",12:06 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Appreciate you being here. Yesterday I announced that we would be extending our social distance guidelines through the end of April. This is based on modeling that show us the peak in fatalities will not arrive for another two weeks. The same modeling also shows that by very vigorously following these guidelines, we could save more than 1 million American lives. Think of that, 1 million American lives. Our future is in our own hands and the choices and sacrifices we make will determine the fate of this virus and really the fate of our victory. We will have a great victory. We have no other choice. Every one of us has a role to play in winning this war. Every citizen, family, and business can make the difference in stopping the virus. This is our shared patriotic duty. Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days and this is a very vital 30 days. We’re sort of putting it all on the line, this 30 days so important because we have to get back.
Donald Trump: (01:10)
But the more we dedicate ourselves today, the more quickly we will emerge on the other side of the crisis. And that’s the time we’re waiting for. The more we commit ourselves now, the sooner we can win the fight and return to our lives and they will be great lives. Maybe better than ever. Today we reached a historic milestone in our war against the coronavirus. Over 1 million Americans have now been tested, more than any other country by far, not even close and tested accurately. And I think what I’d like to do is ask Secretary Azar, who’s done a fantastic job to come up and just say a few words about the fact that we reached substantially now, more than 1 million tests. Please. Thank you Alex.
Secretary Alex Azar: (02:06)
Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership in marshaling all the resources that we have for this unprecedented testing effort. And thank you, Mr. Vice President for leading a whole of economy approach to testing. As the President mentioned today, the United States hit more than 1 million samples tested, a number that no other country has reached. We’re now testing nearly 100,000 samples a day. Also, a level that no other country has reached. I want to thank every partner that has been involved in this effort. That includes all of the men and women of the FDA and the CDC, including Director Redfield and Commissioner Hahn. Together the FDA and CDC have worked to balance the need for testing on an aggressive scale with the scientific rigor that Americans expect. Working with our testing coordinator, Admiral Giroir, they have now truly unleashed the ingenuity of the private sector and our state and local leaders, the centerpieces of America’s historic approach to testing.
Secretary Alex Azar: (03:09)
I want to thank those state and local leaders who’ve used their on the ground resources and knowledge to lead testing and make it much more easily accessible to the Americans who need it. I’m also grateful to FEMA, with whom we are now working closely to get state and local partners what they need. I also want to thank CMS, where Administrator Verma has given healthcare providers unprecedented flexibility to scale up capacity for testing and treatment and has ensured that tests will be paid for. Finally, we would not be where we are today without the many American companies, entrepreneurs and scientists who have worked day and night to develop as of today, 20 different emergency testing options. With the FDA responding to request for authorization, typically within 24 hours the number of options is growing nearly every day. FDA has also opened up new options for using the available tests like self swabbing and new options for re-agents.
Secretary Alex Azar: (04:03)
I also want to thank FDA and other components of HHS for incredibly rapid action on other tools that we need. This weekend we actually worked to secure 30 million tablets from Sandoz and 1 million tablets from Bayer of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, which are potential COVID 19 treatments and we authorized Patel’s new decontamination machines, which can each sterilize thousands of essential N95 masks for reuse every day. So thank you, Mr. President for your leadership and thank you to everybody who’s played a part in getting us where we are today. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (04:38)
Thank you very much. Thank you. I’d like to ask Dr. Hahn come up FTA because we have some really good stuff. First of all, the numbers have been incredible on testing, but in the days ahead we’re going to go even faster and we have something from Abbott Labs which is right here and that’s a five minute test, highly accurate. I maybe can show that as we listen to our FDA commissioner, the job he’s done in the approval process. We talked about the chloroquine and the hydroxychloroquine just now. I thought that I’d mentioned it but Alex has already done that, but we have that now under test with 1,100 people in New York and it was only the fast approval by FDA that allowed us to do that. It was a really rapid approval. And Dr., please say a few words. This is the first one on the line of the five minute test from Abbott.
Dr. Stephen Hahn: (05:42)
Thank you, Mr. President for your leadership. Thank you, Mr. Vice President for your leadership of the task force. I’m very proud of FDA staff’s work in the last few months to expedite the availability of testing in this country. I’m also incredibly appreciative of private industries and willingness to work with us quickly to develop and distribute those tests. We’ve had a substantial addition to testing with the authorization of point of care tests, especially the Abbott point of care tests, which the president has pulled out of the box. A point of care test is a test that gives you a result where you’re getting care.
Dr. Stephen Hahn: (06:18)
This is truly a patient centered approach; whether it’s the doctor’s office, a hospital and emergency room, urgent care center, or a drive by testing site. Just like tests for flu or strep where go to the doctors, you could get the test done, you can get an answer within minutes of having this test done. Now, with those tests being approved for Abbott and for others, these are available around the country. They’re planning to scale up the number of tests that can be put out throughout the country over the next month and patients can get the answer within as little as 15 to five minutes. And then of course, an appropriate plan of treatment can be given.
Dr. Stephen Hahn: (06:57)
We had FDA are working quickly with avid as well on other testing approaches and normally these tests take months to develop. I was on the phone today with the Abbott CEO. He told me that normally this is a 9 to 12 month approach to developing a point of care test. They did this in collaboration with FDA and US government within weeks. Abbott has shared that they will be delivering these tests tomorrow and then we’ll be ramping up. Just have to emphasize one thing, the most innovative and safe products come from the private sector, in partnership with government, taking an all hands on deck approach just like in this case. And the other point here is that Abbott and FDA work together to make sure that we had a fast, reliable and accurate test to market. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (07:41)
Great job. Really great job. Thank you, Steve. So the pharmaceutical company [inaudible 00:00:07:52], has been working with us very closely. And as Alex mentioned, a little bit, 30 million doses of the hydroxychloroquine to the United States government. It’s been given. And Bayer has donated 1 million doses of the chloroquine, which will soon be distributed to states and state health officials around the country. Teva Pharmaceuticals is also donating 6 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to US hospitals. 6 million doses. So the private sector as you’d say, Steve, it’s been amazing what’s happened. Really amazing. And we’re going to introduce you to some of the greatest business executives in the world today, no matter where you go. And they’re going to say a little bit about what they’re doing. And then we have so many more.
Donald Trump: (08:47)
The FDA has also authorized the materials, N95 respirator mask sterilization kits. It’s an incredible thing. I’ve been asking why are we throwing these masks away? You look at some of these masks and they’re significant pieces of equipment that I say, how come you throw them away? Why aren’t they using sterilization techniques? And I got a call from Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio. And he’s a tremendous guy, tremendous governor. And he said, we have a company named [inaudible 00:09:24] and they’re having a hard time getting approval from the FDA. And I called up Dr. Hahn and within a very short period of time, they got the approval. Steve, we really appreciate it. I want to thank Mike and I want to thank Steve. And they’re going to be able, each machine now, can disinfect 120,000 masks per day. Now think of that. Each machine can disinfect 120,000 masks per day. It’ll be just like a new one. It could go up to about 20 times for each mask.
Donald Trump: (09:58)
Each mask can go through this process 20 times. They have two in Ohio, one in New York, and one will soon be shipped to Seattle, Washington, and also to Washington D.C. So that’s going to make a tremendous difference on the masks. This morning I spoke to our nation’s governors to help each state get the medical supplies they need. Yesterday, Vice President Mike Pence asked our nation’s hospitals to begin reporting total bed capacity, ICU bed capacity, ventilator capacity, and vital medical supply levels on a daily basis. And Mike, thank you for the great job. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (10:40)
In New York, the 2,900 bed hospital under construction, which is now completed. They completed it in three days. You might say three and a half days, at the Javits Center, will be completed today. When you look … So they’re going up, I think we’re going to be adding some more beds which will be completed today. We’ve opened up … Whoops, there goes our box and my hair’s blowing around and it’s mine. The one thing you can’t get away with if it’s not yours you got a problem if you’re President. A nearly 3000 medical beds will become operational. The US Navy ship Comfort also arrived today equipped with 12 operating rooms and 1000 hospital beds. Work has begun on additional temporary hospital sites including a 600 bed capacity nursing home facility in Brooklyn and numerous floors of a high rise building on Wall Street. It’s been really a pretty amazing what they’ve done, the Army Corps of Engineers, what they’ve done.
Donald Trump: (11:46)
They just completed, think of it, a 2,900 bed hospital in New York in just about three days, maybe four days. And the whole city’s talking about it. On top of that, we floated in a great ship, which is going to be a thousand rooms, which is being used for patients outside of what we’re focused on and that will free up a lot of rooms for what we’re focused on. So it’s been great. The Army Corps of Engineers is awarded contracts for the construction of alternate care facilities also. At the State University at Stony Brook, State University Old Westbury and the Westchester Community Center, we’re sending 60 ambulances to New York City today. We have a total of 60 we’re getting some additional ones with up to 190 more to follow at different locations.
Donald Trump: (12:46)
To date, FEMA has obligated more than $1.3 billion dollars in federal support to the state of New York. We’re spending a lot of money in New York. It’s a hotbed, there’s no question about it. And we’re spending a lot of time, effort on New York, New Jersey. Spoke with governor Cuomo a lot, spoke with governor Murphy a lot in New Jersey, and we’re really getting the job done. People are very impressed and I’m very impressed by the people in FEMA, the people in the Army Corps of Engineers, because what they’ve done, I’ve never seen anybody doing anything like it.
Donald Trump: (13:26)
In addition to the 8,100 ventilators that we’ve already delivered, over the next 48 hours, we’re delivering more than 1000. 400 ventilators are going to Michigan very shortly. 300 going to New Jersey, 150 ventilators to Illinois, 150 to Louisiana and 50 to Connecticut. FEMA and HHS already delivered 11.6 million N95 respirators, 26 million surgical masks, 5.3 million face shields, 4.4 million surgical gowns and 22 million gloves. And I don’t know if you just saw, it just came over the wires that Ford just announced, just a little while ago, that they will produce along with General Electric Healthcare, 50,000 ventilators, and they’re going to be doing it in less than 100 days.
Donald Trump: (14:24)
And top of that, we have other companies that are doing ventilators, including General Motors, but we have a nine other companies doing ventilators. As we outpace what we need, we’re going to be sending them to Italy, we’re going to be sending them to France. We’re going to be sending them to Spain, where they have tremendous problems and other countries as we can. But the fact that we’re doing so many so quickly is a tribute to our great companies. More than 14,000 National Guard members have been activated and can help supplement state and local…
Donald Trump: (15:03)
… Have been activated and can help supplement state and local efforts to distribute personal protective equipment where we’re sending a lot. We have plane loads coming in. We have 51 loads from various locations all around the world and they’re landing. We had our first big cargo plane land this morning and we’re getting it from all over the world and we’re also sending things that we don’t need to other parts. I just spoke to the Prime Minister of Italy and we have additional capacity. We have additional product that we don’t need. We’re going to be sending approximately a hundred million dollars worth of things, of surgical and medical and hospital things to Italy and Giuseppe was very, very happy. I will tell you that they haven’t a very hard time.
Donald Trump: (15:55)
Joining us this afternoon are CEOs of the great American companies that are fulfilling their patriotic duty by producing or donating medical equipment to help meet our most urgent needs. What they’re doing is incredible and these are great companies. Darius Adamczyk of Honeywell, you know that, and Darius has been somebody that I’ve dealt with in the past and he’s a great leader of a great company.
Donald Trump: (16:23)
Debra Waller of Jockey International. A friend of mine, Mike Lindell of MyPillow. Boy, do you sell those pillows? That’s unbelievable what you do. David Taylor of Procter and Gamble and Greg Hayes of United Technologies Corporation and I just want to tell all of you that America’s very grateful to you and what you’ve done. Amazing job you’ve done and we thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (16:49)
I’d like you to come up and say a couple of words if you might about your companies. Mike, come on up. Come on up fellas. Please come on up. You have to say what you’re doing because it’s been really incredible. Go ahead, Mike.
Mike Lindell: (17:05)
MyPillow is a US vertically integrated company, which has been forced to adjust to the changing business environment as a result of the pandemic. MyPillow is uniquely positioned as a US company that functions as a manufacturer, logistics management distributor and direct to consumer.
Mike Lindell: (17:24)
Given our current business lines, we are experiencing the effects of this pandemic firsthand but MyPillow has done and established internal task force, which is monitoring future needs of companies across the country as a result of this pandemic and given our position, we began to research and develop new protocols to address the current and future needs of US businesses across multiple sectors.
Mike Lindell: (17:48)
How companies are going to prepare themselves when they once again open up and changes to their current operations in order to adjust to future threats and pandemics. MyPillow has designated some of its call center to help US companies navigate the many issues that resulted from this pandemic.
Mike Lindell: (18:04)
We’ve dedicated 75% of my manufacturing to produce cotton face masks. I’m up to time, in three days I was up to 10,000 a day. By Friday, I want to be up to 50,000 a day. I’m proud to manufacture our products in the United States and I’m even more proud to be able to serve our nation in this great time of need.
Mike Lindell: (18:24)
Thank you Mr. President for your call to action which has empowered companies like MyPillow to help our nation win this invisible war. Now, I wrote something off the cuff, if I can read this.
Mike Lindell: (18:36)
God gave us grace on November 8, 2016, to change the course we were on. God had been taken out of our schools and lives. A nation had turned his back on God and I encourage you to use this time at home to get back in the Word, read our Bibles and spend time with our families. Our president gave us so much hope, where just a few short months ago, we had the best economy, the lowest unemployment and wages going up. It was amazing. With our great president, vice president, and this administration and all the great people in this country praying daily, we will get through this and get back to a place that’s stronger and safer than ever.
Donald Trump: (19:19)
Thank you, Mike. Please come on up. I did not know he was going to do that but he’s a friend of mine and I do appreciate it. Thank you, Mike, very much. Please.
Darius Adamczyk: (19:31)
First of all, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, the entire administration and all the agencies, thank you for your strong leadership during this time of crisis. It is noticed and it’s making a difference.
Darius Adamczyk: (19:43)
Second of all, I’d like to say a big thank you to all the healthcare workers out there. You’re putting yourself in harms way every day and we really respect what you’re doing and we couldn’t be thankful enough for it and I can tell you that more helps on the way. We as Honeywell, we’re an industrial technology company and one of the businesses that we’re in, protecting industrial worker. But what we’re doing today is we’re repurposing a lot of that equipment to serve the healthcare worker.
Darius Adamczyk: (20:11)
A few days ago we announced the start-up of a new manufacturing facility in Rhode Island. We’re going to be hiring 500 employees. We have already 200 onboard and we’re going to be starting the production N95 masks within the next two weeks.
Darius Adamczyk: (20:27)
Furthermore, today we’re announcing the start up of another manufacturing facility in Arizona. We’re going to be hiring another 500 people and we’re going to be starting up production in that facility by the middle of May. So in total, we’ve doubled our production of N95 masks already. It’s going to double again within the next 60 days and then within the next 90 days, we’re one of the 5X the capacity we do today. Furthermore, we’re going to be providing other safety equipment to support all the efforts going on. Lastly, I would say a big thing, key to all the Honeywell employees and also announce a $10 million fund for them for all the hourly and administrative employees are having a hard time during this time of crisis. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (21:15)
Fantastic. Thank you. Normally I’d shake his hand but we’re not supposed to do that anymore. So that’s okay. Great job. Thank you to Honeywell. Please, go ahead.
Debra Waller: (21:29)
Thank you Mr. President and Mr. Vice President on your guidance during this unprecedented time and I’m very honored to be here today. Founded by a minister 144 years ago, Jockey International is a family owned company headquartered in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Debra Waller: (21:46)
Since 1876, we have been providing socks and underwear for generations of families. It is part of our DNA to roll up our sleeves and help our country in her time of need. During World War II, we made parachutes for the military and today we are eager to serve this great country by providing support for the healthcare workers on the front lines of this fight.
Debra Waller: (22:09)
As the president and vice president have said, it’s a whole of America approach and we are committed. Jockey has had a long standing partnership with Encompass Group, headquartered in Georgia, serving the healthcare community. When we learned of the critical need for PPE, we knew we had to help. That meant restarting production on tier three isolation gowns.
Debra Waller: (22:33)
Monumental lifting by Jockey, Encompass, FEMA and the FDA was done in just a few days to be production ready. As a result, we expect to begin delivering 30 to 50,000 gowns per week, helping those that need it the most right now.
Debra Waller: (22:51)
In addition, this week we are also donating 10,000 units of scrubs to the frontline doctors and nurses at the Javits Convention Center in New York City. We would not have been able to do this without the collaboration of the administration, representatives from the federal agencies and Congressman Brian Stiles.
Debra Waller: (23:11)
Thank you very much Mr. President and Mr. Vice President.
Donald Trump: (23:14)
Thank you very much.
David Taylor: (23:22)
Thank you Mr. President, Mr. Vice President for bringing us together today. I’m proud to be able to represent the men and women of Proctor and Gamble who every day, 24 hours a day, are working to build and make essential cleaning products, hygiene products and healthcare products for families everywhere. These include healthcare workers and for institutions that are serving those in the front line. P and G people are the faces of the brands you know and trust. Brands like Tide, Pampers, Bounty, Charmin, Mr. Clean and Vicks.
David Taylor: (23:56)
In addition to making, packing and shipping these essential items, they’ve worked together to transform our plants to make things we’ve never made before like hand sanitizers and facial mask. Some of these are already getting to national, state and local agencies. Some of them are in the hospitals already. Everywhere around the world, P and G people are working every day to serve everybody, consumers and they’re working together to bring together the full capability of our research and development, our engineering, our manufacturing and our communications capability to make sure we make a difference to the consumers we serve and to all the audience that we can make a difference to.
David Taylor: (24:40)
I want to thank them and I’m very grateful for what they do every day in service to others. Thank you Mr. President and Mr. Vice President for bringing us together today.
Donald Trump: (24:49)
Thank you.
Greg Hayes: (24:55)
Good afternoon. I’m Greg Hayes from United Technologies and on behalf of the 240,000 employees of United Technologies and the 70,000 employees at Raytheon, which will join together with UTC this Friday, I want to first of all say thank you to the president and the vice president for your leadership during what is really a war.
Greg Hayes: (25:14)
It was a different war than anybody has ever fought before, but it’s a war that we’re uniquely qualified to help. As one of the world’s largest defense contractors and some of the best technology, we’re using that technology to try and solve some real world problems.
Greg Hayes: (25:28)
Today we’re working with the Air Force to try and help the pilots as they’re moving medical evacuees with the COVID-19 virus such that they can be protected and that the patients can be protected.
Greg Hayes: (25:39)
Again, we’re working also with logistics and if you think about a war, strategy is important but logistics wins war. It’s imperative I think with FEMA and along with Mr. Navarro’s office, that we coordinate all of these activities.
Greg Hayes: (25:53)
Last week we donated about 90,000 pieces of personal protective equipment to FEMA. Next week we’ll have another almost million, again working through our supply chain partners around the world. We’re also today, this week, beginning the manufacture of face shields using the additive technologies that we have and the machines that we have available within UTC, we’ll be able to produce approximately 10,000 shields in the next four weeks. Again, all needed equipment.
Greg Hayes: (26:20)
We stand ready to help in any way we can. We don’t need the Defense Production Act to ask us to act. All of the people at UTC and Raytheon are focused on this war and winning it. Again, I also want to say thank you to all of our employees for their work during this crisis, as well as to the frontline medical and other first responders. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (26:40)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Fantastic. Great company.
Donald Trump: (26:43)
Those a great companies. Thank you very much. I’d like to ask Seema to come up and say a few words about what you’re doing and what’s happening and how positive it’s been. I really appreciate it. Come on up, Seema Verma.
Seema Verma: (26:58)
Thank you Mr. President and let me start by saying I want to convey my deepest sympathies to those that have lost loved ones to the Coronavirus. We’re all thinking of you.
Seema Verma: (27:09)
Today’s Doctor’s Day and even without it, I want to send a message of gratitude to the foot soldiers in this war; men and women that are providing care and comfort to Americans that have been affected by the virus. Your country is grateful and in short, as the president has said, we are engaged in a war against an invisible enemy. In war time, the assumptions of peace time must be revisited and adjusted to meet the demands of the moment.
Seema Verma: (27:37)
And so under the president’s leadership, CMS is waving a wide and unprecedented range of regulatory requirements. Now many healthcare systems won’t need these waivers and they shouldn’t use them if they don’t need them but the flexibilities are there. In a time of crisis, regulations shouldn’t stand in the way of patient care and there are several components to our announcement today but the first one is CMS’s hospital’s without walls and this is going to allow hospital systems to create new treatment sites outside of their facility, to expand capacity and be able to safely separate patients that are infected with the Coronavirus and those that are not.
Seema Verma: (28:19)
Now FEMA is doing incredible work setting up temporary hospitals in New York and other areas but under these waivers, we are empowering local communities to compliment and augment the work of FEMA in allowing hospital systems to tap into the capacity that already exist in their communities, making use of dorms and hotels or gymnasiums and allowing the main hospital to focus on those that need the most intensive care.
Seema Verma: (28:46)
There are surgery centers out there today that are delaying elective surgeries and they may have excess capacity that could be devoted to hospital light care.
Seema Verma: (28:57)
We are also making changes to the Medicare program to facilitate testing. So some people that need a coronavirus test can’t leave their home or patients that are in a nursing home and now we will pay for labs to go out to these locations and perform testing.
Seema Verma: (29:12)
We’re also expanding the workforce. We are taking action today to relax some of our regulations to allow hospitals to increase their workforce and we’re allowing a broad range of flexibilities so that we can let healthcare workers operate at the top of their license.
Seema Verma: (29:33)
We are also allowing our hospitals to provide more support for our healthcare workers. Under today’s regulations, they can only provide minimal support to healthcare workers but now we’re going to allow them to provide childcare, meals, laundry services.
Seema Verma: (29:49)
Then there’s also telehealth. The president already directed a dramatic expansion of telehealth to our nation’s 62 million seniors with Medicare and we’re so proud of all the healthcare providers and patients that have rapidly implemented…
Seema Verma: (30:03)
… care, healthcare providers and patients that have rapidly implemented telehealth. But today we’re announcing that we’re going to go even further and we’re going to be paying for doctors to make phone calls with their patients and provide care over the phone. And we’re getting rid of longstanding barriers to telehealth in the Medicare program allowing emergency rooms to use telehealth and eliminating requirements that some visits be provided face to face. And I also want to mention that on Saturday, the president directed CMS to offer advanced payments for healthcare providers that are experiencing cashflow problems.
Seema Verma: (30:35)
We know that many providers are complying with our recommendations to delay non-essential elective surgeries and they shouldn’t be penalized for doing the right thing. Now, I’ve barely scratched the surface of all the flexibilities that we are offering healthcare workers and healthcare systems. These flexibilities will provide a lot of flexibility from regulations that are ill suited to the unprecedented needs of this emergency and doctors and nurses and other healthcare professionals that are working long hours and sacrificing times with their families and risking their lives will have the flexibility that they need to confront the needs of the coronavirus pandemic.
Seema Verma: (31:17)
And there are many heroes in this war, but I want to take an opportunity to thank the team at CMS. These folks have worked day and night. The flexibilities that are in this regulation and any regulation usually take CMS a year. But we did this in two weeks and I couldn’t be more honored and privileged to serve alongside these dedicated public servants. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (31:40)
Thank you very much. You were fantastic [inaudible 00:31:42], and you’re doing a great job. So we are in the midst of something that is very difficult but we are going to win. It’s just a question of when. We want to do it as quickly as possible. We want to have as few deaths as possible and we will meet again tomorrow for some statistics and some updates as to where we are, where we think we’re going, and timing. I think timing is going to be very important because we have to get our country back. We have to get our country back to where it was and maybe beyond where it was because we’ve learned so much, but we will have lost a lot of people and in many ways they hear us.
Donald Trump: (32:26)
And if you look at what’s happening with our medical professionals, it’s a danger there. They’re warriors. Men and women are doing a job the likes of which I don’t think anyone’s ever seen. I see them coming out of planes today going into New York, going into the most dangerous locations, dangerous areas. And they go in there and they just want to do the job. And you see the numbers, you see the numbers, I see the numbers. I have some friends that are unbelievably sick. We thought they were going in for a mild stay and in one case, he’s unconscious in a coma. And you say, how did that happen?
Donald Trump: (33:08)
So I just want to thank all of the great professionals, men and women, doctors and nurses and paramedics and fast responders and law enforcement. By the way, if you look at New York and you see the effect that this had on law enforcement, it’s been incredible. These are great people, firefighters, great people. They’re helping in so many different ways. So thank you very much. And if you’d like, we’ll take a few questions. John, please.
John: (33:34)
Thank you Mr President. Yesterday you said that you would be extending the guidelines through the end of April and that you’ll be giving us specifics tomorrow. Do you expect that the guidelines will just carry on the guidelines that have been in place now for 15 days? Could there potentially be some modification? Also, you have some travel restrictions that come up for reconsideration. The one from the EU on April 13th, Canada, US-Mexico border on April the 21st, well, what will happen with all of that?
Donald Trump: (34:08)
They’ll be staying, and we may add a few more, but the guidelines will be very much as they are, maybe even toughened up a little bit, but they’re having a big impact. They are having a tremendous impact and we’re starting to see it. And that’s the key, we’re starting to see the impact that they’re having.
John: (34:22)
And if I could ask you too, you talked about Ford now ramping up production of ventilators. The government is sending thousands of ventilators across the country. Clearly the supply is increasing, but when you look at the production curve against the hospitalization curve, can you guarantee that everyone who needs a ventilator in the next few weeks will be able to get one?
Donald Trump: (34:44)
Well, I think that some are ramping up to a level that they’re not going to have to, John, and I think that we also have kept in reserve. We have almost 10,000 ventilators in our line. We’ve held back just because we did the stockpile, we didn’t want to give them because we don’t know where the emergency… it hits so fast. It comes so quickly, and we have 10,000. We’re probably going to send some of them now. We’ve been sending a lot to Michigan and various other states. We’ll probably send some additional ones to Michigan. New York’s been doing very well, but we can add some more to New York. We’re adding them to the areas that are having a problem.
Donald Trump: (35:23)
Even Alabama, all of a sudden a flared up a little bit as you saw over the last couple of days and we’ll send them down to Alabama. So we have 10,000, we kept them for this very specific purpose. It sounds like a lot, but it’s not when you think about it, but we’re making a lot and when you see, we’re talking about hundreds of thousands being made in a very short period of time because if you look at what just… so we have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators. And we say go ahead because honestly, other countries really, they’ll never be able to do it. It’s a complex piece of equipment and it’s big and expensive.
John: (36:00)
So do you believe as we approach this peak in a couple of weeks that there will be enough for the American populace?
Donald Trump: (36:05)
Yes. I do think so. I think we’re going to be in very good shape, and we had a great call today with the governors and they were, I actually said, “I hope that the media is listening to this call,” because it was a really good call and that was randomly selected largely Democrats and Republicans in there. I think for the most part they were saying thank you for doing a great job and we discussed that at the end of the call. So really, people are very happy with what we’re doing. Now the circumstances are so terrible because of what’s going on, but I think they’re very impressed by the Federal government.
Donald Trump: (36:45)
I watched that beautiful ship floating in today into, weeks ahead of schedule, almost four weeks ahead of schedule into New York Harbor, Comfort. And I watched the Mercy floating in to Los Angeles a week ago, almost a week ago. And they are stocked. They are really ready to go. They’re stocked with both talent and tremendous amounts of equipment and the Navy and everybody else involved, they got it ready so fast. It’s just incredible what they can do. They’ve geared up. That’s why I mean, I am so impressed by the people involved. Mike and I were talking about it before, the level of genius to put it all together so quickly. A month ago nobody ever heard of this. Nobody had any idea that Mercy was being maintained.
Donald Trump: (37:33)
It was in maintenance for a month. And when they heard we needed it, and I was surprised, they said, “Sir, we’re ready to go.” I said, “What do you mean? You’re not going to be ready for three weeks?” “No sir, we’re all ready to go.” It was incredible. And we’ve had many instances like this. I think the building of the hospital, 2,900 beds in a matter of days, a few days is just incredible. Governor Cuomo was impressed and Gavin Newsome was impressed by what we’ve been doing with Gavin in California in Los Angeles area in particular, but really San Francisco, all over, all over California. When you look at what we’re doing with Michigan, we’re getting along very well with Michigan’s, great place. We’re sending a lot of things to Michigan because that’s becoming a hotbed, especially a specific area as you know, it’s become very hot.
Donald Trump: (38:24)
It’s become, I don’t know, could even at some point supersede, but it’s got to be taken care of. So the relationship we have with the governors, I just wish you could… because we took a lot of calls from a lot of different states and I wish you could have heard, even a thing where the governor of Ohio calls where he has a company that does the sterilization, but they have a problem because it’s not going quickly at the FDA. And I call up Steve and Steve comes and he said, “We’ll get it done.” And they checked it and they got it done almost immediately. And originally they were approving it for 10,000 masks and then it was supposed to be for 80 and they ultimately approved it for 120,000. I mean, it’s a tremendous number.
Donald Trump: (39:10)
And I kept wondering, why aren’t they sterilizing these masks? I assumed maybe you couldn’t do it, but then I’d look at them and they’d look like it’s not cloth. It’s something that looks like it could be sterilized and that’s what they’ve done and that’s the machine that is over there actually. They have a piece of the machine over there. I won’t bother showing it to you. And this is incredible when you talk about five minutes, 15 minutes and highly accurate and not nearly as disturbing to do as the other tests. So we’ve just gotten better. We’re doing things that nobody else ever thought of. Please.
Speaker 2: (39:44)
The DMV has issued today at home orders, but Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia took it pretty far. He issued a 70 day stay at home order. Is that constitutional first off? And secondly, do you think it’s warranted to go ahead and issue a 70 day guidance at this point?
Donald Trump: (40:03)
Well, we’re letting the governors do in their states pretty much what they want with our supervision and they consult with us in all cases. Some go further than others as you know. I mean, I could give you plenty of examples, but I’m not going to do that because we never want to be controversial, but some of the governors have taken it a step further-
Speaker 2: (40:24)
Did he consult [inaudible 00:40:25]?
Donald Trump: (40:26)
… and people are questioning that, but look, staying at home with respect to what we’re talking about doesn’t bother me at all. People should be staying at home. That’s what we want. [inaudible 00:40:35] please. [inaudible 00:40:37].
Speaker 3: (40:38)
2,405 Americans have died from coronavirus in the last 60 days. Meanwhile, you have 2,369 children who are killed by their mothers through elective abortions each day. That’s 16 and a half thousand children killed every week. Two states have suspended elective abortion to make more resources available for coronavirus cases, that’s Texas and Ohio. Do you agree with states who are placing coronavirus victims above elective abortions and should more states be doing the same?
Donald Trump: (41:12)
Well, I think what we’re doing is we’re trying to, as a group, governors and that’s Republicans and Democrats, we’re just working together to solve this problem. What you’re mentioning has been going on for a long time and it’s a sad event, a lot of sad events in this country, but what we’re doing is now we’re working on the virus, we’re working on that hidden enemy and I think we’re doing a great job on, as good a job as you can possibly do. When when Tony and Deborah came up with numbers yesterday to say that if we did nothing, you could lose 2.2, up to 2., maybe beyond, I don’t know, maybe beyond, but 2.2 million people if we did nothing. And I can’t tell you what the unfortunate final toll is going to be, but it’s going to be a very small fraction of that.
Donald Trump: (42:01)
So we’re doing an awfully good job I think with what we’re doing. Please go ahead.
Speaker 3: (42:06)
[crosstalk 00:42:06] in Ohio.
Donald Trump: (42:06)
Please.
Speaker 4: (42:10)
Are you considering all a nationwide stay at home order? I know there’s a lot of states that have put them in place, but some haven’t. I’m just wondering if you were considering some sort of broad stay at home order. And then I have a question for Dr. Birx too, if you don’t mind.
Donald Trump: (42:21)
Well, we’ve talked about it. Obviously there are some parts of the country that are in far deeper trouble than others. There are other parts that frankly are not in trouble at all. So hopefully, we’re going to be able to keep it that way by doing what we’re doing. So we talked about quarantine as you know, the other day a group came to me and they wanted to do the quarantine and I said, “Let’s think about it.” And we did it, we studied it. And by the time the evening came, it just was something that was very unwieldy, very tough to enforce and something we didn’t want to do. But we did advisory. And I think that’s doing well. I mean, I look at the streets, you look at New York where there’s… I looked down Fifth Avenue today, they were showing a shot of Fifth Avenue in Primetime and there was almost nobody on Fifth Avenue.
Donald Trump: (43:09)
I’ve never seen that before. There was no car, there was no anything. So I think the people of this country have done an incredible job. If we do that, we will let you know. But it’s pretty unlikely I would think at this time.
Speaker 4: (43:22)
Can I ask a quick question for Dr. Birx [inaudible 00:43:23]?
Donald Trump: (43:23)
Yes.
Speaker 4: (43:24)
So Dr. Birx, if you don’t mind, you had mentioned today that this model that predicts 100, 000 deaths is if we do things almost perfectly. So I wanted to know, are we currently doing things almost perfectly or are there more things we need to be doing to not exceed that 100,000, 200,000 model.
Donald Trump: (43:46)
Please come.
Dr. Birx: (43:52)
Thank you. Thank you. I think that’s a really great question. And tomorrow we’ll go through all of the graphs and all the information that we took to the president for the decision. But when you… and I just want to thank the data team that’s working day and night to get, I mean, I usually get my data about 2:00 AM from them and they assimilate all the data from all the states. And when you look at all of the states together, all of them are moving in exactly the same curves. And so that’s why we really believe this needs to be federal guidance so that every state understands that it may look like two cases today, that become 20, that become 200, that become 2000. And that’s what we’re trying to prevent. And I think states still have that opportunity, but they’re going to have to do all of these recommended… I mean, these recommendations are recommendations that the globe is using.
Dr. Birx: (44:44)
And so we really do recommend that every governor, every mayor, looks very carefully and ensures that their communities are utilizing these guidance.
Donald Trump: (44:55)
Thank you very much. Thanks. It is amazing. You look at Louisiana and for a long time it was just staying at-
Donald Trump: (45:03)
For a long time, it was just staying at nothing. And then all of a sudden, I look one day and I see a lot and a lot and a lot, and then it explodes. And now, we’re working very carefully and very powerfully with them. We’re building hospitals, we’re building a lot of different things for Louisiana. So, it’s very important. Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 5: (45:24)
Mr. President, Dr. Fauci has warned that this could be seasonal cyclical virus. So… And maybe both of you could comment on this and Dr. Birx as well, are you prepared for this to strike again, say in the fall? All the efforts that are taking place right now to contain this, to be proactive, and you-
Donald Trump: (45:44)
Yeah. We’re prepared, I hope it doesn’t happen. Doctor, would you like to say something about that? I hope it doesn’t happen, but we’re certainly prepared.
Dr. Fauci: (45:53)
In fact, I would anticipate that that would actually happen because of the degree of transmissibility. However, if you come back in the fall, it will be a totally different ballgame of what happened when we first got hit with it, in the beginning of this year. There’ll be several things that will be different. Our ability to go out and be able to test, identify, isolate and contact trace, will be orders of magnitude better than what it was just a couple of months ago. In addition, we have a number of clinical trials that are looking at kind of variety of therapeutic interventions. We hope one or more of them will be available.
Dr. Fauci: (46:29)
And importantly, as I mentioned to you many times at these briefings is that, we have a vaccine that’s on track and multiple other candidates. So I would anticipate that a year to year and a half, we’d be able to do it under an emergency use. If we start seeing an efficacy signal, we may be able to even use a vaccine at the next season. So things are going to be very different. What we’re going through now, is going to be more than just lessons to learn, it’s going to be things that we have available to us that we did not have before.
Donald Trump: (47:02)
Okay. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 11: (47:04)
Mr. President, Scott… Thank you. Scott Gottlieb, your former FDA Commissioner, wrote a roadmap for recovery after the Coronavirus.
Donald Trump: (47:12)
Yeah, very interesting, I saw it.
Speaker 11: (47:13)
He suggests… The roadmap suggests that everybody wear a mask in public. Is that something that the task force thinks is a good idea?
Donald Trump: (47:23)
Well, we haven’t discussed it to that extent, but it’s certainly something we could discuss. We’re getting certainly the number of masks that you need. We are in the process of talking about things… I saw his suggestion on that, so we’ll take a look at it. For a period of time, not forever. I mean, we want our country back. We’re not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time after we get back into gear. People could… I could see something like that happening for a period of time. But I would hope it would be a very limited period of time, doctors. They’ll come back and say, for the rest of our lives we have to wear masks.
Speaker 11: (48:00)
The roadmap also talks about doing GPS for social distancing, maybe following people’s phones, and hotels for isolation for people, giving them free hotel rooms, are those ideas that you’re looking at?
Donald Trump: (48:14)
Well, the GPS, that’s the very severe idea. I’ve been hearing about it, GPS. So, what happens? A siren goes off if you get too close to somebody. That’s pretty severe. But he’s somebody who was with me for a long time. He worked… They did a great job at FDA. So, we’re going to take a look. I just received it a little while ago, he sent it over. So very good. Go ahead. Let’s give it a shot.
Jim Acosta: (48:36)
Sir, what do you say to Americans who are upset with you over the way you downplayed this crisis over the last couple of months?
Donald Trump: (48:44)
Here we go.
Jim Acosta: (48:45)
We have it very much under control in this country. The Coronavirus is very much under control, in the USA. It’s going to disappear. It’s like a miracle. It will disappear. March 4th, we have a very small number of people in this country infected. March 10th, we’re prepared. We’re doing a great job with it. It will go away. Just stay calm, it will go away. What do you say to Americans who believe that you got this wrong?
Donald Trump: (49:08)
[crosstalk 00:00:49:06], it will go away. And I do want them to stay calm. And we are doing a great job. If you look at those individual statements, they’re all true. Stay calm, it will go away. You know it is going away and it will go away, and we’re going to have a great victory. And it’s people like you and CNN that say things like that, that… It’s why people just don’t want to listen to CNN anymore. You could ask a normal question. The statements I made are, I want to keep the country calm, I don’t want panic in the country. I could cause panic much better than even you. I could do much… I would make you look like a minor league player. But you know what? I don’t want to do that. I want to have our country be calm and strong and fight and win. And it will go away.
Donald Trump: (49:50)
And it is incredible the job that all of these people are doing, putting them all together, the job that they’re doing. I am very proud of the job they’re doing, that Mike Pence is doing, that the task force has done, that Honeywell and Procter & Gamble and Mike and all of these people have done. I’m very proud. It’s almost a miracle. And it is, the way it’s all come together. And instead of asking a nasty, snarky question like that, you should ask a real question. And other than that, I’m going to go to somebody else. Please, go ahead. Please.
Jim Acosta: (50:23)
[crosstalk 00:50:14].
Speaker 7: (50:26)
You expressed some concern in the past that medical supplies were going out the back door and that perhaps some hospitals were doing things [crosstalk 00:05:34].
Donald Trump: (50:33)
Well, I expressed what was told to me by a tremendous power in the business. He said that at a New York hospital, for a long period of time, he was giving 10,000, maybe maximum 20,000 masks, over a short time. And all of a sudden, he’s giving 300,000. And I said, “No matter how bad this is, could that be possible?” He said, “No.” So there’s only a couple of that could happen. Is it going out the back door? And I’ve reported it to the city, and let the city take a look at it. But when you go from 10,000 masks to 300,000 masks, Mike, over the same period of time, there’s something going on. Now, I’m not making any charges, but when everyone’s looking for masks… And by the way, that’s another thing, we’re making a lot of masks and the sterilization process is going to save a lot of time and a lot of masks.
Donald Trump: (51:26)
But, when you have the biggest distributor of product that distributes to many of the big hospitals and hospital chains, and he brings up a statistic like that… And I know you’re trying to make a big deal out of it, but you shouldn’t be. You should actually go over to the hospital and find out why. You shouldn’t be asking me. I’m just saying, that’s the way it is.
Speaker 7: (51:47)
Are you-
Donald Trump: (51:47)
You should go over there as a great reporter. I have no idea who you are, but that’s okay. You should go over there. Go to the hospital and find out, how come you used to get 10,000 masks and you had a full hospital? New York City always full. And how come now you have 300,000 masks? Despite the virus and all, you have three… How do you go from 10 to 300,000? And this is very serious stuff. I mean, I could see from 10 to 20 or from 10 to 40 or 50 or something, but how do you go from 10 to 300,000 masks? So what I think you should do as a… I’m sure you’re a wonderful investigative reporter, you should go to the hospital and find out why.
Speaker 7: (52:27)
I’m asking your DOJ to look into it, sir.
Donald Trump: (52:28)
Steve, please.
Steve: (52:29)
[inaudible 00:52:29] challenging [inaudible 00:52:30] look like [crosstalk 00:52:34].
Donald Trump: (52:34)
Well, it’s so bad for the economy. But the economy is number two on my list. First, I want to save a lot of lives. We’re going to get the economy back. I think the economy is going to come back very fast. Steve is just asking about the economy, what’s it like? We basically shut down our country. And we did that in order to keep people separated, keep people apart. They’re not working in offices, they’re not in airplanes together. We’ve really shut it down. And 150/151 other countries are pretty much shut down. But here with the… We have the greatest economy in the world. We have the greatest economy in the history of our country. And I had to go from doing a great job for three years, to shutting it down. But you know what? We’re going to build it up and we’re going to build it up rapidly. And I think in the end, we’ll be stronger for it. We learned a lot.
Donald Trump: (53:26)
And I have to say, we’ve had great relationships with a lot of countries. China sent us some stuff which was terrific. Russia sent us a very large plane load of things, medical equipment, which was very nice. Other countries sent us things that I was very surprised at. Very happily surprised. We learned a lot. We’re learning a lot. And we’re also learning, that the concept of borders is very important, Steve. It’s very important. Having borders is very important. But, we have done an incredible job. The economy is going to come back. My focus is saving lives. That’s the only focus I could have. We’re going to bring the economy back and we’ll bring it back fast. Yeah, please.
Speaker 8: (54:13)
Follow up.
Donald Trump: (54:14)
Go ahead.
Speaker 9: (54:14)
Mr. [Inaudible 00:54:15].
Donald Trump: (54:14)
Please.
Speaker 9: (54:18)
Thank you, Mr. President. You’ve said several times that the United States is ramped up testing, so it’s to talk a little quicker or a little louder. Mr. President, you’ve said several times that the United States is ramped up testing, but the United States is still not testing per capita as many people as other countries like South Korea. Why is that and when do you think that that number will be on par with other countries? And Doctor-
Donald Trump: (54:39)
Yeah. Well, it’s very much on par. Look-
Speaker 9: (54:42)
[inaudible 00:54:42] per capita.
Donald Trump: (54:43)
Per capita. We have areas of country that’s very wide. I know South Korea better than anybody, it’s a very tight… You know how many people are in Seoul? You know how big the city of Seoul is?
Speaker 9: (54:52)
The question-
Donald Trump: (54:53)
38 million people. That’s bigger than anything we have. 38 million people all tightly wound together. We have vast farmlands. We have vast areas where they don’t have much of a problem. In some cases, they have no problem whatsoever. We have done more tests. Well, I didn’t talk about per capita. We have done more tests by far than any country in the world, by far. Our testing is also better than any country in the world. And when you looking at that, as simple as that looks, that’s something that’s a game changer. And every country wants that, every country. So, rather than asking a question like that, you should congratulate the people that have done this testing. Because, we inherited this administration, inherited a broken system, a system that was obsolete, a system that didn’t work. It was okay for a tiny small group of people. But, once you got beyond that, it didn’t work. We have built an incredible system to the fact, where we have now done more tests than any other country in the world. And now the technology is really booming.
Donald Trump: (55:56)
I just spoke to… Well, I spoke to a lot… I’m not going to even mention. I spoke to a number of different testing companies today. And the job that they’ve done and the job that they’re doing, is incredible. But when Abbott comes out and does this so quickly, it’s really unreal. In fact, one company, I have to say, that stands out in the job, and I think I can say this, I don’t want to insult anybody else, but Roche. Roche, is been incredible in the testing job they’ve done. And they’re ramping it up exponentially, it’s up. And you should be saying, congratulations, instead of asking a really snarky question, because I know exactly what you mean by that.
Speaker 9: (56:40)
[inaudible 00:56:40].
Donald Trump: (56:41)
You should be saying, congratulations to the men and women who have done this job, who have inherited a broken testing system and who have made it great. And if you don’t say it, I’ll say it. I want to congratulate all of the people, you have done a fantastic job. And we will see you all tomorrow, thank you very much. Thank you.
Speaker 10: (56:59)
Thank you."
"Mar 26, 2020",6:34 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:15)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Beautiful day. Very good, what you’re doing, look at all those empty seats. Never seen it like that. Oh, boy. Oh, how the world has changed. How the world has changed, right? But it’s going to end up being better than ever. I want to thank you very much for being here and I’d like to update you on the steps we’re taking on our ongoing fight to defeat the virus. This morning at 7:55 AM, I spoke to the leaders of the G20, had a great meeting and we have a lot of different ideas, a lot of good ideas, we’re working together. The leaders gathered virtually around the world to discuss the whole subject of the problem that right now a 151 nations have got. We had President Alberto Fernandez of Argentina, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, President Xi of China, President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, Prime Minister Modi of India, President Widodo of Indonesia, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.
Donald Trump: (01:52)
Congratulations to Japan, on making a great decision on the Olympics, going to make it next year, 2021. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico. I want to thank the President of Mexico for having done such a great job with respect to the military. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border and very few people are getting through, I can tell you that. We got to keep it that way. And we have a great relationship with Mexico now. President Putin of Russia, King Salman of Saudi Arabia, President Ramaphosa of South Africa, President Moon of, as you know, a country that we spend a lot of time in, South Korea. We’re working very hard on that. Prime Minister Sanchez of Spain, President Erdogan of Turkey, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Council Charles Michel, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, World Health Organization Director Tedros Adhanom, World Bank President David Malpass, and the International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
Donald Trump: (03:35)
So that’s a big group, but it’s a great group, and they were all there, every one of them. And we talked about the problem and hopefully it won’t be a problem for too much longer. The United States is working with our friends and partners around the world to stop the spread of the virus and coordinate our efforts. We discussed how vitally important it is for all of our nations to immediately share information and data. And we’ve been doing that to a large extent, but we’ll do it even more so, and to inform our, I guess you could say inform each of us on the fight that we’ve got going one way or the other, it’s a little bit different, but we’re handling it a little bit in different ways. But there is great uniformity I think, we had a… it was a terrific meeting, tremendous spirit among all of those countries. You had 20 countries plus the other people that I mentioned, and a tremendous spirit to get this over with.
Donald Trump: (04:33)
After the meeting with the world leaders, I spoke with the governors of our 50 states and territories. Our team as a been in constant communication with the governors and we had a terrific meeting. Somebody in the fake news said that one of the governors said, “Oh, we need Tom Brady.” I said, “Yeah, he meant that in a positive way.” He said, “We need Tom Brady.” We’re going to do great and he meant it very positively, but they took it differently. They think Tom Brady should be leading the effort. That’s only fake news, and I like Tom Brady, spoke to him the other day. He’s a great guy. But I wish the news could be real, I wish it could be honest, I wish it weren’t corrupt, but so much of it is. It’s so sad to see. Just so sad to see. We had a great meeting. I’ll tell you what, I’m sure you have tapes of the meeting. I’m sure that you were able to get tapes, very easily see it 50 governors plus.
Donald Trump: (05:34)
And if you had tapes you’d see it was really, I mean, there was no contention, I would say virtually none. I would say maybe one person that was a little tiny bit of a raising of a voice, a little wise guy a little bit, but he’s usually a big wise guy, not so much anymore. We saw to it that he wouldn’t be so much anymore, but he is… we had a… I mean I would rate, Mike was there, a lot of the folks in the back were there, and it was a great meeting. Took place at about 12 o’clock. So we went from the G20 to the governors, we also spoke about the economic relief with the governors and the package that we’re moving through Congress to deliver much needed financial assistance to hardworking families and small businesses. I want to thank the Democrats and Republicans in the Senate for unanimously passing the largest financial relief package in American history, 96 to zero, and I have to say it’s the largest by far. And I’m profoundly grateful that both parties came together to provide relief for American workers and families in this hour of need.
Donald Trump: (06:48)
The House of Representatives must now pass this bill, hopefully without delay. I think it’s got tremendous support when you’re at 96 to nothing. And, as you know, a couple of those people are quarantined and one, Ryan Paul, he’s actually got it, but he’ll be better. He’s been a great guy. He’s been a great friend of mine actually. The massive $2.2 trillion relief package includes job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that keep their workers on the payroll, it’s pretty good. Loan forgiveness, keep the workers on the payroll, it’s pretty good. Direct cash payments will be available to American citizens earning less than $99,000 per year. $3,400 for the typical family of four. Expanded unemployment benefits, the average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100% of their salary for up to four full months.
Donald Trump: (07:50)
These are things that, by the way, we have plenty more to go and, but there are things that nobody’s ever had any package like this done, and I just want to thank them. Hopefully it’ll get approved equally easily in the House. Really, I think it will go through pretty well from what I hear. Virtually everybody, there could be one vote, one vote, one grand stander maybe, you might have one grand stander. And for that we’ll have to come back and take a little more time, and it’ll pass, it’ll just take a little longer. But let’s see whether or not we have a grand stander. Critical support for the hardest hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks and tough new safeguards to prevent executive compensation abuse. Over $100 billion for our amazing doctors, nurses and hospitals, $45 billion for the disaster relief fund, more than doubling the amount available, this is tremendous stuff. $27 billion for the coronavirus response, including $16 billion to build up the strategic national stockpile, with critical supplies, including masks, respirators, and all sorts of pharmaceuticals.
Donald Trump: (09:07)
$3.5 billion to expand assistance to childcare providers and childcare, the benefits to healthcare workers, first responders and others on the front lines of the crisis, and these are really brave, incredible people I have to say. And some of them are getting sick, and some of them are getting very sick, and some of them don’t even recover. They’re incredible people. $1 billion for Defense Production Act procurement. We are, as you know, using the act, but we use it only when necessary. We use it as leverage, we generally don’t have to use it to accomplish what we want to accomplish. As of today, FEMA has shipped over 9 million n95 masks, 20 million face masks, 3.1 million face shields, nearly 6,000 ventilators, 2.6 million gowns, 14.6 million gloves, and we’re sending more every day and we’ve got tremendous amounts of equipment coming in. A lot of great companies are making equipment right now. The ventilators, obviously they take a little longer to make, but we have a lot of companies making them and we’re going to be in great shape.
Donald Trump: (10:20)
We took over an empty shelf. We took over a very depleted place in a lot of ways. As you know, the testing is going very, very well, and that was obsolete and broken and we fixed it, and it’s been going really good. And I think very importantly, the stockpile, we’re really filling it up and we fill it up rapidly. But we get it out, sometimes we have it sent directly to the states instead. And again, the state has to be doing this kind of a thing also. We’re sort of a… we look from behind a little bit and we look at how are they doing and if they need help, we do it, but it’s their first responsibility. Sometimes they just can’t get it, but we load it up and we send it out, but if we can, we have it sent directly to the state. We want it to go directly to the point where we want it.
Donald Trump: (11:12)
I can now announce something that I think is incredible, what they’ve done in the Navy, because the incredible Naval hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, which is incredible actually when you see it inside, will be underway to New York city on Saturday. So it’s going to be leaving on Saturday rather than three weeks from now. They did the maintenance quickly and it was going to be there for quite a while longer, another three or four weeks, and it should be arriving. I told the governor 20 minutes ago, Governor Cuomo, that the ship will be arriving at New York Harbor on Monday. I think I’m going to go out and I’ll kiss it goodbye. I’ll go to, it’s in Virginia as you know, and I will go and we’ll be waving together, because I suspect the media will be following. Johnny, you going to be following? Maybe, you never know, huh?
Johnny: (12:14)
I have concerns, a very important vessel.
Donald Trump: (12:14)
It’s a great chip. It’s a great vessel, that’s right. So if you want to go, I’ll see you there, and if you don’t, that’s okay. After being fully loaded with medical supplies, it’s going to be, it’s loaded up to the top and it’s over at the Norfolk Naval Base, that’s where it departs. It is expected then to, I mean we’re saving about three to four weeks by the incredible work done by the Navy, and I actually look forward to Saturday to see it go. The ship will arrive and I believe it’s going to get a little bit of a ceremony. There’s something very beautiful about it. It’s an incredible piece of work. Going to be landing at Pier 90 in Manhattan to provide hospital surge capacity for the New York metropolitan area, so it’s a surge capacity. They may use it for this or they may have other people coming in from hospitals unrelated to the virus and then they’ll use those hospitals on land, they’ll use those hospital for the virus, but we’ll see how they do it. They could do it either way, one way or the other, whichever one is best.
Donald Trump: (13:22)
But it could be, because it’s set up so well for a regular hospital, that they may take people out of hospitals and then use those rooms for the virus. The National Institute of Health and the private sector, working closely with the FDA, continue to collaborate to discover and test treatments and therapies that can effectively reduce the duration and symptoms of the virus and help, very much help, people to recover. And I’m firmly committed to bringing these treatments to market very quickly. We have a lot of tests going on with regard to different medicines, and I hope we get lucky. I hope we hit… a lot of talented scientists and doctors are working on therapeutics, a cure, vaccines. I think we’re doing very well. Tony may speak to that a little bit later, but I think we’re doing very well with regard to the vaccines. I think we’re doing well with regard to a lot of the things I just mentioned, but we’ll have to see what happens. We’re going to know fairly soon about a lot of them.
Donald Trump: (14:27)
But it’s very advanced and the vaccines are very advanced prior to, as you know, a fairly reasonably long test period of, in that case, over a year. Every American should be proud of the incredible spirit our country has brought to this effort. It’s been incredible. Citizens from all walks of life have come together to turn the tide in this battle. We’re witnessing the extraordinary of American unity like a lot of people have never seen, even getting a vote. You’re talking about trillions of dollars and you get to a vote of 96 to nothing. We are waging war on this virus using every financial, scientific, medical, pharmaceutical and military resource to halt it’s spread and protect our citizens. I want to express our tremendous thanks to the American people for continuing to practice social distancing like you people are practicing right here. I don’t know, this room may never be the same. Maintaining good hygiene and follow government guidelines. Vice President Pence lifts up that card every time, and it’s not very complicated, but hopefully you can do that. And your commitment will make all the difference in the world, and that’s one of the big ones will be for awhile, stay home. Just relax, stay home. Making a lot of progress as we continue to gather more information and accelerate the testing where we’re doing record numbers of tests now, far more than any other country has done. I told you yesterday, eight days here, because you heard so much about South Korea, the media kept of themself, South Korea, South Korea, we have a great relationship with president Moon and South Korea. But when I hear so much about South Korea, so in eight days we do more testing than they did in eight weeks, and it’s a very highly sophisticated test. We’ll be able to deploy even more data-driven and targeted approaches to slow the… ultimately it’s a very devastating thing, but we will vanquish this virus, and a lot of progress has been made.
Donald Trump: (16:44)
That’s why earlier today I sent a letter to Americas governors describing how we will be using the data to update existing guidance on social distancing, which will be developed in close coordination with our nation’s public health officials and scientists. Because of the sacrifices of our great doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals, the brilliance of our scientists and researchers, and the goodness and generosity of our people, I know that we will achieve victory and quickly return to the path of exceptional health, safety and prosperity for all of our citizens.
Donald Trump: (17:20)
We have to get back to work. Our people want to work, they want to go back. They have to go back and we’re going to be talking about dates, we’re going to be talking with a lot of great professionals. But this is a country that was built on getting it done and our people want to go back to work. I’m hearing it loud and clear from everybody, so we’ll see what happens. We’re going to have a lot more information early next week and we’ll be reporting that back, but I just want to leave it with you, we have to go back. This is the United States of America, they don’t want to sit around and wait and there’ll be practicing. And by the way, a lot of people-
Donald Trump: (18:03)
And then wait and there’ll be practicing. And by the way, a lot of people misinterpret when I say go back. They’re going to be practicing, as much as you can, social distancing and washing your hands and not shaking hands, and all of the things that we talk about so much. But they have to go back to work. Our country has to go back. Our country is based on that. And I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly. I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly. A lot of progress is made, but we got to go back to work.
Donald Trump: (18:32)
We may take sections of our country, we may take large sections of our country that aren’t so seriously affected and we may do it that way, but we’ve got to start the process pretty soon. So we’ll be talking to you a little bit more about that next week. And with that, if you have any questions you could ask. And then I’m going to have vice president stay behind and he’s going to take questions and also introduce some of the people. You can ask them some questions. John, please.
John: (19:02)
Mr. President, unemployment numbers out today, 3.3 million. I take it, not a surprise?
Donald Trump: (19:07)
No, not at all.
John: (19:11)
But still a staggering number. I wonder about your perspective on that.
Donald Trump: (19:14)
Well, it’s a nobody’s fault, certainly not in this country. Nobody’s fault. We got very lucky when we made a decision not to allow people in from China at a very early date. I say that because some people don’t want to accept it, but this was a great decision made by our country. Or the numbers that you’re talking about, we’re a big country, they’d be far greater, far, far bigger.
Donald Trump: (19:41)
So when I heard the number, I mean, I heard it could be six million, could be seven million. It’s 3.3 or 3.2, but it’s a lot of jobs. But I think we’ll come back very strong. The sooner we get back to work, every day that we stay out, it gets harder to bring it back very quickly. And our people don’t want to stay out. So I know those numbers, John, but I think you’ll see a very fast turnaround once we have a victory over the hidden enemy, as I say, it’s a hidden enemy. Sometimes a hidden enemy is a lot tougher than somebody that stares you in the face, right? So we’ll see what happens. But, I mean, they’re fully expected numbers, at least. I mean, at least. Steve, please.
Steve: (20:22)
The U.S. proposal to deploy some troops along the Canadian border, Prime Minister Trudeau is complaining about that. Why is that necessary?
Donald Trump: (20:31)
Well, we have very strong deployments on the Southern border, as you know, with Mexico. And we had some troops up in Canada, but I’ll find out about that. I guess it’s equal justice to a certain extent. But in Canada, we do have troops along the border. We have a lot of things coming in from Canada. We have trade, some illegal trade that we don’t like. We have very strong sanctions on some, we have very strong tariffs on dumping steel.
Donald Trump: (21:04)
And we don’t like steel coming through our border that’s been dumped in Canada so they could avoid the tariff. I charge a lot of tariff for the steel, and it’s been great for our steel companies because now they can really go. You look at what’s happened with steel, it’s been pretty incredible. But we’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs on steel, and much of it comes in from China, but they can come through the Canadian border too, so we’re always watching for that.
Steve: (21:28)
If I’m reading the numbers correctly, the United States now has surpassed China as the country with the highest number of virus cases. Does this surprise you at all? Is it following a predictable trajectory?
Donald Trump: (21:41)
No, I think it’s a tribute to our testing. Number one, you don’t know what the numbers are in China. China tells you numbers and … I’m speaking to President Xi tonight. I believe that we’ll have a good conversation, I’m sure. But you just don’t know. What are the numbers?
Donald Trump: (21:57)
But I think it’s a tribute to the testing. We’re testing tremendous numbers of people and every day, the way the system works, and I want to thank especially, Roche has been fantastic, a great company. They’ve done a tremendous amount … Deborah was telling me before that they were really, they’ve really stepped up to the plate and done great, as have other of the companies. But it seems that they’re really doing it particularly well. So we’ll see what happens there. But it’s a tribute to the amount of testing that we’re doing. We’re doing tremendous testing. And I’m sure you’re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing, and I think that’s a little hard.
Speaker 1: (22:33)
Mr. President, on the 3.3 jobless claims, you just suggested it could be six to seven million. A lot of those workers-
Donald Trump: (22:40)
No, I didn’t say that. No, you’re wrong. I didn’t say that. I said some people were projecting that it would be six or seven and it’s, I believe, 3.3.
Speaker 1: (22:48)
It came it at 3.3. Millions of Americans out of work, some of them will be losing their insurance. What’s your plan to make sure, through no fault of your own, as you just mentioned, that they stay insured? Are you willing to plus up the subsidies for some of the exchanges under Obamacare, expand Medicaid? What’s being considered?
Donald Trump: (23:05)
I mean, the things I just read to you are being considered and other things are being considered. People are going to be getting big checks and it’s not their fault. What happened to them is not their fault.
Speaker 1: (23:16)
But for their health-
Donald Trump: (23:16)
So we’re doing a lot of different things on health insurance. We have meetings on it today. We’re taking care of our people. This is not their fault what happened, and we’re taking care of … We’re starting off by sending them very big checks. I think for a family of four, it’s about $3,000. And we’re taking care of our people, we’re taking care of our workers. As I say, this was not a financial crisis. This was a health crisis, a medical crisis. We’re going to take care of our people. Please. Yeah.
Speaker 2: (23:44)
The National Restaurant Association came out with the survey this morning saying that 3% of all restaurants in this country have shuttered for good in the past three weeks. And the projection is that 11% more are going to close in the next 30 days. So what do you say to a restaurant owner who is looking at his sheets and thinks he has to close within the next 30 days?
Donald Trump: (24:15)
Well, I hate to … I know the business very well. I understand the restaurant business is a very delicate business. It’s a business that is not easy. I always say, in a restaurant business, you can serve 30 great meals to a person or a family and they love it. One bad meal, number 31, they never come back again. It’s a very tough business, but they’re great people that run restaurants.
Donald Trump: (24:39)
And I’ve heard 3% could be lost and you could go as high as 10 or 11%, but they’ll all come back in one form or another. It might be a different restaurant, but it’s going to be a great business for a lot of people. And we’re making it easy for people to … Look, what we’re doing in terms of loans, what we’re doing in terms of salaries, they’ll all come back. It may not be the same restaurant, may not be the same ownership, but they’ll all be back. Yes, sir. Please.
Speaker 3: (25:05)
Mr. President, you mentioned the pledges from American companies to provide supplies, but as we top 81,000 cases in the U.S., does it make sense to re-look at using the Defense Production Act?
Donald Trump: (25:19)
Well, I talked about the Defense Production Act a lot and I’ve enacted it. I have it. I can do it with a pen. And we have actually used it on two minor occasions, and then we could withdraw it. But for the most part, the companies, we don’t need it. We say we need this and they say, don’t bother, we’re going to do it.
Donald Trump: (25:39)
I mean, we’re dealing with Ford, General Motors, 3M. We’re dealing with great companies. They want to do this, they want to do this. They’re doing things that, frankly, they don’t need somebody to walk over there with a hammer and say, do it. They are getting it done. They’re making tremendous amounts of equipment, tremendous amounts. And when this is over, we’re going to be fully stockpiled, which they would have never been except for a circumstance.
Donald Trump: (26:05)
This was something that nobody has ever thought could happen to this country. I’m not even blaming … Look, we inherited a broken situation, but I don’t totally blame the people that were before me and this administration. Nobody would’ve ever thought a thing like this could have happened. But the production act, Defense Production Act is a wonderful thing, but I just haven’t had to use it. They know it’s activated. They know I can use it. Maybe that frightens them a little bit. It’s got tremendous power, but I haven’t had to. Please.
Speaker 4: (26:35)
Thank you, sir. A question for me and then another question, if you’ll let me, for some of my colleagues who are social distancing.
Donald Trump: (26:43)
Where are they? They were all outside trying to get in. I know.
Speaker 4: (26:46)
The first question has to do with a cruise liners like Carnival and Royal Caribbean. They want this relief aid, but they’re worried because they offshored to places like Panama and Liberia, they might not qualify. Senator Holley has said that they should move back to the United States before they get a check. Do you agree? Should they pay U.S. taxes to get U.S. taxpayer relief?
Donald Trump: (27:10)
So I’m a big fan of Senator Holley and I also like the idea. There were some senators that didn’t want to do anything like Carnival, great company, but they’re based in different places. I won’t tell you why. I could tell you exactly where they’re based, but I won’t do that. But they’re based in actually more than one places, as ships are registered in different locations.
Donald Trump: (27:33)
I do like the concept of perhaps coming in and registering here, coming into the United States. It’s very tough to make a loan to a company when they’re based in a different country, but with that being said, they have thousands and thousands of people that work there, and maybe almost as importantly, that work on shore filling these ships with goods and products. And the cruise line business is very important. And I know Carnival, what a great job they do, Micky Arison. And I would think that we could stick with Senator Holley and maybe really look at that very seriously.
Donald Trump: (28:11)
Look, it’s a big business, it’s a great business. It’s a business that employs tremendous number of people outside of the ship itself. I mean, you look at these ports, it’s loaded up with shops and people that are involved with the ship. So we’re going to work very hard on the cruise line business and we’re going to try and work something out, but I like the concept. Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 4: (28:32)
The second one. Thank you, sir. The Senate bill includes aid that’s directly tied to the airlines and since before the pandemic, Boeing was already suffering from the losses of 737 MAX airplanes. Do you think it’s appropriate to use this legislation to provide them with $17 billion of aid on top of 25 billion that they could qualify for as a passenger airline, and then another four billion that they could qualify for as a cargo airline? Is that fair?
Donald Trump: (29:05)
So the airline business is a very tough business, over many years. It’s been very, very tough. It’s got everything. It’s got labor, it’s got very strong, powerful … You look at the cost of these airliners. Everything is tough. Very highly technological, you look at how complicated, how complex. It’s got unions, it’s got everything. The airline business, generally speaking, it’s a very tough business, always been a very tough business.
Donald Trump: (29:32)
With that being said, we have to keep our airlines going. And we’re going to be using some … Now maybe we’ll take a piece of the airlines for the country, for our country, where we loan money and we take a piece. It’s all fully ready, we’re ready to go. But if we didn’t do that, we’d end up with no airlines and we can’t do that. The airline business is very vital to our country. It’s a tough business. We have to understand that. I mean, I could tell you other businesses that are different kinds of business, they are very good businesses, but airlines have always been very, very tough. Please. No, please. Yeah, I didn’t call you, I called this gentleman.
Speaker 5: (30:09)
Thank you. Thanks a lot. On Monday-
Donald Trump: (30:11)
Who are you with?
Speaker 5: (30:12)
Did you speak with-
Donald Trump: (30:12)
Who are you with?
Speaker 5: (30:13)
I’m with Bloomberg.
Donald Trump: (30:14)
Yeah, Bloomberg.
Speaker 5: (30:15)
Mario Partners.
Donald Trump: (30:16)
How’s Michael? Doing good?
Speaker 5: (30:19)
Mr. President, on Monday, did you speak with Chinese President Xi before you urged Americans to not blame Asian Americans for the coronavirus? We noticed that you’ve backed off of that language. I know you’re speaking with him again tonight.
Donald Trump: (30:35)
No, I didn’t. I’m speaking to him tonight. It’s scheduled to go tonight. I’ll have a call with President Xi of China. A very good relationship. No, I didn’t like when they came up, and it wasn’t him. Somebody at a lower level, mid level, we found out pretty much. But they made a statement that our soldiers brought it into China. No, it came from China.
Donald Trump: (30:57)
And we just signed a very big deal with China. They’re paying us a lot of money in tariffs and other things. They never paid us 25 cents. Look, China has taken advantage of the United States, until I came here, with sleepy Joe Biden and Obama and Bush and everybody else. I’m not blaming them, I’m blaming everybody. They were allowed to, $500 billion a year they were taking out. We had trade deficits that were so large, nobody’s ever seen anything like it, and we’ve changed it.
Donald Trump: (31:30)
Look, now we’re taking in billions of dollars and we gave some to our farmers, because China, they targeted our farmers. And our farmers are very happy and our farmers got through a very rough period because of what I was able to do. Took the money from China and gave it to the farmers and we had plenty of leftover after that. Now we’re going into a phase two negotiation with China, but we’re getting 25% on $250 billion, and then we’re getting a lot on money after that.
Donald Trump: (31:59)
So we’ve never had to deal with China. China took advantage of the United States. And you know what? I don’t blame China for that. I blame the people that were right here, because they should have never allowed it to happen. But the relationship with China has been a very good one. John?
Speaker 5: (32:15)
Mr. President, did President Xi ask you to calm that language down or to not use that language?
Donald Trump: (32:20)
He never asked me to calm it down, no. Somebody might’ve spoken to somebody, but nobody spoke to me about it. I think it was time though, because I talk about the Chinese virus, and I mean it. That’s where it came from. If you look at Ebola, if you look at all … lyme, right? Lyme, Connecticut. You look at all these different horrible diseases, they seem to come with the name, with the location. And this was the Chinese virus. But I don’t have to say it if they feel so strongly about it. We’ll see.
Donald Trump: (32:53)
But we just made a great deal with China. Great, hopefully, for both parties. But we’ve made a deal with China and we’re going to do another one it looks like. They want to do it very badly. Maybe they’ll want to wait, like Iran. They want to wait to see whether or not Trump gets beaten in the election, because would they love to negotiate with Biden or somebody else other than me. They would love it. That’s their best dream in the world. So many others. So there are some that maybe are waiting until after November 3rd, the election day.
Donald Trump: (33:23)
But I think we’re doing very well. It would be sad if we blew all of the advantages that we have right now, because we’ve made unbelievable trade deals. Whether it’s Mexico, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, and others, we have changed the whole thing around. Please.
John: (33:41)
Mr. President, earlier today you sent a notification letter to the nation’s governors saying that you will soon come out with new guidelines about social distancing and other items. Do you have any data yet to suggest which specific areas of the country may have their guidelines relaxed, which areas of the country may have their guidelines tightened?
Donald Trump: (34:00)
I think Deborah will talk to you about that, and Tony in a few minutes. But I think we’ll start talking about that, because we have to open up. We can’t say, let’s close. People don’t want to close, John. I say it again and again. The reason I do, because I want you to report it eventually. Go ahead, Steve.
Speaker 6: (34:15)
How would that work without widespread testing done to-
Donald Trump: (34:16)
Go ahead, Steve.
Steve: (34:19)
From President Xi tonight, what do you want to talk to him about?
Donald Trump: (34:22)
Yeah, it’s his call. I mean, I’ll talk to him, whatever he wants to … We’ll have, I think, a very fruitful call, have a good call tonight at nine o’clock. Please.
Steve: (34:32)
Is it about the virus [inaudible 00:34:34]?
Donald Trump: (34:33)
We’ll be talking about that. Yeah, we’ll be talking about the virus. In the back first, please.
Speaker 7: (34:40)
Thank you, Mr. President. Despite the jobless claim numbers today, the market rallied again. It’s up over 4,000 points the last three days.
Donald Trump: (34:46)
Yeah, record.
Speaker 7: (34:48)
The largest charge since 1931. Do you think that the economic uncertainty has passed, in the market?
Donald Trump: (34:55)
No, not yet. It hasn’t passed, but it’s come a long way. I think they think we’re doing a really good job in terms of running this whole situation having to do with the virus. I think they feel the administration, myself and the administration, are doing a good job of keeping very important people informed. Because it was a great fear and a lot of good things are happening.
Donald Trump: (35:22)
The mortality rate is at a, in my opinion, you’ll have to speak to Deborah, Tony, all of the others, but in my opinion, it’s way, way down and that takes a lot of fear out. It’s one thing to have it, it’s another thing to die. When I first got involved, I was being told numbers that were much, much higher than the number that seems to be. And remember that people that have it … many people have it. I just spoke to two people, they had it. They never went to a doctor. They had it, absolutely had it, but they never went to a doctor. They never went to any of that. They didn’t report it. You have thousands and hundreds of thousands of cases like that, so you have to add that to the-
Donald Trump: (36:03)
… hundreds of thousands of cases like that, so you have to add that to the case load also. And the people that actually die, that percentage is a much lower percentage than I ever thought. That’s one of the reasons I say, look, we’re going to beat this and we’re going to get back to work.
Speaker 8: (36:16)
I have one more question-
Donald Trump: (36:17)
Yes, please.
Speaker 8: (36:18)
… on more news from the administration today, the DOJ announced charges against Nicolas Maduro for drug trafficking. They designated him as a narcoterrorist.
Donald Trump: (36:25)
Sounds appropriate.
Speaker 8: (36:27)
It’s also expected that Venezuela is going to get hit really hard by the coronavirus. Does the administration see this as a weak point for the Maduro regime?
Donald Trump: (36:35)
Well, no. No, we don’t look at a weak point. This is a serious problem for over 150 nations, the virus. I would say this. Maduro and Venezuela, we’re watching it very closely. We’ll see what happens. But that is correct. Those charges were made. Please.
Speaker 9: (36:50)
You said a moment ago that you used the Defense Production Act on two minor occasions. What were those?
Donald Trump: (36:55)
We will give you that notification. We’ll let you know.
Speaker 10: (36:57)
Can I follow up on John’s question about the classifying for counties? A lot of these areas have not done testing yet. Is it safe to say that the current guidelines will be extended into next week? Will you wait to change those guidelines until you have the data [crosstalk 00:01:23]?
Donald Trump: (37:23)
I want those guidelines to go even when we’re open and fully operational, and frankly, much of the guidelines like shaking hands, maybe people aren’t going to be shaking hands anymore. Tony had mentioned to me, Tony Fauci, the other day that I don’t think he would be too upset with the concept of not shaking hands. He was saying that the flu would cut down, the regular flu would be cut down by quite a bit if we didn’t do that, if we didn’t shake hands. Even the regular flu, of which we have a lot of deaths and a lot of problems with that too. So I think a lot of great things are going to… When we’re open, as soon as we open, that doesn’t mean you’re going to stop with the guidelines. You’ll still try and distance yourself, maybe not to the same extent because you have to lead a life. But I think the time is coming. How about one more question? Go ahead, in the back.
Speaker 11: (38:13)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I also have two questions because I’m asking on behalf of foreign press as well. So one domestic question, one international. Domestically, you just tweeted the other day saying that it’s very important that we totally protect Asian Americans.
Donald Trump: (38:31)
Yes, I do. Very important to me.
Speaker 11: (38:33)
But still millions-
Donald Trump: (38:34)
Very important to me. We have to protect our Asian Americans. It’s very important, that was a very important tweet to me because I didn’t like things that I was hearing. Please go ahead.
Speaker 11: (38:43)
Well, what’s the concrete measure that you’ll take to combat the hate crimes against the Asians?
Donald Trump: (38:48)
Well I don’t know. All I know is this. Asian Americans in our country are doing fantastically well. I’m very close to them as you know, and they’re doing fantastically well. And I think they appreciate the job we’re doing, but I did want to put that statement out, the social media statement, because to me Asian Americans are a great part of our country. Thank you all very much. We’ll see you soon. Thank you.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (52:10)
There are a large group of people who are asymptomatic, who have never presented for any test. In order to have the kind of numbers that were predicted, to get to 60 million people infected or have six million people infected, you have to have a large group of asymptomatics. Because in no country to date have we seen an attack rate over one in a thousand. So either we’re only measuring the tip of the iceberg of the symptomatic cases, and underneath it are a large group of people. So we’re working very hard to get that antibody test because that’s a good way to figure out who are all these people under here and do they exist? Or we have the transmission completely wrong. So these are the things we’re looking at because the predictions of the models don’t match the reality on the ground in either China, South Korea or Italy. We are about five times the size of Italy.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (53:11)
So if we were Italy and you did all those divisions, Italy should have close to 400,000 deaths. They’re not close to achieving that. So these are the kinds of things we’re trying to understand. Models are models. We’re adapting now to the react… There’s enough data now of the real experience with the coronavirus on the ground to really make these predictions much more sound. So when people start talking about 20% of a population getting infected, it’s very scary. But we don’t have data that matches that based on the experience. And then finally, the situation about ventilators, we were reassured in meeting with our colleagues in New York that there are still ICU beds remaining, and there’s still significant, over a 1,000 or 2,000 ventilators, that have not been utilized yet.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (54:03)
Please, for the reassurance of people around the world, to wake up this morning and look at people talking about creating DNR situations, do not resuscitate situations for patients. There is no situation in the United States right now that warrants that kind of discussion. You can be thinking about it in a hospital. Certainly many hospitals talk about this on a daily basis, but to say that to the American people… to make the implication that when they need a hospital bed, it’s not going to be there, or when they need that ventilator, it’s not going to be there. We don’t have an evidence of that right now, and it’s our job collectively to assure the American people that… it’s our collective job to make sure that doesn’t happen.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (54:51)
Right now, you can see these cases are concentrated in highly urban areas. There are other parts of the states that have lots of ventilators and other parts of New York state that don’t have any infections right now, so we can be creative, we can meet the need by being responsive, but there is no model right now… I mean, no reality on the ground where we can see that 60 to 70% of Americans are going to get infected in the next eight to 12 weeks. I just want to be clear about that.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (55:22)
So, we’re adapting to the reality on the ground. We’re looking at the models of how they can inform, but we also are learning very clearly from South Korea and from Italy and from Spain. Just a final, because I know many of you will look up my numbers… the only people who are over really one in a thousand cases are people that have very small populations like Monaco and Lichtenstein, so you will see a different number coming from when your population is really tiny; one case can put you over one to a thousand or two to a thousand. Thank you.
Mike Pence: (55:59)
We’ll do questions involving Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Fauci: (56:02)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I’m going to change the topic just a little bit because there was the questions that came up and I had been asked about this on a couple of media interactions regarding the interventions that we’re talking about. And it’s important because it’s about something that I said yesterday, about what we would likely see… whenever you put the clamps down and shut things down, you do it for two reasons: you do it to prevent the further spread; this we call mitigation, but are you also do it to buy yourself time to get better prepared for what might be a rebound. It may be a rebound that we get things really under control and then you pull back, which ultimately we’re going to have to do. Everybody in the world is going to have to do that. You’re either going to get a rebound or it might cycle into the next season.
Dr. Fauci: (56:46)
So, what are we going to do to prepare ourselves for that? One of the most important things is one that I mentioned several times from this podium, and that is to clarify a bit about the timeline for vaccines, and would that have any real impact on what we would call the rebound, or what we would call a cycling in the season?
Dr. Fauci: (57:06)
Certainly, for sure, a vaccine is not going to help us now, next month, the month after. But as I mentioned to you, we went into a phase one trial, and I keep referring to one vaccine; there’s more than one. There’s a couple of handfuls of vaccines at different stages of development, but they’re all following the same course, and the course is, you first go in to a phase one trial to see if it’s safe, and you have very few people, 45 people within a certain age group: all healthy, none at really any great risk of getting infected.
Dr. Fauci: (57:39)
And the reason you do that… because you want to make sure that it’s safe. Then the next thing you do… and that takes about three months easily, maybe more; so that’s going to bring us into the beginning or middle of the summer. Then you go to a phase two trial or what we say two-three, which means we’re going to put a lot of people in there. Now, we hope that there aren’t a lot of people getting infected, but it is likely there will be somewhere in the world where that’s going on, so it’s likely that we will get what’s called an efficacy signal, and we will know whether or not it actually works.
Dr. Fauci: (58:11)
If, in fact, it does, we hope to rush it to be able to have some impact on re-cycling in the next season, and like I said, that could be a year to a year and a half. I’m not changing any of the dates that I mentioned. But one of the things that we are going to do that you need to understand, that has been a stumbling block for previous development of vaccines, and that is… even before you know something works, at risk, you have to start producing it because once you know it works, you can’t say, “Great, it works. Now give me another six months to produce it.” So we’re working with a variety of companies to take that risk. We didn’t take it with Zika. That’s why we have a nice Zika vaccine, but we don’t have enough to do it because there’s no Zika around; same with SARS. So that’s one of the things we’re really going to push on, is to be able to have it ready if, in fact, it works.
Dr. Fauci: (59:06)
Now, the issue of safety… something that I want to make sure the American public understand. It’s not only safety. When you inject somebody and they get maybe an idiosyncratic reaction, they get a little allergic reaction, or they get pain. There’s safety associated… does the vaccine make you worse? And there are diseases in which you vaccinate someone, they get infected with what you’re trying to protect them with, and you actually enhance the infection. You can get a good feel for that in animal models. So, that’s going to be interspersed at the same time that we’re testing. We’re going to try and make sure we don’t have enhancement. It’s the worst possible thing you could do, is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse.
Dr. Fauci: (59:51)
Next. And finally, with regard… I’ll get you to your question. Finally with regard to therapies… I mean, we keep getting asked about therapies. There’s a whole menu of therapies that are going into clinical trial. As I’ve told you all on a repeated… again, the best way to get the best drug as quickly as possible is to do a randomized controlled trial so that you know, is it safe and is it effective? If it’s not effective, get it off the board and go to the next thing. If it is effective, get it out to the people that need it. So, you’re going to be hearing over the next month or more about different drugs that are going to go into these randomized controlled trials. And I feel confident knowing about what this virus is and what we can do with it, that we will have some sort of therapy that will give at least a partial, if not a very good protection, in preventing progression of disease. And we’ll be back here talking about that a lot, I’m sure. Thank you
Mike Pence: (01:00:48)
Tony, you can take a question. Go ahead.
John: (01:00:51)
If I could just get back to what you’re saying about this idea of risk and drug manufacturer. Are you saying that at some point in the phase two trials, that if you’re seeing some form of efficacy, that you may try to convince a laboratory to school up production at that point so that there’s a reason-
Dr. Fauci: (01:01:06)
Even before, even before. When I go into phase two, I’m going to find somebody that’s going to make it.
John: (01:01:11)
[crosstalk 01:01:10].
Dr. Fauci: (01:01:14)
Partially the federal government, I think in some respects, to de-risk it, but also investments by the companies. A lot of companies are not shy now about doing that. Usually when you do that at risk, John, you’ve got to give some backup for them, and we’ve done that. We’ve put hundreds of millions of dollars into companies to try and make vaccines. I wouldn’t hesitate to do that for a moment, now
Speaker 13: (01:01:33)
On the county issue, let’s talk about having low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk counties… Dr. Birx, but there’s no domestic travel restrictions. What’s to prevent somebody from a high-risk county going to a low-risk county? Don’t you risk creating a patchwork system, allowing more cases to slip through the cracks and the virus to spread in other areas of the country?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:01:56)
I think this is a very important concept and it’s why we’ve really worked on messaging to the American people about these 15 days to stop the spread, because part of this will be the need to have highly responsible behavior between counties, and I think the American people can understand that, that they will understand where the virus is, because we’ll have the testing data and where it isn’t, and make sure that they’re taking appropriate precautions as they move in and out of spaces. I think this will be critical for our future as we work together to really understand where the virus is and where it isn’t in real time.
Speaker 14: (01:02:37)
Can I just follow up on sort of your modeling. Everyone’s talking about this Neil Ferguson study out of Imperial and how the modeling’s changed. You, last week, said… or it was on Monday that you talked about a serology test, something promising coming out of Singapore. Where are we on a serology test? The President said very quickly. And then, is that what you need to do, some sort of community survey so you can get to some of these X and Zs so you can figure this all out?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:02:59)
So, we’re talking to CDC right now. They are extraordinary in outbreaks and contact tracing. So, they are going to be the workforce behind any new strategy that looks at counties that need to completely move into containment and surveillance and contact tracing. But part of what they’re looking at now is, where are these antibody assays? To be clear, there is antibody assays available right now, but they’re by ELISA. And what we’re trying to do is not just do ELISAs, because they can use that now, but to be able to have point-of-care rapid diagnostics like we have with HIV, where you just get a drop of blood, you put it on a little cassette, and it tells you if you’re positive or negative. So, that’s what companies are working on.
Speaker 14: (01:03:43)
[crosstalk 00:09:41].
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:03:44)
Yes, correct. That’s the IgG to measure. Now remember, that’s not going to be helpful in diagnosis. That’s going to be helpful for us to know how many asymptomatic cases there are, or were.
John: (01:03:57)
How close are we to figuring out what the asymptomatic rates are? Because that seems to be the big question here. [crosstalk 01:03:59]
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:03:58)
It is a big question. It is a very big question, and so, we have people… the FDA is working on that around the clock. They do have applications that are coming in. We put out a call for applications. I’ve been talking about it from this podium. If you have an IgG assay rapid test, not an ELISA… I mean, you could do the ELISA today because the SARS… the original SARS antigens react very well to the current COVID-19 antibodies that people have. But we’re really working on that, both so that we could have therapeutics that could be plasma-derived, so thank you. Yes, we’re very much focused on that.
Speaker 15: (01:04:40)
How soon will you be able to classify these counties, because there’s a lot of testing that has not been done yet?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:04:47)
Well, there are states, and I just want to really recognize state and local health officials that, behind all of this, have continued to test and have continued to do surveillance. So, we do have states that have been doing surveillance all along, who have been doing contact tracing all along. It never gets reported because it’s not that exciting that they’ve identified 10 cases, but there are states doing that and have been doing it throughout this entire outbreak, and that’s why we have some confidence that that testing has been going on. We have to expand testing for surveillance.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:05:23)
But this is that… we talked about it a little bit yesterday, the flu platform? So the flu platform is driven off of emergency rooms and hospitals reporting flu-like illness to their state and local governments, and that, then, will trigger the individuals to get tested. So we have a platform that states and local governments are completely used to. They’re not used to doing it this late in the season. They’ll do it usually through the end of March, but flu usually tails off a lot by April. So, we’re asking them to continue the activation of screening for flu-like illness.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:06:01)
Now, that doesn’t get to his question about, where is the asymptomatics and how much of that? That helps us find cases and contact trace on systematic cases.
Speaker 16: (01:06:12)
So, will there be different guidance for the places, the counties that don’t have good data yet? Will there be different CDC guidelines?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:06:21)
So these are very early days of us trying to… what we’re trying to do is to utilize a laser- focused approach rather than a generic, horizontal approach. And I think in the 21st century, we should be able to get to that. Why am I confident that we can do that? Because we do that in Sub-Saharan Africa right now for HIV. That’s how we’re stopping the epidemic there. So we’ve done it; we’ve done it in resource-limited settings. So I do believe we can transpose that approach here to the United States and be able to have… we have granular data down to a GPS coordinate of a site of a clinic and hospital. We think that same thing can be done in the United States.
Speaker 17: (01:07:04)
Quick question on the restrict… when you said no restrictions to states for something like that… if there was a high-risk county, and the restaurants are open in a low-risk county, wouldn’t your fear be that people in that high- risk county go over to the restaurants in that low-risk district?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:07:17)
These are dialogues that the federal government has to have with state and local governments, because state and local governments make those decisions, and that’s what’s been inspirational to me, is seeing how much the governors understand where they are in their epidemic and what they will need to do in the future.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:07:33)
This is what we’re trying to tailor. It requires us to have very clear data disaggregation at the county and state level. But I think you’ve been hearing from us, these outbreaks and clusters, we’ve been able to very well define, to date… the one that was in King County, the one that is now in New York City, the one in New Orleans, the one in Wayne County… and we can see that spread throughout the region and as closely-related counties. So this is what we’re talking about, how to do surveillance, how to do contact tracing, and how to do each of these items to make sure that you prevent that spread.
Speaker 17: (01:08:11)
What’s your timeline? What’s your timeline for implementing guidance like this?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:08:17)
Well, we have to get all of our data together. We owe it to the President, and we owe it to the President to be able to make that decision. So that’s what we’re working on right now, is getting that granularity.
Mike Pence: (01:08:26)
I can speak to that, too.
Speaker 18: (01:08:28)
All right guys, last question.
Mike Pence: (01:08:28)
I’ll go to John for a second. I can speak to that.
Mike Pence: (01:08:30)
The President sent a letter to all the governors today indicating that, as every American recognizes, that the importance of 15 days to slow the spread… that we’re approaching day 15. And what the president told the governors, that we’re going to listen to the very best health experts in the world, we’re going to examine that data very carefully and we’ll be presenting this weekend, the President, a range of recommendations and additional guidance for going forward.
Mike Pence: (01:09:03)
The President’s made it clear that, in his words, he wants to open the country up, but we’re going to do that responsibly, and as the President told the governors today, we’ll do that based on the data. John, one last one.
Speaker 17: (01:09:14)
Can I ask a quick follow-up, Mr. Vice President?
Mike Pence: (01:09:15)
I’ll just go to John, [inaudible 00:15:16].
John: (01:09:17)
Unless there was a last minute glitch, we should probably see phase three pass the house tomorrow. Already there are many members who are talking about the need for a phase four. Do you see the need for a phase four, and if so, what do you think should be addressed in it?
Mike Pence: (01:09:35)
Well, first, let me just say again how grateful the President and I, and I know governors across the country are, for the extraordinary bi-partisan work that’s been done on Capitol Hill, not just in the bill that will be taken up by the House of Representatives tomorrow, but in legislation last week that extended paid family leave; free coronavirus testing to every American; made sure that all the agencies at every level of the federal government had the resources to meet this moment. It’s really been a very inspiring time.
Mike Pence: (01:10:07)
But what the president’s made clear to our governors, we’re going to do whatever it takes. And already, we’re hearing from some governors about the need for additional resources, and we will evaluate those very carefully, and I think the Secretary of the Treasury has already indicated, and Congressional leadership has already indicated a willingness to remain open to that. The American people know we’re all in this together, and the unity that you see on Capitol Hill, the unity that this President has marshaled among governors all across this country and our States and territories will continue to drive forward, and we’re going to make sure the people on the front lines… our healthcare workers and the people that are serving them… make sure our state governments, make sure every agency of the federal government have everything we need to put the health of America first. We’ll see you back here tomorrow. Thank you all."
"Mar 25, 2020","6, 2020
4:43 P.M EST","Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much. So, nice to be with you. America continues to gain ground in the war against the virus. I want to thank the American people for answering the call, following our guidelines and making the sacrifices required to overcome this terrible threat more aggressively. We commit to social distancing. So important social distancing, such an important phrase, and we do it right now the more lives we can save and the sooner we can eventually get people back to work, back to school, and back to normal. And there are large sections of our country probably can go back much sooner than other sections and we’re obviously looking at that also. People are asking, “Is that an alternative? And I say, “Absolutely. It is an alternative.”
Donald Trump: (01:11)
I have now approved major disaster declarations for New York, California, Washington, Iowa, Louisiana, Texas, and Florida. That has great significance as you know, and legal significance. We’re in a constant grouping and I can say this we have a large grouping of people that does nothing but communicate with the various officials including, we’ve been spending a lot of time with New York officials because that really is by far the hottest spot. They’ve got a number of very tough weeks ahead of them. The governor is doing a very good job. I spoke to the governor, Governor Cuomo, last night and this morning and he mentioned that in his remarks that he’s using, that we are using and I think he feels, cause he understands negotiation, he thinks we’re using very appropriately the Defense Production Act and we are. We’re using it where needed. It’s a great point of leverage. It’s a great negotiating tool. But I’ve really, I will tell you there’s tremendous spirit from people and tremendous spirit with respect to these companies and I don’t have to use it very much at all. They want to do it. As you know, General Motors is involved, Ford’s involved, 3M’s involved, others are involved and they’re all working very hard to produce product, different, all different products. We had very little product when we came. We built it up and we give it away as fast as we can to the different states.
Donald Trump: (02:59)
We’re also, as you know, building numerous hospitals and medical centers throughout certain areas. In New York it’s at the convention center, the Javits Convention Center. We’re doing four hospitals and we’re doing throughout the state four medical centers there, somewhat different. I want you to know that I’m doing everything in my power to help the city pull through this challenge. I’m working very hard on New York. It’s really by far our biggest problem. Maybe it will be, maybe it won’t be, but there’s a lot of good capable people working on it with us and our teams are working very well with the state representatives. We’re also doing some very large testings throughout the country. I told you yesterday that in South Korea, and this is not a knock in any way because I just spoke with President Moon, we had a very good conversation about numerous other things, but they’ve done a very good job in testing but we now are doing more testing than anybody by far. We do more in eight days than they do in eight weeks and we go up on a daily basis exponentially, so it’s really good.
Donald Trump: (04:12)
By the way, while I’m on it, I also spoke with Prime Minister Abe of Japan last night and I congratulated him on a wise choice. I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics, 2021. I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics. It was the absolute right decision to delay it for a full year and now have a full beautiful Olympics. It’s going to be very important because it’s probably the first time, maybe ever or certainly in a long time that it was on a odd year. It’s always on an even year they tell me. But he’s going to have a fantastic success and now they’ll have even more time. He didn’t need any more time. Everything was perfectly ready. What a job they’ve done. But Japan, I want to congratulate Japan, the IOC, and Prime Minister Abe on a great decision. I think it’s going to be a fantastic Olympics. I told him I’ll be there, I’ll be there.
Donald Trump: (05:04)
As we fight to protect American lives, we’re also protecting American livelihoods. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are very close to passing an emergency relief bill for American workers, families, and businesses. This legislation in addition to the two bills I signed this month that includes, as you know, sick leave and we have all sorts of things in for the workers, for families, but we have a tremendous paid sick leave provision for workers at no cost at all to the employers. And that’s a big thing, no cost to the employers. We want to get everybody back working. Together, this $2.2 trillion legislative package is bigger than anything I believe ever passed in Congress. Perhaps, relatively speaking, if you go back look during the FDR New Deal days there was something that if you time value it you could say it was bigger. I don’t know, but this is certainly in terms of dollars by far and away the biggest ever, ever done, and that’s a tremendous thing because a lot of this money goes to jobs, jobs, jobs and families, families, families.
Donald Trump: (06:28)
The Senate bill, as you know, includes $350 billion in job retention loans for small businesses with loan forgiveness available for businesses that continue paying their workers. They continue paying their workers. That’s what we want. We want them to keep their workers and pay their workers. This will help businesses keep workers in the payroll and allow our economy to quickly accelerate as soon as we defeat the virus. $300 billion in direct cash payments will be available for every American citizen earning less than $99,000 per year. That would be $3,400 very quickly for the typical family of four. Nothing like that’s ever been done in our country. Up to $250 billion in expanded unemployment benefits. The average worker who has lost his or her job will receive 100% of their salary for up to four full months. Unlike normal unemployment benefits, independent contractors and the self-employed will be eligible, so you have independent contractors and self-employed people will be eligible for this.
Donald Trump: (07:41)
Over $100 billion to support the heroic work of our doctors, nurses and hospitals. They have been incredible. $45 billion for Disaster Relief Fund. We are setting up a fund, a $45 billion for disaster relief. That’s more than doubling the amount available to support my national emergency and disaster declarations. It’s a doubling up. $27 billion to build up the Strategic National Stockpile with critical supplies including masks, respirators, pharmaceuticals, and everything you can imagine because it was very depleted like our military was depleted. Now we have a brand new military. Never had a military like this. We have equipment either coming or it’s already come, for the most part it’s already come, but we have a lot of things that will soon be coming; planes, missiles, rockets, lots of things. But the stockpile was very depleted like everything else.
Donald Trump: (08:45)
This will also include significant funding for the development of vaccines on top of the $8 billion we approved several weeks ago. Over $500 billion in support for the hardest hit industries with a ban on corporate stock buybacks, which is something I insisted on and frankly I tell you the Republicans wanted that and the Democrats wanted that. We want them to use the money for the companies and the planes or whatever they may be helping to get over this rough patch. And I don’t think it’s going to end up being such a rough patch. I think it’s going to, when we open, especially if we can open it the sooner the better, it’s going to open up like a rocket ship. I think it’s going to go very good and very quickly.
Donald Trump: (09:33)
You’re going to have some tough new limits on executive compensation also. They need the money. They’re going to have to sort of just make things work cause we’re interested in the workers, the jobs, and we’re interested in the companies cause that’s really what fuels the workers in those great jobs. We also have $16 billion in funding for the purchase of personal protective equipment, you know about that, such as masks and respirators through the Strategic National Stockpile.
Donald Trump: (10:07)
I encourage the House to pass this vital legislation and send the bill to my desk for signature without delay. I will sign it immediately. We will have a signing and it’ll be a great signing and a great day for the American worker and for American families and frankly for American companies, some of which were having the best years they’ve ever had, those last few years, and then little bit less than a month ago they went into a position that they haven’t seen because of the hidden enemy, the virus.
Donald Trump: (10:43)
Earlier today I spoke to the leaders of many of America’s amazing nonprofit organizations. I thank them for their unwaving and unwavering devotion to American people, to American families, to our nation. They have been fantastic. They’ve been collecting supplies, distributing food, supporting healthcare workers, caring for vulnerable workers and families. I encourage them to continue to do it, but I’ll tell you the nonprofits have been fantastic. They’ve been great. They’re great people actually. I know a lot of them.
Donald Trump: (11:18)
Finally, I want to provide a brief update on the critical supplies through FEMA. The federal government has delivered or is in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators, think of that 9.4 million, 20 million surgical masks and we have others that we think are going to be delivered pretty quickly. The whole world, you know it’s not just us, it’s not just the states, the whole world is trying to get these things, so in competition with many, many countries. I believe today you broke the 150 mark for the virus. We have 150 countries, over 150 countries where you have this virus and nobody would ever believe a thing like that’s possible. Nobody could have ever seen something like this coming, but now we know and we know it can happen and happen again. And if it does, somebody’s going to be very well prepared because of what we’ve learned and how we’ve done. It’s been incredible how we’ve done.
Donald Trump: (12:18)
Remember, there’s more tests than anybody by far and the news, the reporters, the media always likes to bring South Korea. They called me and they told me it’s amazing, your testing procedures are amazing. Plus we have a test that’s a very high level test and it’s a test that’s very accurate. 3.1 million face shields, 2.6 million surgical gowns, 14.6 million gloves, and almost 6,000 ventilators which go to the areas of greatest needs. We sent over the last day 4,000 ventilators to New York and I spoke with the governor about that. He was happy. I spoke with the mayor also about that, Mayor de Blasio. He was very happy. It’s hard not to be happy with the job we’re doing that I can tell you.
Donald Trump: (13:09)
Throughout this national emergency, everyday heroes continue to step forward and demonstrate the extraordinary character of our nation, including the people behind me. By the way, these people are amazing. They are amazing people and they become, I don’t know, maybe I should just speak for myself, but to me they’ve become friends. Maybe they don’t like me. Maybe they don’t. Maybe they do. I don’t know. All I can tell you is they’re talented people, they work very hard.
Donald Trump: (13:35)
In Maryland, a seven-year-old boy used his own birthday money to buy meals for dozens of senior citizens. In Nevada, a college student recruited 90 of her friends to help deliver groceries and supplies to the most vulnerable. This is happening all over the country, thousands and thousands of instances. I could stand up here all day and tell you about other things. In Minnesota, hundreds of medical students have volunteered to provide childcare for hospital workers, helping to keep our doctors and nurses on the front lines fighting to save lives. These inspiring Americans remind us that we all have a role to play in winning this great national battle and it’s really a worldwide battle. We’re dealing with other nations all the time The people here are. I am a little bit. I take calls from a lot of people. They’re in trouble. A lot of countries are in big trouble.
Donald Trump: (14:27)
So, now we will hear from our great Secretary of the Treasury. He’s been working rather hard I will tell you. Steven Mnuchin is a fantastic guy and he loves our country and he’s been dealing with both sides, Republican and Democrats. He sort of lived over in that beautiful building. It’s a very beautiful building, to me one of the most beautiful buildings actually in the world, and he’s gotten to know it, Steve, very well. So if we could have a little update Steve would be fantastic as to how we’re doing and what it’s looking like. Thank you.
Steve Mnuchin: (15:02)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. First let me say, I would like to thank Mitch McConnell for his leadership and I’d also like to thank Chuck Schumer for the enormous bipartisan support we had on this bill and the many senators, both Republicans and Democrats that worked tirelessly over the last five days on all the task force. As the President said, I got to live in the LBJ Room for the last five days and we couldn’t be more pleased with the unprecedented response from the Senate to protect American workers and American business in this situation.
Steve Mnuchin: (15:39)
The President has outlined many of these, but let me just quickly go through them. Again, small business retention loans. This will cover roughly 50% of the private payroll in small businesses where we will immediately make loans that will supply eight weeks of salaries as long as they keep workers employed and overhead. Those loans will be forgiven at the end of the period as long as they keep workers employed. These are SBA loans, but the Treasury will be issuing new regulations authorizing almost every single FDIC insured bank to make these. I expect by the end of next week we will have a very simple process where these can be made and dispersed in the same day, so this will be a very simple system to get money into small business hands.
Steve Mnuchin: (16:33)
For companies that don’t qualify that we have a economic program of tax incentives to retain workers, and as the President said we have enhanced unemployment insurance for people don’t fit into these two programs that will be administered through the states. We also have economic impact payments. These will be within the next three weeks direct payments into most people’s deposit accounts and for those that don’t have it we will be having the checks in the mail. Treasury will have additional authorities. We have $500 billion that we can use to work with the Federal Reserve for emergency programs that will create up to an additional $4 trillion if needed to support American business and American workers in an unprecedented way. And then finally, the President mentioned $100 billion to hospitals and $150 billion to states that have specific Coronavirus expenses as well as many additional things.
Steve Mnuchin: (17:38)
Mr. President, I especially want to thank you and the Vice President. You were constantly available to us. We spoke constantly throughout the day. You gave us guidance and quick decisions on many issues, and again thank everybody for this great bipartisan work. This is going to be enormous help for the American workers and the American economy. The President was very determined that Congress would move swiftly to protect hardworking Americans and business in this unprecedented situation.
Donald Trump: (18:07)
Thank you very much, Steve. Great job. Day and night, right?
Steve Mnuchin: (18:11)
[inaudible 00:18:11].
Donald Trump: (18:11)
Day and night we were [inaudible 00:18:13]. That was a lot of work and we’ll see how it all goes. We still need a vote, Steve, don’t we? Do you have a question? Yes.
Speaker 1: (18:20)
How long do you think this bill will keep the economy afloat?
Donald Trump: (18:23)
Hopefully a long time. You know, we’ll see. If we have to go back, we have to go back. We’re going to take care of the American worker. We’re going to take care of these companies that fuel this country and make the country great. It’s not their fault. It’s not their fault, but we think…
Steve Mnuchin: (18:37)
I would say, we have anticipated three months. Hopefully you won’t need this for three months. Hopefully this war will be won quicker, but we expect that this is a significant amount of money if needed to cover the economy.
Donald Trump: (18:52)
And don’t forget, a lot of this is going to be to keep companies that are very strong, AAA-rated companies previously, to keep them going and it’s going to be in the form of loans, so the money’s going to come back. This money’s…
Donald Trump: (19:03)
And it’s going to be in the form of loans, so the money’s going to come back. A lot of this money’s coming back.
Steve: (19:05)
Separately, let me ask you about something you said yesterday. You said we should never be reliant on a foreign country for the means of our own survival.
Donald Trump: (19:13)
Yeah.
Steve: (19:13)
What did you mean by that?
Donald Trump: (19:14)
Well, I’ve been saying that for a long time. Well, we’re reliant on many countries, where we give up our supply chains. We give up our factories. We give up our production facilities and we can buy it someplace else for a little bit lower price. But it’s really costing us more when that happens, because we lose jobs, we lose everything and we lose our independence and we can’t let that happen. So we’ll be making some changes. We have been making those changes.
Steve: (19:39)
[Inaudible 00:19:39] considering an executive order to basically ban the export of medical equipment?
Donald Trump: (19:43)
I don’t know that we’ll need that, but I think it’s happening by itself. I think a lot of things are happening. Well, we make the best medical equipment in the world, and you have some people like the European Union, they don’t take it because they have specifications that don’t allow our equipment in because it’s designed in a different way, even though it’s a better way. It’s designed. They’re all playing games against us, okay. They’ve been playing games against us for years and no president has ever done anything about it.
Donald Trump: (20:16)
But the European Union, you look at medical equipment, we make the best medical equipment in the world, but we can’t sell it, or not appropriately. And yet we take their medical equipment in our country. We’re changing things, Steve. All of this is changing. But they have specifications, designed specifically, so that our equipment can’t come into their countries. It’s a very terrible thing that’s happened to our country.
Donald Trump: (20:46)
And let me tell you some of the people that took the biggest advantage of us, our allies. We talk about allies, they took advantage of us in many ways, financially as well as even militarily. Look, if you look at NATO, the abuse that was given to our country on NATO, where they wouldn’t pay, and we were paying for everybody. Now, because of me, they’re paying a lot. Now, they’ve paid 125, 135, billion dollars more.
Donald Trump: (21:23)
And then ultimately Secretary General Stoltenberg, who I think you would say is maybe my biggest fan, we got him to pay an additional $400 billion, billion, other countries. But you know that. And then there’s the trade. They make it almost impossible for us to have a fair deal. They know this. They know I’m just waiting. We have all the advantages, by the way. It’s going to be easy when I decide to do it, but this isn’t the right time to do it. But we’ve been treated very, very unfairly by the European union.
Donald Trump: (21:56)
Please, go ahead.
Speaker 2: (21:57)
Mr. President, four Republican senators have indicated that the extra $600 for unemployment insurance may encourage workers to leave their jobs, even though you can only collect unemployment if you’re fired. I’m curious what you think of that concern.
Donald Trump: (22:13)
I know the issue very well. We talked about it just a little while ago. I’ll let, Steve, I’m going to let you maybe discuss that.
Steve Mnuchin: (22:19)
Sure. Now, the president, I spoke to several of those senators today. But let me explain the issue, which is we wanted to have enhanced unemployment insurance. Most of the States systems have technology that’s 30 years old or older. So if we had the ability to customize this with much more specifics, we would have. This was the only way we could assure that the States could get money out quickly, in a fair way. So we used $600 across the board. And I don’t think it’ll create incentives. Most Americans, what they want, they want to keep their jobs. And I said for 50% of these businesses, they will have the businesses keep those jobs. Our number one issue was how do we make sure that American workers who needed to keep getting paid, this is no fault of their own, that businesses have been shut down. The president and vice president wanted to make sure those hardworking Americans got money and this was the most efficient way of doing it.
Speaker 2: (23:19)
The senators that you spoke with, are they in agreement now?
Steve Mnuchin: (23:22)
I’m not going to comment on the specifics of where they are, but I would say, our expectation is this bill passes tonight and gets to the house tomorrow and they pass it. We need to get this money into the American economy and American workers. That’s the importance of this.
Donald Trump: (23:38)
The one good thing, when you think about that, people would get actually more money, but we don’t want to give a disincentive. But they have been talking about that. It’s a good question, actually. Yes, ma’am, please.
Speaker 3: (23:49)
Yes, thank you. On another subject, the family of retired FBI agent, Robert Levinson, says that US officials have concluded that he’s died in Iranian custody. Are you aware of that? And how did US officials reach that conclusion?
Donald Trump: (24:05)
I’ve been very much involved in that. He was a great gentleman and a great family. I have to say this and they’ve been making the statement to the family, I believe, but it’s not looking good. He wasn’t well for years, anyway, in Iran. It’s not looking promising. We’ve gotten so many people back. We got two people back this week, but Robert Levinson, who was outstanding, he’s been sick for a long time. He had some rough problems prior to his detainment or capture. We feel terribly for the family.
Speaker 3: (24:49)
Do you accept that he is dead?
Donald Trump: (24:51)
No, I don’t accept that he’s dead. I don’t accept it. I’m telling you, it’s not looking great, but I won’t accept that he’s dead. They haven’t told us that he’s dead. But a lot of people are thinking that that is the case. Feel badly about it.
Speaker 4: (25:07)
Mr. President, you tweeted earlier, linking the closing of the country to your election success in November. Is this Easter timeline based on your political interests?
Donald Trump: (25:19)
What do you mean by election success? No.
Speaker 4: (25:19)
You tweeted. You said that the media wants the country to remain closed to hurt your odds of being reelected.
Donald Trump: (25:24)
No, no, no. I think the media would like to see me do poorly in the election.
Speaker 4: (25:28)
Sir, lawmakers and economists on both sides of the aisle have said that reopening the country by Easter is not a good idea. What is that plan based on?
Donald Trump: (25:34)
Just so you understand. Are you ready? I think there are certain people that would like it not to open so quickly. I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls. And I don’t know if that’s so, but I do think it’s so that there are people in your profession that would like that to happen. I think it’s very clear.
Speaker 4: (25:58)
Your own medical expert does not endorse that plan.
Donald Trump: (25:59)
I think it’s very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news. You do. She does. There are people in your profession that write fake news. They would love to see me, for whatever reason, because we’ve done one hell of a job. Nobody’s done the job that we’ve done. And it’s lucky that you have this group here, right now, for this problem or you wouldn’t even have a country left. Okay.
Donald Trump: (26:23)
Go ahead in the back, please.
Speaker 5: (26:24)
Mr. President, two questions. The first one, once you sign the $2 trillion package, how soon or how rapidly do you expect to see economic-
Donald Trump: (26:30)
Who you with?
Speaker 5: (26:35)
I’m with CBN. And my second question is, we are hearing you are pushing for April 6, to have direct payments issued to tax payers. Is that the target date?
Donald Trump: (26:41)
I think it’s pretty much, yeah.
Steve Mnuchin: (26:42)
Again, I would say our expectation is within three weeks, we will have direct payments out where we have depository information. And we’re looking to get a lot more information and we have procedures to do that. So three weeks for that. And I would say the end of next week, we want all the banks to be able to originate loans, same day.
Speaker 6: (27:03)
Thank you, Mr. President. I have two questions for you. One is this, that tomorrow you’re going to be speaking with the G20 leaders, and I want to know if you’re going to lead an effort to craft a worldwide ban on wild animal markets, so as to prevent another pandemic, given that COVID-19 is a zoonotic that was transferred to humans in trade of exotic animals?
Donald Trump: (27:23)
I don’t know that that subject’s going to come up. There is a lot of talk that that’s how this all happened. Came out of China, and they say that’s how it happened in China. So it’s something maybe it will be talked about, but it’s not the top of my list. I think we’re going to have a very good conference tomorrow.
Speaker 6: (27:40)
And to follow up, also Dr. Ashish Jha, who is the head of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, says that the key to getting this economy open as soon as possible is to test everyone who needs testing so we can quarantine all infected individuals and allow everyone else to go back to work immediately. Would you subscribe to that strategy?
Donald Trump: (27:59)
No, but we have tested more than anybody. I saw him.
Speaker 6: (28:02)
And if not, how many deaths are acceptable?
Donald Trump: (28:05)
Yeah. How many? None. Okay. How many deaths are acceptable to me? None. Okay. None. If that’s your question. Look, I saw him. I saw his statement. We have tested, by far, more than anybody. We’re testing more than anybody right now. There’s nobody even close. And our tests are the best tests. They’re the most accurate tests. But if you’re saying we’re going to test 350 million people, I watched his statement, I disagree with it.
Donald Trump: (28:36)
We can go to certain States. I could name them now, but I’m not going to do that. But we can go to certain States right now. They have virtually no problem or a very small problem. We don’t have to test the entire state in the Middle West or wherever they may be. We don’t have to test the entire state. I think it’s ridiculous. We don’t have to do it. A lot of those States could go back right now and they probably will, because at some point in the not too distant future, certain States are going to come off the rolls. Maybe New York can’t and maybe California can’t. Maybe the state of Washington can’t. Although if you look at them, their biggest problem was in one nursing home. Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 6: (29:14)
But the States aren’t siloed. And so if you test one state and then the person moves over to the other state, well then.
Donald Trump: (29:21)
Yeah, you’re going to look at that. But if you take a look at the States and many States that I’m talking about, they don’t have a problem. We have some big problems, but it’s confined to certain areas, high density areas. So why would we test the entire nation, 350 people? With that being said, I’m going to say it again, we tested far more than anybody else. We have the ability to test… we’ve come a long way from an obsolete, broken system that I inherited. We have now tested, with the best test, far more than anybody else. When I say anybody else, I’m talking about other countries. No country is even close.
Donald Trump: (29:59)
They came out with a statistic, I guess a yesterday, that I heard from Dr. Burks where it’s for eight days here, more than eight weeks in South Korea. And South Korea has done a good job, but we did in eight days more than South Korea did in eight weeks. That’s a big number. And we’re getting, I said before, exponentially better. Every day is going up substantially. We have an incredible apparatus built, now. But no, I don’t want to test 350 million people. I think it’s ridiculous.
Donald Trump: (30:36)
Yes, please.
Speaker 7: (30:36)
Thank you so much, Mr. President. Two questions. One follow up on the G20, because the UN asked the G20 countries for more resources, for a coordinated seamless package, ban all tariffs, waive all sanctions, to try to prevent what they call an apocalyptic pandemic. Would you consider those measures and-
Donald Trump: (30:56)
With respect to what?
Speaker 7: (30:59)
On tariffs and related also to waive tariffs and also sanctions.
Donald Trump: (31:05)
Look, we have strong borders.
Speaker 7: (31:08)
Would you consider to join this global effort?
Donald Trump: (31:10)
Before I came here, we weren’t into borders. We had a country people could come in. We had a whole different deal. Now we’re up to almost 164 miles. Think of that, 164 miles of wall, big beautiful wall and in those areas it’s very, very tough to come in. We’ve been very tough on the borders. Where we have the wall built, nobody’s getting through. Now, they’re going around, but that’s a long trip. If they’re going around, that’s the way they get through. No, I’m very strong on borders and I don’t want people coming in here. What I want is, if they’re going to come in, they have to come in legally. They have to come in through merit. We’re not having the people that you’re talking about coming to our country.
Speaker 7: (31:55)
Mr. President, a followup on another question.
Donald Trump: (31:55)
Please.
Speaker 8: (31:55)
Thank you, sir. A question for you and for Dr. Fauci, if you’ll let me. Both Republican and Democrat packages of the stimulus, included $25 million worth of funding for the Kennedy Performance Art Center, here in Washington, DC. Shouldn’t that money be going to masks, respirators?
Donald Trump: (32:15)
Well, I approved that. And I knew… it was 35 million and we actually took off 10. But I’m a fan of that, although I haven’t spent time there because I’m far too busy. I’d love to go there evenings, but I’m too busy doing things, because that’s more important for me than going there. But the Kennedy Center has suffered greatly, because nobody can go there. It’s essentially closed. They do need some funding. I said, look, that was a Democrat request. That was not my request, but you’ve got to give them something. It’s something that they wanted. It works that way. Democrats have treated us fairly. I really believe that we’ve had a very good back and forth. And I say that with respect to Chuck Schumer. I spoke to him a number of times, but they had requests also. So that was a request.
Donald Trump: (33:03)
There were 35, as you know, and it came down to 25. We got it down to 25. We agreed. I said, “That’s a lousy soundbite. That’s not a good sound bite.” But that’s the way life works. With that being said, the Kennedy Center, they do a beautiful job, an incredible job. David Rubenstein does a fantastic job. He’s very much involved and he puts up a lot of money and he does things that a lot of people wouldn’t be able to do, or do. But they’ve been essentially closed. They have tremendous deficits that are built up. This thing has been devastating to it. So I didn’t have a big problem with it, but this was a request from the Democrats, because of the fact that they have a facility that’s essentially closed up.
Speaker 8: (33:43)
Another question, sir.
Donald Trump: (33:44)
Otherwise you couldn’t go there if you wanted to. If I wanted to go there tonight to look at Romeo and Juliet, I’d love to see Romeo and Juliet tonight. You know what would happen? They say, “Sorry.” 250 people or 50 people, whatever it might be down to. Go ahead.
Speaker 8: (33:57)
And then earlier today, Senator Marco Rubio told RCP that, “The World Health Organization showed favoritism to China.” and then Representative Michael McCaul, the ranking member on the house foreign relations committee, he questioned the integrity of the World Health Organization’s director, saying, “That there were several red flags in his past with respect to his relationship with China.” Do you agree? Do you think the World Health Organization showed favoritism and then once all the dust settles, do you think that the United States should re-explore its relationship with the World Health Organization?
Donald Trump: (34:30)
I think there is certainly a lot of talk that has been very unfair. I think that a lot of people feel that it’s been very unfair. It’s been very, very much sided with China and a lot of people are not happy about it. At the same time, Dr. Fauci and myself and other people, there are people on there that we like and we know. A lot of, I think your friends, are on there. A lot of good people, a lot of good professionals. I don’t know, it’d be interesting to hear if you’d like to talk about the WHO, but the fact is that, I have heard for years that that is very much biased toward China. So I don’t know.
Donald Trump: (35:08)
Dr., you want me to get you into this political mess?
Dr. Fauci: (35:10)
No, I don’t want you to do that, but I will. So Tedros is really an outstanding person. I’ve known him from the time that he was the minister of health of Ethiopia. Obviously, over the years, anyone who says that the WHO has not had problems, has not been watching the WHO. But I think under his leadership, they’ve done very well. He has been all over this. I was on the phone with him a few hours ago leading a WHO call.
Speaker 8: (35:37)
Praising China’s transparency, sir?
Dr. Fauci: (35:39)
No, I’m not talking about China. You asked me about Tedros.
Speaker 8: (35:43)
World Heath Organization praising China for its transparency and leadership on their response to the pandemic?
Dr. Fauci: (35:48)
I can’t comment on that, because I don’t have any viewpoint into it. I don’t even know what your question is.
Speaker 9: (35:57)
Can I follow up on that phone call, please?
Donald Trump: (35:59)
Welcome to the group. Let me just tell you, I have heard that for years. I spoke to him yesterday. Seems fine to me. I don’t know. But we’re the ones that gave the great response and we’re the ones that kept China out of here. And if I didn’t do it, you’d have thousands and thousands of people who would have died, that are now living and happy. If I didn’t do that early call on China, and nobody wanted that to happen. Everybody thought it was unnecessary to do it, and if we didn’t do that, thousands and thousands of people would’ve died, more than what’s happened. So that’s it. Maybe one more. Steve, go ahead.
Steve: (36:36)
When you have this G20 meeting tomorrow, what sort of coordinated response are you expecting?
Donald Trump: (36:40)
No coordinated… we’re going to have a meeting with the 20 nations total, including us. It’ll be a conference call tomorrow morning sometime. I look forward to people I know, I like. I think in every instance I like every one of them, but it’ll be an interesting call. You’ll be the first to know.
Steve: (36:59)
Next week when the 15 day period ends, what should we expect then? Are you going to extend it for another week or two?
Donald Trump: (37:05)
We’ll be talking. I’ll be speaking with Tony. I’ll be speaking with Deborah. I’ll be speaking with some of the people that they like and respect, and they’re going to bring along with them. We’ll be speaking to Vice President Mike Pence and Steve, and we’ll be speaking to everybody. I’m not going to do anything rash or hastily. I don’t do that. But the country wants to get back to work. Our country was built to get back to work.
Donald Trump: (37:29)
We don’t have a country where they say, “Hey, let’s close it down for two years.” We can’t do that. It’s not our country. So we’re going to be talking, and it could be we’ll do sections of our country. There’s big sections of our country that are very little affected by what’s taken place. Then there are other sections that are very heavily affected, so there’s a big difference. But no, I would say by Easter we’ll have a recommendation and maybe before Easter, and at the end of the 15th day or even during the 15th day, I think we’ll have some kind of a recommendation, but our country wants to get back to…
Donald Trump: (38:03)
Did they? I think we’ll have some kind of a recommendation, but our country wants to get back to work, Steve. I have had so many people and they want to practice social distancing and they want to practice no handshaking, no handshaking. They’re not going to go walk around hugging and kissing each other in the office where they come back. Even though they may feel like it. They’re going to do, they’re going to wash their hands more than they’ve ever done. They’re going to do all the things you’re supposed to do. But Steve, you know what? It’s time. They want people want to get back to work. I’m having, I get it from both sides. In all fairness, and maybe it’s a combination of both. Tony said before, combination of both is sometimes very good, but there are areas that possibly, probably they won’t qualify.
Donald Trump: (38:45)
There are other areas that qualify almost now. So we’re going to have to see what happens, but it’ll be an interesting period of time. I’d like to get our country back. I have tremendous numbers of people wanting to go back. You have store owners where the store is sitting there, they don’t know what’s happened. They got to get back. You have businesses that are going to be closed. The longer we stay out, the longer we do it. We want to go quickly. The longer we stay out, the harder it is to bring this incredible, we were having the most successful years that we’ve ever had in the history of our country. You saw what happened yesterday with the stocks and today they’re up. I’m telling you, if Steve gets the deal done, the incredible incentive that’s going to take care of people, it’s going to take care of our workers, going to take care of companies that employ all these workers. Small and big.
Donald Trump: (39:33)
By the way, I would say we spend more time on the small companies, Steve, than we did under big companies. People ask about that. We spent more time thinking about the small businesses than the big and that’s, but that really fuels our country. We want to get back and the people want to get back. We want to get our country going again and we’ll be able to do that. So Vice-President is going to stay with you and going to take a few more questions specifically and I will see you tomorrow. Thank you very much. [crosstalk 00:02:03]
Speaker 10: (40:06)
Mr. President, a question for you on the DPA.
Mike Pence: (40:15)
Well, thank you all. Report on today’s action by the White House Coronavirus Task Force. The president and our entire team continue to be inspired. By the way people all across this country are putting into practice 15 days to slow the spread. We are 10 days into the 15 days. And let me say again to every American, if you’re in an area that’s been impacted by the Coronavirus, it’s absolutely essential that you listen to state and local authorities for guidance. But for every American, what you can do is implement the practices outlined in the President’s coronavirus today because we truly do believe that as millions of Americans have done and will continue to do, that we can significantly impact the rate of growth in this epidemic in our country. We can spare Americans from exposure to the Coronavirus and we can save lives and so on behalf of the President and our entire task force, I want to say thank you to the American people.
Mike Pence: (41:26)
I thank you for your cooperation. Thank you for embracing the principles in 15 days to slow the spread. We heard about that cooperation today in a series of conference calls. We spoke with equipment manufacturers who are stepping forward as never before to assist us in developing the medical equipment that is essential, whether it be masks or other medical supplies or ventilators. FEMA reported to our task force today that hundreds of companies have stepped forward to be involved in the supply chain. And we are vetting nearly 70 of those companies for specific repurposing of their manufacturing to produce everything from mass to gloves to gowns and of course to ventilators. We also had a very productive call with Secretary Betsy DeVos with education leaders from around the country today. And let me say on behalf of the President and a grateful nation, thank you to all of our teachers, many of whom are now home teaching children from afar, even in many cases while they have their own kids home from school.
Mike Pence: (42:36)
You are truly heroes and the Department of Education as well as your state department of education are grateful to each and every one of you who find yourselves educating out of home. And the Department of Education has a helpful website on Coronavirus recommendations, ed.gov/coronavirus. And as we mentioned before, Secretary Betsy DeVos and Secretary Sonny Purdue will be joining us at this podium on Friday to speak about distance learning recommendations that have been made, not just for secondary or for college education, but also for K through 12 education. We’re opening up avenues, creating new flexibility so that not only college students can continue to be involved and learning from afar, but children K through 12 can do the same. Secretary Purdue will also be here to talk about the food lunch program and free and reduced lunches. Today the President and I also spoke to over 150 CEOs of the top nonprofit organizations in the country.
Mike Pence: (43:43)
We thanked them for their ongoing work, supplying the needs, not only of people impacted by the Coronavirus, but the most vulnerable among us in our communities. Organizations like Red Cross, the Salvation Army, Feeding America are all still working every day and we promised to urge every American if you have the means and have the ability, continue to be generous to nonprofit organizations that are helping those most in need in your community.
Mike Pence: (44:13)
The President marshaled a whole of government approach, that means working with our governors. Today, the president and I were in direct contact with governors of New York, California, Washington state, New Jersey, Michigan and others and we continue to be inspired and impressed by the leadership that governors are providing in their states, making tough choices, leading their states and the President and I are truly grateful. The task force made a recommendation and FEMA has assembled a team for to provide technical assistance to the state of New York and that team was welcomed by Governor Cuomo, will be arriving on the ground there very soon along with all the other resources that the President recently announced would be flowing to New York and to Washington state and to California.
Mike Pence: (45:04)
In my conversation with governor Gavin Newsom of California, I was pleased to speak to him and hear that our FEMA team is literally at the table with the state of California’s team working to meet their supply needs. Working to work on capacity and I want people to know in the states that are most impacted by the Coronavirus that we are with you. We’re going to stay with you and we’re going to continue to work around the clock to make sure your courageous healthcare workers, your health systems and your state governments have the resources to support your response. On the subject of testing, Dr. Birx will reflect on what the data is showing in just a moment, not including local labs and hospitals, we are at 432,000 tests completed.
Mike Pence: (45:52)
And we’re pleased to see that there are literally drive through and community sites around the country in the U.S. Public Health Services assisting states in standing those up each and every day. We do remind hospitals and labs around the country, the moment the President signs the bill that it, that it is absolutely essential that they provide the results of the test to us. It gives us visibility into what’s happening on the ground. But because of the public private partnership, President Trump initiated with these vast commercial lab networks around the country, we are adding tens of thousands of tests every single day.
Mike Pence: (46:32)
On the subject of supplies, before the end of the week we’ll talk a bit more as the president did moments ago about the supply chain. I was at FEMA last night and literally saw a room full of people with laptops and cell phones. We are literally leaving no stone unturned as I told governors today to find medical supplies. Whether it be masks or gowns or gloves or ventilators and the team is working around the clock to meet those needs.
Mike Pence: (47:04)
A few smaller items. First and foremost, the CDC is developing guidance, which we’ll be publishing tomorrow about the best way to utilize our natural resources at our parks. It would be several weeks ago that our park service waived all entrance fees and we directed the CDC to produce guidance for how people can still practice social distancing and common sense, but be out of doors and enjoy our natural parks. We’ll also be sharing that guidance with the vast state park systems around the country and encouraging their support with that. Let me, let me last say again. There is nothing more important for the American people to do to slow the spread than to heed your state and local guidance in areas impacted by the Coronavirus and for everyone else to put into practice the 15 days to slow the spread.
Mike Pence: (48:03)
Dr. Fauci will reflect on the importance of mitigation and the impact that we believe that it is having around the country. But it is, people ask me from time to time, “What can I do?” And I say from my heart to every American, this is what you can do, not just to protect your own health and that of your family, but no American wants to inadvertently spread the Coronavirus, particularly to those that may be vulnerable to serious health consequences. Remember that the risk of serious illness to the average American remains low. I mean the vast majority of people that contract the Coronavirus will have mild symptoms to flu like symptoms and and, and will recover. But for seniors with serious underlying health conditions or with people with immuno-deficiencies, everyone needs to practice the principles of 15 days to slow the spread. The President announced this week that we are looking forward to the day that we can open up the country and this team will be bringing him recommendations about how we can safely and responsibly do just that. But for every American that wants to see America back in business, you can hasten the day by putting into practice the 15 days to slow the spread. Go to coronavirus.gov for details and I truly do believe if all of us will do all that we can do, we will slow the spread. We will protect the most vulnerable and we will heal our land. With that, let me recognize Dr. Tony Fauci, to speak about… Oh, Dr. Birx please and then Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (49:41)
Oh, thank you Mr. Vice President and thank you all for listening to us talk to the American people. We’ve been watching the testing results, it’s very critical to us. It’s very to be looking at that very carefully. Let me tell you two things that are going on in parallel. Our system to look at flu like illnesses is still up and running and in county after county and state after state. And why is that important for those who’ve been following the flu epidemic this year? You’ll remember we had Flu A, then we had another peak of Flu B.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (50:14)
And those systems that are in every single state and local government is the platform where we can see whether there’s any increase in flu-like illnesses. So if you have very few cases in your state and in your counties, maintain your flu surveillance system that you work closely with the CDC on. And look for changes in your slope of new flu-like illnesses and there are enough test kits and there’s particularly enough of the CDC test kit where we started that runs on your flu surveillance platform to be constantly surveilling what those flu-like illnesses are in our states and counties that have very low number of cases.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (50:56)
We have counties still with zero to one cases, but they can participate in their surveillance that we need to have out there now by using their flu-like surveillance system and we thank all of the states who have that up and running. If you go to cdc.gov and go to flu surveillance, you can see state by state and you can be looking at those curves with us. It’s what we’re looking at day by day in addition to the testing results that are coming in. For the testing results still on, there’s four counties that constitute the majority of both the current cases and new cases. I think you know those are New York City, Westchester, New York Suffolk and Nassau county. Those are the four counties all associated with New York and the New York Metro area. There’s a few counties in New Jersey, but this is still where 56% of the cases are and 56% of the new cases.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (51:53)
It’s very important that people look at the number of new cases per day. Remember we told you it was going to take us a while to work through the testing backlog? I think we are close to working through the testing backlog so that you can interpret the number of cases per day and you will see in New York City that the number of cases per day has been relatively constant over the last three days. Those are the number of new cases per day. This is a real call to every person in New York City, in the New York Metro area, to continue every one of these 15 days to slow the spread and to do that part of that at the same time that they’re following the mayors and governors piece.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (52:35)
Yesterday we talked about people that may have left the Metro area that were residents, residents of the Metro area that may have gone to secondary homes or other places to reside. And we’ve asked all of them to carefully monitor their temperatures and self-isolate from the communities where they went just to ensure their own health and the health of their communities while people move around the country.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (52:59)
Finally, why this is so important? It’s very important to me personally because my grandmother for 88 years lived with the fact that she was the one at age 11 who brought home flu to her mother named Leah, for which I am named. When her mother had just delivered and her mother succumbed to the great 1918 flu. She never forgot that she was the child that was in school that innocently brought that flu home. This is why we keep saying to every American, you have a role to protect each and every person that you interact with. We have a role to protect one another. It’s why we are social distancing and you are social distancing. But to every American out there, when you are protecting yourself, you’re protecting others. And if you inadvertently, I know, brought this virus home to someone with a preexisting condition, I can tell you my grandmother lived with that for 88 years. So this is what we’re trying. This is the message that’s important to everybody. This is not a theoretic. This is a reality. You can see the number of deaths that are occurring. We all have a role in preventing them, so thank you for the work that you do to get our message out to others. To really ensure that every American understands how important their role is as we move through these next five days to not let up for an instant. I hear some reports that someone said, “Oh well, the new cases in New York are increasing,” or “the hospitalizations are increasing.” The number of new cases over the last three days have been consistent but not rising any more than a consistent day over day rise. You will see hospital cases continue to increase because they are a reflection of what happened one to two weeks ago before the full mitigation efforts were put into place. So each person in every place, no matter what county, what community, what state can work with us to ensure that we prevent the spread of this virus to others. So thank you.
Dr. Fauci: (55:10)
Thank you, Mr. Vice-President. I just want to spend a couple of minutes telling you a little bit about some information that I got on our weekly call that we have at least once a week with the WHO, which is led by Dr. Tedros and Mike Ryan, who is the point man there to give us some information. And in that regard, I want to apologize for my curt response to you when you asked me about the China deal because I shouldn’t have done that. That’s not my style. But what I really wanted to say is that my job is that I’m a scientist. I’m a physician. And I’m a public health person and I don’t like to get involved in that stuff. So anyway, getting back to the WHO. So we learned some really interesting information because obviously the other countries like China and others have had been hit prior that we did.
Dr. Fauci: (55:55)
One of the things that was striking to me, and I just throw it out because it’s something that we will face, we’re not facing it now, but we will face. Our Chinese colleagues are very concerned because they went through the entire cycle of the curve to come down and they have very, very few cases. But what they’re starting to see as they’re relaxing the constraints on travel, that they’re getting imported cases and they wanted to warn us that when we get successful, make sure you very carefully examine how you’re going to release the constraints on inputs.
Dr. Fauci: (56:34)
So I know we’re going to be successful in putting this on the control, but I think we’re going to have to remember, we don’t want to import cases in. That’s the first thing for today. The second thing that was important is that it was something that Dr. Birx mentioned. And that is when you look at the inflection of the curves, we now have multiple different countries that have gone through various phases of their individual outbreaks, and you could learn something from them.
Dr. Fauci: (57:02)
And you could learn something from them about where you are in your own outbreak. For example, when China went up, what happened is they just didn’t turn around. They went from going to, I’ll just take an arbitrary number, 500 new cases a day. The next day it was 1000 cases, then 1500 and then 2000, but once the number of new cases each day starts to flatten out, that’s when you get to that point where the inflection goes down. So, things we want to look for, the things that Dr. Birx had mentioned, that doesn’t mean you declare victory when it does that, but you know you’re at least on the way to where you want to go, and I think that’s really very important.
Dr. Fauci: (57:45)
The third and final thing that I think gets back to the question that many of you in the audience have asked of us is about would this possibly become a seasonal cyclic thing? And I’ve always indicated to you that I think it very well might. And the reason I say that is that what we’re starting to see now in the southern hemisphere, in southern Africa, and in the southern hemisphere countries, is that we’re having cases that are appearing as they go into their winter season, and if in fact they have a substantial outbreak, it will be inevitable that we need to be prepared that we’ll get a cycle around the second time.
Dr. Fauci: (58:25)
What does that mean for us in what we’re doing? It totally emphasizes the need to do what we’re doing in developing a vaccine, testing it quickly, and trying to get it ready so that we’ll have a vaccine available for that next cycle. In addition, to do the randomized controlled trials of drugs, so that we will have a menu of drugs that we have shown to be effective and shown to be safe, because I know we’ll be successful in putting this down now, but we really need to be prepared for another cycle, and what we’re doing I believe will prepare us well. Thank you.
Mike Pence: (58:59)
Thanks, Doc. We’ll take a few questions. Please.
Speaker 4: (59:03)
Mr. Vice President, on ventilators, some really important reporting from the Center of Public Integrity today, they suggested that there’s only 16,000 in the national stockpile. Can you just give us some clarity? How many ventilators do you have in the national stockpile? Who else is making them and how long will it take for them to make a critical mass? Because based on the Center for Public Integrity, it appears there aren’t enough if you live or you die as a result.
Mike Pence: (59:25)
Ventilators has been a singular focus of a good portion of our Supply Chain Stabilization Task Force at FEMA since the President stood up on FEMA’s National Response Center, and we’re making progress in a variety of ways. First, there is the national stockpile which you refer, and depending on what’s been distributed, we just delivered 4,000 ventilators to New York, including ventilators that we sent to New York City, but there’s that number of some 20,000, less than 20,000, I won’t dispute your number. Beyond that, there literally are, by most estimates, more than 150,000 ventilators in the broad healthcare system all across the country. We also, working with anesthesiologists and there was a very important conference call today, we have determined several weeks ago that the devices that anesthesiologists use for outpatient surgery can be converted with the change of a single vent to a very useful ventilator.
Mike Pence: (01:00:35)
I actually spoke to Governor Cuomo about that today. He’s in the process of serving all of his surgical centers, as governors around the country are doing. We literally believe there’s tens of thousands of ventilators that can be converted now that the FDA has given guidance. And Dr. Birx can probably speak to that in a moment. We actually have produced a helpful video to explain how quickly those devices can be converted. But we’re also working with General Motors and other companies to immediately spin up production. Those contracts are being reviewed. We’re vetting their capability.
Mike Pence: (01:01:14)
But one of the other ideas is as we look at areas of the country that are most impacted, and now more than half of the cases for coronavirus are in New York state and in the region around there, but we’ll want to focus our resources, including ventilators, on where communities are struggling the most with coronavirus. And so one of the ways that we’re working through that at FEMA now is by spinning up production and at the same time working with the existing national supply, maybe from areas that don’t have a particular burden yet with the coronavirus, and making sure that we’re manufacturing, backfilling and meeting that need.
Mike Pence: (01:01:56)
But what I can tell you is we’ve got an extraordinary team. Admiral [inaudible 01:02:00] is a two star Navy Admiral who’s doing an incredible job. We literally are identifying resources around the country and around the world. We’re contracting and arranging transportation for those. But maybe, Dr. Birx, you can speak to the ventilator, quickly transition.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:02:19)
Thank you. Thank you, sir. So I just want to thank Dr. Mary Peterson and the whole team of the American Association of Anesthesiologists because they immediately, when we asked them, could these be modified, they went to immediate work on it. They’re going to have Q and A’s up for, but more importantly, every anesthesiologist in every city has been working with their state and local health officials to really work with them how to change this. And I think that it’s not only the ventilators that they’ll be supplying, they have the people that run those ventilators that are not any longer doing elective surgery. So changing that elective surgery piece over a week ago has freed up lot of additional resources.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:02:59)
When I talk to you about how we are, we’ve done some things that are very horizontal across the country, but we’re collecting data now in a county by county granular way. So it’s like any epidemic. It’s not equal everywhere. There are places that are very spared, and there’s places where there’s more. We have a very vast country with a lot of capacity and a lot of infrastructure, and so looking very specifically about where the virus has been, where is it going, who has got freed up resources from where it has been, because it didn’t hit all, it hit Washington state earlier than it hit New York, and looking at all of those pieces to really ensure how we can innovatively move equipment around based on the need. And so I know that it has become a place where people are looking at numbers rather than what is needed.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:03:52)
Because if you do these projections, when you got to those projections that said like in Germany and others, that implied that 60% or 50% of the population would get infected, I want to be very clear. The only way that happens is if this virus remains continuously moving through populations in this cycle, in the fall cycle, and another cycle. So that’s through three cycles with nothing being done. And so we’re dealing with the cycle A right now, not the one that could come in the fall of 2020, or though we’re getting prepared for it by the innovations that are being worked on, and not the 2021, we’re really dealing with the here and now, why we’re planning for the future. And I think the numbers that have been put out there are actually very frightening to people. But I can tell you, if you go back and look at Wuhan and Hubei, and all of these provinces, when they talk about 60,000 people being infected, even if you said, “Oh, right, well there’s asymptomatics,” and all of that, so you get to 600,000 people out of 80 million.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:05:05)
That is no where close to the numbers that you see people putting out there. I think it is frightened the American people. I think on a model that you just run full out, you can get to those numbers if you have zero controls and you do nothing, and we know that every American is doing something. And so I think what our job right now is, is to carefully detail on a hospital by hospital, state by state, county by county, to outline what the infrastructure needs are and ensure that we’re meeting them, both from the stockpile and from the generosity and movement of the American people and other hospitals.
Speaker 4: (01:05:43)
Dr. Birx, a lot of folks out there, well intentioned, are sewing cloth masks and donating them to hospitals. Can you or Dr. Fauci, can you weigh in on that because obviously these people have great intentions, but there’s some mixed feedback on whether that’s a good idea, better than nothing?
Dr. Fauci: (01:05:58)
I’m sorry, what [crosstalk 01:05:58]?
Speaker 4: (01:05:58)
For the surgical masks. People are sewing them, so clothing manufacturers, volunteers dropping them off at hospitals, is that necessary? Is that helpful? Is it something you’d recommend?
Dr. Fauci: (01:06:08)
Well, I mean, you would only recommend that under desperate situations if you don’t have any masks, but what we’re seeing now as you’ve heard, is a rather significant inflow of masks that are coming in that are going to be available. I mean, obviously if you don’t have a mask and you need a mask and it’s appropriate for you to wear it, you do what you can, but I don’t see that now as a necessity given what’s going on right now.
Mike Pence: (01:06:32)
Great. Great. We’ll take a couple more things. Thanks. Go ahead.
Speaker 11: (01:06:35)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We can keep hearing reports of competition among states that are trying to apply this necessary equipment onto a private market. And the Governor of Kentucky said yesterday that his state was in line to buy some equipment, but FEMA came in and purchased it from under them. So he says this is creating a problem for states because on the one hand they’re being told to get the equipment themselves if they can. But on the other hand, the federal government is buying up the supply chain. So is this a problem that you’re hearing about and what is your advice to states like Kentucky that are having this issue?
Mike Pence: (01:07:10)
I actually spoke to the Governor of Michigan today, Governor Whitmer and I, about just that. And we put our FEMA regional representative right on the case. We want to make sure that we’re acquiring every bit as much as we can through FEMA, but as we’ve worked with the supply chain, we want to have full coordination with the states, and of course they’re making in hospitals that they’re making. And we’re looking into those matters.
Mike Pence: (01:07:41)
But make no mistake about it. This FEMA team at the President’s direction is leaning into this effort, leaving no stone unturned, literally searching not just the nation but the world for all of these critical supplies, and as the President just a reported to you, we’re in the process of shipping 9.4 million N95 respirators, 20 million surgical masks, 3.1 million face shields, and the list goes on, and we’re going to be shipping those every single day. But as I told Governor Whitmer today, who’s leading her state through all of this with great energy, we want to partner with her. We want to partner with every governor and make sure that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing in terms of acquiring resources.
Mike Pence: (01:08:29)
[crosstalk 01:08:29] Or, how about you right here.
Speaker 12: (01:08:31)
Thank you so much.
Mike Pence: (01:08:31)
No, right here.
Speaker 13: (01:08:31)
Oh, thank you.
Speaker 12: (01:08:34)
Then can I ask the next one.
Mike Pence: (01:08:35)
Thank you. Go ahead.
Speaker 13: (01:08:36)
On the mask question, healthcare workers on the ground still report that there are mask shortages. What timeline do you predict for making sure everyone who needs a mask is adequately supplied?
Mike Pence: (01:08:50)
Well, I’m going to let Dr. Birx address that as well, but let me say again, I just received a report, we’re going to be detailing it before the end of the week, where we’ve literally identified significant resources, not just around the country but around the world, of the masks that can be used by healthcare workers. But as Dr. Birx said, we are focusing those resources in the areas where health care workers are most exposed to the prospect of contracting the coronavirus. The President’s made it clear from early on, right after seeing the needs of Americans who are struggling with the coronavirus, making sure they have the support that they need on the same level of priority. We want our healthcare workers to have the personal protective equipment to be able to do their job safely and we’re working on that.
Mike Pence: (01:09:48)
I will tell you, I spoke about this today to several governors, not only the Governor of Michigan, but the Governor of Indiana and President Trump and I couldn’t be more grateful the way governors around the country are joining us in calling on businesses to go back to their warehouses and identify industrial masks, N95 masks, that because of the change that President Trump insisted on in the law can now be used by hospital workers. And they’re perfectly acceptable to protect a healthcare worker from the possibility of a respiratory disease.
Mike Pence: (01:10:24)
But we’re calling on and our governors are joining us in calling on every business across America during this time of great challenge, where many businesses are idled, go back to your store houses, identify N95 industrial masks, and as I told our governors today, they can call FEMA, they can call the state healthcare services, or they can just load them up on a flat bed and drive them over to their local hospital. And literally we hear stories in every state in the union of people doing that. And so it’s happening all at the same time and we’ll be detailing the progress we’re making on masks. Anything further, Deb?
Dr. Deborah Birx: (01:11:04)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I just wanted to add one piece and this is really a call to every state out there and every county that has been doing community based testing. The FDA put out new guidance, we talked about it several days ago, that people can do self-testing in the drive through, where you give them the materials to do it in their car, and you pick it up in a biohazard bag. This would free up all of that PPE that you see being utilized in those drive throughs back to the hospitals and back to the clinics that need it the most. We have to move to the new technology. FDA worked tirelessly to get that out there so that it could be sparing of gowns, and gloves, and full respiratory N95s. This is the moment to move to that self-testing front of nose with the new applicators that can be utilized, so that every single bit of the N95s can be put into the hospitals that need it. [crosstalk 01:12:09].
Mike Pence: (01:12:12)
Let me just say, we look forward to seeing you all tomorrow. We’ll be back here with further progress and news. But if I could just say to every American, we’ll get through this. We’ll get through this, but we’ll get through this together. Every American needs to understand that whether you are in an area that’s impacted by the coronavirus, or an area where there’s very few cases, if you do your part to put into practice 15 days to slow the spread, you will do just that. You’ll impact the spread of this coronavirus epidemic in our country. These experts tell me that we can significantly reduce the number of Americans that would be exposed to the coronavirus as every American continues to put these guidelines into practice.
Mike Pence: (01:13:03)
And we just know that with all of the extraordinary effort that’s being done at the federal level by this tremendous team, and all of our agencies, all the great leadership by governors in both parties across the country, with all the incredible and courageous work by healthcare workers, with the cooperation and the prayers of the American people, we will get this done. We will not only slow the spread, we’ll protect the vulnerable, and we’ll heal our land. Thank you all. We’ll see you tomorrow. [Inaudible 01:13:34]"
"Mar 18, 2020",11:27 A.M. EST,"Donald Trump: (19:18)
Thank you very much. I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus. We’ll be invoking the defense production act just in case we need it. In other words, I think you all know what it is and it can do a lot of good things if we need it and we will have it all completed signing it in just a little while. Right after I’m finished with this conference, I’ll be signing it. It’s prepared to go. So we will be invoking the Defense Production Act. Last week I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which is we invoked previously and which activated FEMA National Response Coordination Center, FEMA is fully engaged at the highest levels.
Donald Trump: (20:16)
Today FEMA is activated in every region. We are at level one, level one being the highest level which we will work with and we’ve been working with FEMA. I’ve done a lot of work with FEMA. They’re incredible. It’s always been on hurricanes or tornadoes. There right now in Tennessee, a large group working in Tennessee have been incredible. It was tragic event Alabama last year, also a tornado and then obviously the numerous hurricanes in different locations that were in some cases very devastating and in every case FEMA came through. This is a very different kind of work for FEMA, but they will come through as they always do.
Donald Trump: (21:02)
We have tremendous people, tremendous talent in FEMA. We’re sending upon request the two hospital ships, they’re being prepared right now. They’re massive ships. They’re the big white ships with the red cross on the sides. One is called The Mercy and the other is called The Comfort and they are in tiptop shape. They soon will be. They’re getting ready to come up to New York. I spoke with governor Cuomo about it. He’s excited about it. We haven’t made the final determination as to where it’s going to go on the West coast. The Comfort is located now in San Diego and it’s going to be… We’ll be picking the destination fairly shortly, so those two ships are being prepared to go and they can be launched over the next week or so depending on need.
Donald Trump: (21:56)
Earlier this week, the first clinical trial of the vaccine candidate for the virus began in Washington state, as you probably know. The genetic sequence of the virus was first published in January, but thanks to the unprecedented partnership between the FDA, NIH, and the private sector, we’ve reached human trials for the vaccine just eight weeks later. It’s a record by many, many months. It used to take years to do this and now we did it just in a very short while. That’s the fastest development in history of what we’re doing with regard to the vaccine and making very, very big progress.
Donald Trump: (22:36)
Today I can announce further steps to expand testing capacity. We’re working with several groups to determine if the self swab a much easier process than the current process. That’s a not very nice to do. I can tell you because I did it. But we have a current process that’s a little bit difficult. If you haven’t done. The groups are working on determining if a self swab by an individual is as effective as the other. The others very effective, very accurate but we’re going to see if we can do a self swab which would be a lot more popular. I can tell you that. So and that would be administered also by a health official but it would be a lot easier to do. The fact is that the health professionals would… It would free up a lot. Let me just say the self swab is what it is. It’s a self swab. You do it yourself.
Donald Trump: (23:40)
The other has to be issued by a health professional and it’s something that is quite difficult and we think it’s working out for the self swab. If it would test positive that people would go and they would do what they have to do, but we think that’s probably working out. I’ve asked the FDA to cut through the red tape and reduce regulatory barriers. We are looking at some very exciting things and I’m going to be holding the second news conference either today. We’re going to talk about the FDA. Some things are happening that are quite exciting and we’re going to be doing that either later today or tomorrow, fairly early tomorrow. So we’ll see what happens. But the FDA, my instructions is I’ve been working very, very hard on a number of developments and we’ll be discussing that with you later today or tomorrow.
Donald Trump: (24:35)
This afternoon I’ll be meeting with nurses on the front lines of the battle against the virus. They’re truly American heroes. They want to get it done. They’re incredible people. So we’re going to be meeting with nurses and I actually look forward to that. Very brave. They’re taking a lot of risk and they have done an incredible job and they never complain.
Donald Trump: (24:59)
Today I’m also announcing that the department of housing and urban development is providing immediate relief to renters and homeowners by suspending all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. So we’re working very closely with Dr. Ben Carson and everybody from HUD. Every generation of American has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation.
Donald Trump: (25:23)
In World War II young people in their teenage years volunteered to fight. They wanted to fight so badly because they love our country. Workers refuse to go home and slept in factory floors to keep assembly lines running. The numbers of ships that they built during World War II to this day has never… Nothing like that has ever been equal. They were doing ships literally on a daily basis. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it and to this day nobody seen anything like that. What they were able to do during World War II and now it’s our time. We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we’ll come through together.
Donald Trump: (26:03)
We are all in this together and we’ll come through together. It’s the invisible enemy. That’s always the toughest enemy, the invisible enemy, but we are going to defeat the invisible enemy. I think we’re going to do it even faster than we thought and it will be a complete victory. It’ll be a total victory.
Donald Trump: (26:19)
So we’ll have a second conference, again having to do with the FDA on this. I think it’s going to be potentially a very exciting news conference and we will do it as quickly as we can, so whether it’s today or tomorrow. And I’ll, with that, ask, Mike Pence to say a few words and thank you very much.
Mike Pence: (26:42)
Thank you Mr. President. The White House Coronavirus Task Force met this morning and now that we have cases in all 50 States, we’re continuing to move out on the president’s call to bring the full resources of the federal government, a full partnership with every state and territory, the full power of the American economy to support businesses and families. As the president says to us and everyday, “We’ll do whatever it takes. We’re all in this together.”
Mike Pence: (27:10)
Yesterday, the president met with the tourism industry executives and also had an engaging discussion with all the top companies in our industrial and medical supply chain. Now, the president, as you all are aware, also announced today that by mutual consent the Northern border to Canada will be close to non-essential travel. This does not include essential travel or the transit of goods, but it was through a mutual discussion that took place this morning between the president and Prime Minister Trudeau and the Department of Homeland Security will be effectuating that decision.
Mike Pence: (27:46)
The president spoke with some of the nation’s top business leaders today, again to speak about the supply chain in the country. And for our part, we’re going to be conducting a conference call later today with state and local health officials to renew our ongoing commitment of cooperation and collaboration.
Mike Pence: (28:07)
As the president said last week in signing the Stafford Act, he stood up the National Response Coordination Center and today at the president’s direction, FEMA has gone to Level 1. FEMA’s mission is to support disasters that are locally executed, state managed and federally supported. And tomorrow, the president will be hosting all the nation’s governors from a video conference at FEMA to ensure that they have a full connection to all of the activated regions for FEMA going forward.
Mike Pence: (28:43)
And with regard to testing, I’m pleased to report that we’re increasing the number of tests being performed by the thousands every day thanks to the public private partnership that President Trump forged with commercial laboratories around the country.
Mike Pence: (28:58)
Our health experts tell us to remind every American, it’s important to remember people without symptoms should not get tested. We want to make sure that the supply of testing is there for those that need it most or are symptomatic or in the vulnerable population.
Mike Pence: (29:15)
Dr Deborah Birks, in a moment, will address the progress that we’re making on testing, the infection rate, our recommendations to every America as well as some important new findings about the impact on youth that we’re gaining from data that’s coming in from Europe. That’ll be important to every, every American.
Mike Pence: (29:35)
On the subject of supplies, the president has our task force extremely focused as the president mentioned yesterday, mentioned that he’s invoking the Defense Production Act today. Secretary Esper, in a few moments, will describe the ongoing efforts that the Department of Defense is taking to make medical resources available.
Mike Pence: (29:54)
Secretary Robert Wilkie will announce decisions the VA has made to expand hospital capacity within their system. Also, with regard to medical personnel, at the president’s direction, HHS is issuing a regulation today that will allow all doctors and medical professionals to practice across state lines to meet the needs of hospitals that may arise in adjoining areas.
Mike Pence: (30:18)
In addition to that, we are again today, asking every American and our medical community leaders and hospitals to partner with us in delaying elective procedures across the country in our healthcare system to ensure that medical supplies and medical capacity go where they’re needed most. Seema Verma will describe guidance that CMS will be issuing on that front.
Mike Pence: (30:44)
And finally, just I want to remind every American of the president’s 15-day Guidance to slow the spread. We are grateful for members of the media and the general public that are adhering to these, sharing them with neighbors and friends. All of our experts continue to believe that if every American will do their part and embrace and put into practice these principles that we can significantly limit the reach of the coronavirus in the weeks and months ahead. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (31:13)
Thank you very much. Dr. Birks, please.
Deborah Birx: (31:13)
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. So you know, we continue to look at data every single day. There are concerning reports coming out of France and Italy about some young people getting seriously ill and very seriously ill in the ICUs. We think part of this may be that people heeded the early data coming out of China and coming out of South Korea about the elderly or those with preexisting medical conditions were at particular risk.
Deborah Birx: (31:48)
It may have been that the millennial generation, our largest generation, our future generation that will carry us through for the next multiple decades, there may be disproportional number of infections among that group. And so, even if it’s a rare occurrence, it may be seen more frequently in that group and be evident now. So we’re looking at that information very carefully.
Deborah Birx: (32:14)
We have not seen any significant mortality in the children, but we are concerned about the early reports coming out of Italy and France.
Deborah Birx: (32:25)
So again, I’m going to call on that generation that’s part of that group that brought us innovation, particularly throughout all of their ability to look around corners and skip through games. I always went level by level. I didn’t realize that you could go from level three to level seven. That’s what they’ve taught us. They look for things that we don’t see. We need them to be healthy.
Deborah Birx: (32:49)
So again, I’m not only calling on you to adheed what’s in the guidance, but to really ensure that each and every one of you are protecting each other. And so, we cannot have these large gatherings that continue to occur throughout the country for people who are off work to then be socializing in large groups and spreading the virus. You have the potential then to spread it to someone who does have a condition that none of us knew about and cause them to have a disastrous outcome.
Deborah Birx: (33:17)
Finally, on the testing piece and what we’re learning. I know you know last week and bringing the private sector, I think what has been exciting to me over the last two and a half weeks is to see this administration harness the full capacity of the private sector, understanding that a lot of our solutions that we need to confront this virus rely on the private sector. Bringing the private sector commercial labs was critical into this process. We are now beginning to see that they have spread out in a prioritized way because we asked them to prioritize the regions that were mostly affected. And so, you still may have difficulty getting tests in areas that do not have significant cases. We’ve had them prioritize the regions where we need diagnosis and their diagnostic percent.
Deborah Birx: (34:03)
Remember, I told you South Korea was under 4%, so 96% of people were negative. The last report we’ve seen from the laboratories have about a seven plus percent positivity rate. Still, 93 plus percent or 92% are negative. But I think that’s encouraging to me personally that we’re prioritizing appropriately to those areas that have the greatest need.
Deborah Birx: (34:28)
Today and yesterday, Thermo Fisher pushed out most of their laboratory testing capacity and that will dramatically increase the app platform and the ability to run additional tests in addition to Roche.
Deborah Birx: (34:43)
So I appreciate everybody’s attention to these numbers. I’m excited that we’ve prioritized where the need was the greatest. But again, please follow the guidance and please make sure in every report that you’re putting out that you’re talking about the presidential guidance to actually stop the spread of this virus. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (35:02)
Thank you, Deborah, very much. Mark, please.
Mark Esper: (35:08)
Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. So good afternoon, everyone. And I want to provide an update on DOD’s coronavirus efforts. As we continue to focus on our three priorities, that’s first of all, protecting our personnel and their families, second, safeguarding our national security mission capabilities and third, of course, supporting the administration’s whole of government approach.
Mark Esper: (35:27)
First of all though, I do want to assure the American people that the United States Military remains ready and capable of defending the country and our interests abroad. Now with that, the department is leaning forward in our response to COVID-19. We have issued international and domestic travel restrictions to all DOD personnel and families that should dramatically reduce potential exposure to the virus. Those have been in place for some time now.
Mark Esper: (35:52)
As I announced yesterday, the Department of Defense will make available up to 5,000,000 N95 respirator masks and other personal protective equipment from our own strategic reserves to the Department of Health and Human Services for distribution. The first one million masks will be available immediately. We are also prepared to distribute to HHS up to 2000 operational deployable ventilators for use as needed.
Mark Esper: (36:15)
Yesterday, I was at Fort Dietrich, Maryland, which is probably the military’s premier research institute where I got updated on the incredible work our people are doing as part of the inter agency team to work on vaccines and therapeutics. They are making great progress there.
Mark Esper: (36:29)
We also have announced that we’ve certified our 16th lab or will soon certified our 16th lab to help with processing tests from across the country.
Mark Esper: (36:40)
Additionally, I have directed, as the president mentioned that, the hospital ships, Mercy and Comfort be prepared to deploy to increase the nation’s medical capacity. And we have also alerted a variety of filled and expeditionary hospitals to be prepared to deploy as well as needed based on direction from the commander-in-chief.
Mark Esper: (36:57)
Today, leadership from the Army Corps of Engineers is in New York meeting with Governor Cuomo and his team. I spoke with Governor Cuomo yesterday and other governors. I will be speaking to more in the coming days to make sure that they know what DOD could provide through our system to address their needs.
Mark Esper: (37:13)
In my conversations with governors and members of Congress about DOD’s resources, I’ve made it clear that we will continue to support the administration’s comprehensive efforts and the country every step of the way while ensuring our nation’s security remains the top priority.
Mark Esper: (37:28)
I want to conclude by thanking again, all of our service members and their families who have been affected by this outbreak. They are all great heroes. We are continued to support them throughout this. We are all in this together. Thank you all very much.
Donald Trump: (37:39)
Thank you very much, Mark. Seema, please.
Seema Verma: (37:44)
Thank you. So yesterday the president made a very important announcement about telehealth, and this is allowing our 62 million seniors to be able to get some medical services from the safety of their home, reducing their risk and without any copays. But we’re also making sure that the healthcare system is repaired and that those on the front lines have the support that they need.
Seema Verma: (38:04)
The reality is, the stakes are high and we need to preserve personal protective equipment for those that are on the front lines of this fight. And to that end, we have put out guidelines over the last two weeks to expand the types of masks that can be used in routine care and saving those N95s for the most risky situations.
Seema Verma: (38:22)
Conserving personal protective equipment is also essential to combat the virus. So today, CMS will announce detailed recommendations to further promote this needed conservation, specifically by limiting non-essential elective medical and surgical procedures, including dental procedures.
Seema Verma: (38:43)
We believe that these recommendations will help surgeons, patients, and hospitals prioritize what is essential while leaving the ultimate decision in the hands of state and local health officials and those clinicians who have direct responsibility to their patients. And we urge providers and clinicians and patients to seriously consider these recommendations. They will not only preserve equipment, but it also allows doctors and nurses to help those that are on the front lines. And it’ll protect patients from unnecessary exposure to the virus.
Seema Verma: (39:16)
We fully appreciate that this is going to have a major impact on the healthcare system, but the shared sacrifice is essential to help those that are on the front lines. And I want to thank the medical societies such as the American College of Surgeons and the American Dental Association that took a proactive approach and already posted these recommendations. And we’ve also talked to the American Medical Association and they have fully indicated their support for this recommendation. We now invite the entire healthcare community to join us in this effort. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (39:46)
Thank you very much.
Mike Pence: (39:48)
Robert.
Donald Trump: (39:49)
Robert, please.
Robert Wilkie: (39:51)
Thank you, Mr. President. My instructions from the president were very clear. I was to do everything imaginable as aggressively as possible to protect the nine and a half million veterans who are part of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Robert Wilkie: (40:06)
Last month, we established 19 emergency operations centers across the country and we began to limit the number of visitors who entered our facilities. We were the first system to begin triaging across the country in our 170 hospitals, the entrance of anyone into our facility without being questioned or tested. We expanded those restrictions to those in our 135 community living centers, which have about 7,800 veterans who are in acute, in acute conditions to make sure that they were protected.
Robert Wilkie: (40:45)
We also took the next step and made sure that we limited the dental surgeries that we provided. We’ve cut back by one third the number of routine appointments we have had and we have canceled elective surgeries. These were all part of the president’s directive to be as aggressive in a public health sense as we could be and I think we have set the pace for the entire country.
Robert Wilkie: (41:13)
I will say, we’ve often said that we work the most noble mission in the federal government. Our veterans have been in the toughest spots in the world. They have been put in conditions that are unimaginable to most Americans and they have responded. They have responded clearly. They have responded with passion and also, the 400,000 members of our department who are out there on the front lines.
Robert Wilkie: (41:40)
The last thing I will say is that, you have heard a lot about the fourth mission that VA has. Our first three missions are healthcare, benefits and memorial affairs. Our fourth mission is to support the federal government in times of natural disasters and pandemics. We are the buttress force in case that FEMA or HHS calls upon us to deploy medical professionals across the country to meet crises. We plan for that every day. We are gaming out emergency preparedness scenarios and we stand ready when the president needs us to expand our mission. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (42:15)
Thank you very much, Robert. Thank you. Thank you, all. That’s very nice. Any questions, please?
Group: (42:22)
Mr. President. [crosstalk 00:42:22].
Donald Trump: (42:22)
Go.
Reporter #1: (42:23)
[inaudible 00:42:23] two questions, if I may. Your treasury secretary was on Capitol Hill talking about the potential for what could come and he said that unemployment could skyrocket to 20%. That could rival the Great Depression. Are we looking at potentially historic-
Donald Trump: (42:39)
No. Well, I don’t agree with that.
Reporter #1: (42:39)
… devastation?
Donald Trump: (42:41)
Yeah. No, I don’t agree. That’s a absolute total worst case scenario. But no, we don’t look at that at all.
Reporter #1: (42:47)
Okay. Thank you. And my second question-
Donald Trump: (42:48)
We’re nowhere near it.
Reporter #1: (42:49)
Okay. Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus? There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country. Your own aid, Secretary Azar says he does not use this term. He says, “Ethnicity does not cause the virus.” Why do you keep using this?
Donald Trump: (43:06)
Because it comes from China.
Reporter #1: (43:06)
A lot of people say it’s racist.
Donald Trump: (43:08)
It’s not racist at all. No, not at all. It comes from China, that’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.
Reporter #1: (43:15)
Do you know the concerns about Chinese Americans in this country?
Donald Trump: (43:15)
Yeah, please, John.
Reporter #1: (43:16)
To the aids behind you, are you comfortable with this term?
Donald Trump: (43:19)
I have great love for all of the people from our country. But as you know, China tried to say at one point, maybe they’ve stopped now, that it was caused by American soldiers. That can’t happen. It’s not going to happen, not as long as I’m president. It comes from China. John, please.
John: (43:39)
Two question if I could, Mr. President? First of all, the Defense Procurement Act, you’re invoking it today.
Donald Trump: (43:44)
Yes.
John: (43:44)
Senator Schumer said on the floor a short time ago, that it urgently needs to be put into action to produce medical supplies, particularly ventilators.
Donald Trump: (43:53)
Yep.
John: (43:53)
Do you have some targets that you would like to see immediately spooled up under the act?
Donald Trump: (43:56)
We do have. We have tremendous numbers of ventilators, but there has never been an instance like this where no matter what you have, it’s not enough. That would be the case. It’s being signed. It’s essentially drawn and I’m going to sign it in just a little while. If we need to use it, we’ll be using it at full speed ahead.
John: (44:16)
Right. You said, “It’s urgently needed to be used.” Do you have some targets?
Donald Trump: (44:19)
Well, we’re going to know whether or not urgent, but we will… Yeah, we do have targets. We have targets for certain pieces of equipment. We have targets for masks, you know, the masks, the numbers of masks are incredible. We’ve ordered millions of them, but we need millions more. A thing like this has never been requested. We’ve never had to even think in terms of these numbers, but we need millions of masks and all of that will be ordered. We need respirators. We need, ventilators is a big thing because it’s a complex piece of equipment. So we have a lot of ventilators, but we’re going to be ordering more.
John: (44:51)
And second question, what size will the checks be that will be sent out to Americans?
Donald Trump: (44:55)
To be determined. We’re working with the Senate right now. We’re working with everybody on Capitol Hill. There has been tremendous… There really has been. I mean, with some exceptions obviously because it’s always the way it is. They have been getting along very well, Republicans and Democrats. It’s a nice thing, very bipartisan, and so forth.
John: (45:13)
Would you like to see them more than a thousand dollars?
Donald Trump: (45:15)
Well, we’re going to see. I don’t want to get into that right now, John. We are looking at different numbers. We’re looking at timing. That would be different, splitting the time, splitting the payments. We’re looking at a lot of different things. It hasn’t been determined yet, but it will shortly be determined and people want to go big as opposed… Everybody seems to want to go big and they want to get to the recovery. The big thing we can do is get rid of this horrible, I call it the unseen, the unseen enemy, you call it. There is a thousand different terms for it. It snuck up on us. It did 128 countries, I think. It’s in something like that, very close to that. Think of that, so it spreads violently. It’s a very contagious, very, very contagious virus.
John: (46:01)
Do you consider America to be on a wartime footing in terms of fighting this virus?
Donald Trump: (46:04)
I do. I actually do. I’m looking at it that way because, you know, if it got out of control. The big thing we did was a very early stoppage of people coming in who could be very, very heavily infected. It was a very good move and it was very early, very, very early when most people, including a lot of professionals, they didn’t want us to do it. That really saved a lot of lives. And yeah, I look at it. I view it as a, in a sense, a wartime president. I mean, that’s what we’re fighting. It’s a very tough situation. You have to do things. You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they’ve ever been. We had the best economy we’ve ever had. And then one day, you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy. But, we’re doing it and we’re doing it well. And I’ll tell you, the American people have been incredible, for the most part, they’ve been really incredible. Yeah, please, [Kaitlin 00:20:57].
Kaitlin: (46:58)
I have a question for you and then I have one for Secretary Wilkie as well.
Donald Trump: (47:00)
Sure.
Kaitlin: (47:00)
But I’ll start with you. You just said there are a tremendous number of ventilators that we have, but for weeks hospitals have been warning about a critical shortage that they say we are not prepared for. So why did it take so long to invoke the Defense Production Act?
Donald Trump: (47:13)
Well, you know, hospitals are supposed to have ventilators too. And when we have thousands of ventilators, it sounds like a lot, but this is a very unforeseen thing. Nobody ever thought of these numbers. Nobody ever saw numbers like this, even with regard to testing. Normally, we wouldn’t be doing testing and they decided to do it, very, very hard to ramp up. Now, we’re getting highly sophisticated tests and it’s going very well. But, nobody has ever heard of testing in the kind of quantities that you’re talking about.
Kaitlin: (47:40)
But we knew for weeks we needed more ventilators, so why did it take so long?
Donald Trump: (47:42)
Well, we knew. It depends. It depends on how it goes. Worst case, absolutely, a best case, not at all, so we’re going to have to see where it goes. But we are ordering thousands and thousands of ventilators and they’re complex. You know, these are complex machines. But, we’re ordering them. Does anybody have a, Mike maybe you do, how many do we have?
Kaitlin: (48:04)
Yeah, you said you’d get back to us with those numbers.
Donald Trump: (48:07)
Please. Yeah, please. Do you know the number?
Kaitlin: (48:08)
The exact number?
Mike Pence: (48:09)
We have a specific number of ventilators in the stockpile. It’s in excess of 10,000 and you just heard the announcement from the Department of Defense. They’ll be adding several more thousand to that. But the president, even this morning and yesterday afternoon, speaking with the largest companies in the supply chain in this country, we’re hearing a tremendous spirit among industry leaders who are ready to step in and add to that volume. The stockpiles don’t count all of the ventilators that exist today in the marketplace and in healthcare facilities around the country.
Mike Pence: (48:43)
But, the president has given us a directive to make sure that our stockpile, but just as importantly working with industry leaders that we’re securing the increase in ventilators, the increase in masks, gloves, eye protective care, garments that are all necessary to lean forward and [crosstalk 00:49:02] we’re confident we’ll be able to accomplish that with the incredible cooperation of the supply chain that exists in America today.
Kaitlin: (49:14)
But, we don’t have an exact number for nationwide. How many ventilators do we have?
Donald Trump: (49:14)
We can give you that exact number. We’ll give it to you.
Kaitlin: (49:14)
Okay. [inaudible 00:49:13].
Donald Trump: (49:14)
But we’re ordering a lot more.
Kaitlin: (49:15)
Okay, sir. That’s [crosstalk 00:49:15].
Donald Trump: (49:15)
Yeah, go ahead in the back, yes.
Kaitlin: (49:20)
I have a question for the VA secretary.
Reporter #2: (49:20)
Mr. President, two question.
Kaitlin: (49:20)
I have one question for [crosstalk 00:49:19].
Donald Trump: (49:20)
Yeah, one second. One second, Kaitlin. We’ll do it in a second.
Kaitlin: (49:22)
Okay.
Donald Trump: (49:23)
You’ll be able to do it.
Kaitlin: (49:23)
Okay, it’s important.
Reporter #2: (49:23)
Two questions, Mr. President. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (49:25)
Yes.
Reporter #2: (49:25)
The first one on the Canadian border, what was the tipping point? Friday, we talked about it. Then Monday you said, no one knew. We’re not considering closing the border.
Donald Trump: (49:32)
No, I said not yet. I spoke with the prime minister, Trudeau, a very good relationship obviously between us and our two countries and no tipping point. It’s just that we want to isolate from the standpoint we don’t want people coming into contact because that’s the way we’re going to win this war. That is so important and we both thought it was time.
Donald Trump: (49:53)
Now it’s not affecting trade. It’s non-essential. It’s non-essential crossings. It won’t affect trade at all. And it was just something we thought would be good for both countries. Yes, please. [crosstalk 00:24:04].
Reporter #2: (50:06)
The second question, Mr. President. How can you be sure that trade-
Donald Trump: (50:08)
Go ahead, please.
Reporter #2: (50:09)
… is not going to be a factor of the virus? How can you be sure that trade and everything that’s being shipped from one side, [crosstalk 00:50:14]?
Donald Trump: (50:15)
Well, they’re doing it in a very careful manner. You can only be vigilant and very professional. It’s not pertaining at this moment to trade between the two countries.
Reporter #2: (50:26)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (50:27)
Yeah, please.
Reporter #3: (50:27)
We are hearing that the trillion dollar economic stimulus package could look something like $50 billion for the airlines, $150 billion dollars in loan guarantees for critical sectors in the economy, a $250 billion dollar payment on April 6th directly to individuals, another $250 billion dollar payment on May 18th, again, directly to individuals and as well $300 billion dollars for small business loan guarantees. Is that, in the general sense, of what you’re looking at?
Donald Trump: (50:53)
It could be. It could be. And we’re also playing with a lot of numbers, a lot of very big numbers and a lot of very small numbers, frankly. We want to take care, we have to help everybody. It was nobody’s fault this happened. I mean, some people could say it was somebody’s fault actually, but it was nobody’s fault. And certainly none of these companies that all of a sudden had no passengers in planes and had no passengers on cruise ships and all of the things that have happened. But I will say that, they can’t be blamed for this. And we want to keep those companies vibrant because it’s, there is going to be a comeback very, very quickly as soon as this is solved. And it will be solved. We will win. And there will be a comeback and it’ll take place very quickly.
Reporter #3: (51:36)
[inaudible 00:51:36] $50 billion dollars. There is, give or take, 330 million Americans or, so if you just do the math on that, that’s about $750 a person, a family of four, that would be about $3,000 on average, again, rough, rough map, which is that where this is headed? It’s actually thousands of dollars.
Donald Trump: (51:52)
Well, I don’t want to say that because it’s a moving… Every number that you mentioned, yes, we’ve talked about those numbers. We’re also moving those numbers in both directions, so we’ll let you know. It’s moving along fast.
Donald Trump: (52:03)
What directions, so we’ll let you know. It’s moving along fast. Again, there’s a great bipartisan effort going on that I haven’t really seen before to this extent.
Speaker 5: (52:14)
On the [inaudible 00:52:14] swab that you mentioned at the beginning of this, has the FDA approved that test?
Donald Trump: (52:18)
No. They’re looking at it. It’s down the line, and they’re looking at it very seriously. And I think it would be a great thing, because the others, to use a nice word, it’s very inconvenient. It’s very tough.
Speaker 5: (52:28)
I’ve got a question for you, sir. You tweeted this morning about your approval rating amongst Republicans. You have said that you give yourself a 10 in terms of handling this crisis. How do you reassure Americans at home who don’t trust you to handle a crisis of this magnitude?
Donald Trump: (52:42)
Well, I think we’re doing a really good job. We started off with a termination of the border, the people coming in from China where this all started. That meant I took it very seriously. And when I use the word calm, calm doesn’t mean that I’m not taking it seriously, and we should be calm. We should be extremely calm. But yeah, 95% within the Republican party and over 50%, and, also, we have very great approval numbers. People like the job that we’re doing. And when you compare this to other epidemics, or if you want to use a different term, you can, but within this country, and you look at what’s happened over the years, this is being handled very, very professionally.
Donald Trump: (53:24)
We have the greatest professionals in the world. We’re doing a good job. Nobody’s ever been swamped like this, and nothing’s been so contagious. The level of contagion has been incredible, actually. Nobody’s seen anything quite like this.
Donald Trump: (53:37)
Yeah, Peter, go ahead.
Peter: (53:38)
If I can ask you about the tests, sir, for a second. If federal officials have shipped millions of tests as you and your colleagues have said, why is the federal government says only 59,000 tests been processed to this point. We just heard from the Atlanta public health director saying that they have fewer than 50 test kits for more than 900,000 citizens. Where are the tests?
Donald Trump: (54:01)
I’ll let Mike answer that.
Deborah Birx: (54:04)
So that’s a very critical question, and thank you for asking it. So the test kits that we put out last week through the rapid movement of that meeting that president Trump called less than two weeks ago, that has resulted in bringing our private sector to the table, because the tests and the platform that was out there could only run between four and 12 tests per platform per day. We’ve now moved into platforms that can run basically tens of thousands of tests per day. So yeah, the reason I’m grateful for your question, because it allows me to point out that a course then there was backlog. There were individuals who had been tested who hadn’t had their specimen run because of the slow throughput. It’s now in a high speed platform. So we will see the number of people diagnosed dramatically increase the next four to five days.
Deborah Birx: (55:01)
I know some of you will use that to raise an alarm that we are worse than Italy because of our slope of our curve. To every American out there, it will be five to six days worth of tests being run in 24 to 48 hours. So our curves will not be stable until sometime next week. The reason I talked about Thermofisher yesterday is because their platform is in 2, 000 laboratories. They’re the ones that are putting out the million tests this week that will solve the issue that Atlanta and others have brought up. I wanted to be clear, we prioritize the areas. We do County by County analysis based on those analyses, on what counties had more than 50 cases, we prioritize the test kits we put out, the 400,000. And that’s why we’re seeing a 7% plus positivity rate. We’ll be able to expand that platform and reprioritize based on the accessibility of the other kits.
Peter: (56:06)
Mr. President, perhaps I can follow up. How are non-symptomatic professional athletes getting tests while others are waiting in line and can’t get them? Do the well connected go to the front of the line?
Donald Trump: (56:16)
You’d have to ask them that question. No, I wouldn’t say so, but perhaps that’s been the story of life. That does happen on occasion, and I’ve noticed where some people have been tested fairly quickly. Look, we inherited a very-
Peter: (56:31)
Would you encourage them to defer a test to other?
Donald Trump: (56:34)
Excuse me, excuse me. We inherited a very obsolete system. This was a system that was out of date, obsolete, or it was a system that was never meant to take care of the kind of quantity, the number of people that we’re talking about. Millions and millions of people. If you go back in years past, like even recently with the flu, nobody had tests before. They didn’t test the entire nation to see whether or not they had flu. They got the flu, they got better. Hopefully they got better. That was it. Now all of a sudden, they do this very complex testing.
Donald Trump: (57:05)
What we’ve done is we broke it down. We broken up the system, but it was obsolete and/or you could say it was also a system that just wasn’t meant to handle the kind of volume that you’re talking about. We’ve rebuilt it into a system that, for the future, will be a very good system if you want to go this route. But this was never done before, and I would imagine it will be done in the future, but we built it into a very good system by using private companies, the great private companies. And I have to say Roche has been doing a very good job. They’re doing a lot of work, a very good job.
Donald Trump: (57:36)
But this was an obsolete system. This was not a system that was meant to do anything like this or even near this.
Donald Trump: (57:42)
John?
John: (57:43)
Mr. President, a couple things. A major train coalition is calling on you to suspend tariffs with other countries as part of the response to the coronavirus.
Donald Trump: (57:53)
Who heads that group? Those countries do, probably. Go check.
John: (57:57)
It’s an American free trade.
Donald Trump: (57:58)
I know, I’m sure of free trade… Look, China’s paying us billions and billions of dollars in tariffs, and there’s no reason to do that. They haven’t even spoken to me about that. China hasn’t asked me to do that, but we’re getting billions of dollars a year from tariffs from China, and I can’t imagine Americans asking for that. But it could be that China will ask for a suspension or something. We’ll see what happens. China’s having a very rough time. They have their worst year in 76 years as I understand it. They’re having a very, very tough time. And then on top of it, this happened with the virus.
Donald Trump: (58:31)
But no, we’re taking in billions of dollars a year in tariffs. And this was caused by something totally unrelated to tariffs.
John: (58:39)
On asylum seekers and people who crossed the Southern border illegally, are you planning to invoke 42 U.S.C. 265, which would allow you to prohibit entry of certain people?
Donald Trump: (58:51)
The answer is yes.
John: (58:53)
When will that happen?
Donald Trump: (58:53)
Very soon. Probably today, yes.
Speaker 7: (58:57)
[crosstalk 00:58:57] question for Dr. Birx. On the border, firstly, are there plans to fully shut the Mexican border, and what do you define as essential travel when it comes to the U.S. Canadian border?
Donald Trump: (59:06)
Well, I think essential is medical. We have military working together. We have industry working together. And again, it’s not affecting trade. So things like that, but just leisurely, let’s go to a restaurant and have dinner, which a lot of people do. They come both ways. They go in both directions, that kind of thing, we have ended on a temporary basis. Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 7: (59:28)
Are you planning to close the Southern border?
Donald Trump: (59:29)
Not close it. No, we’re not going to close it, but we are invoking a certain provision that will allow us great latitude as to what we do.
Donald Trump: (59:38)
Please.
Speaker 7: (59:38)
May I ask her questions if I could?
Donald Trump: (59:40)
Yeah, go ahead. You know what? Go ahead. Sure.
Donald Trump: (59:41)
Doctor.
Speaker 7: (59:43)
So trying to clarify something, because just a week ago, you all were standing here telling us that unless you had sustained contact with somebody who is symptomatic for COVID 19, you really didn’t need to worry. You told the president, the vice president, that if they shook hands with somebody who had this, if they took a photograph with somebody who had this, he didn’t really need to worry, and yet, several days later, we’re in a situation where people are being told, “Don’t leave your houses.” There are curfew saying, “You can not walk alone at night after a certain time.” Can you walk us through what seems like a very dramatic swing, a very dramatic disconnect from what we were hearing before to what we’re hearing now.
Deborah Birx: (01:00:17)
So two things. We look at data all the time, and I know you’re looking at the China and South Korea data. And when you look at China and South Korea data and you look what China and South Korea did, you could see that their curves are not only blunted outside of Wuhan, so the Chinese areas outside of Wuhan blunted curve and South Korea blunted curve. If you look at their curve today, they’re already on the far end of their epidemic curve. Of course, none of those countries are fully back to work. And so that’s what we worry about, too.
Deborah Birx: (01:00:52)
Secondly, there was a series of scientific articles published, and I know you’ve seen them, too, about surface contamination. I think none of us really understood the level of surface piece. So we’re still working out how much is it by human-human transmission and how much is it by surface. And this is why those fundamental guidelines were put out that that says, “Don’t expose yourself to surfaces outside the home.”
Deborah Birx: (01:01:18)
Basically, what those guidelines are is don’t expose yourself to excess number of persons who could be asymptomatic and infected and then the person to person contact, and don’t expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it, for which on hard surfaces, I know we had the cardboard issue about shipping, hard surfaces, not shown in fabric as much or in cardboard, but hard surface transmission. These are issues that we haven’t had to deal with before with the level of respiratory infections, and that’s why we have this concern, and that’s why the president put out the guidelines. And so it’s to cover both of those pieces. That’s all new science, all new models. I think many of you have the imperial study available and looked at the impact of those. That’s the first time those have been modeled as a comprehensive approach to mitigating an epidemic.
Donald Trump: (01:02:10)
Go ahead.
Jennifer: (01:02:14)
Mr. President, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that the administration would look into executive order that would expand the use of investigational drugs against the virus, but the FDA scientists are warning that this could put patients at risk. It’s something you’re looking at?
Donald Trump: (01:02:29)
No, I haven’t seen the article. We are making a lot of progress therapeutically. I will say that, but I have not seen that article, no.
Donald Trump: (01:02:36)
Go ahead.
Speaker 8: (01:02:39)
Mr. President, we’ve shut down non essential travel to Canada. Are you considering shutting down all travel to brunt the spread of the virus, and we’ve heard from industries like the airlines who are seeking relief. What other industries, or how exactly is your administration going to determine which industries and businesses get the help they need?
Donald Trump: (01:03:02)
There were certain industries that people know. The airlines would be number one if you look at what’s going on. They go from having the best year they’ve ever had to having no passengers because of what we’ve had to do in order to win this war. It’s a war, and so basically, you know what many of the industries are. What we want to do is we want to make sure they all stay together so that after the war is won, we can immediately go right back up to where we were and even beyond. I think we’re going to go beyond where we were, and a lot of people are saying that by the way. We’re poised to do that, but we have to win the war first.
Donald Trump: (01:03:34)
Yeah, please go ahead.
Speaker 9: (01:03:35)
Thank you. To follow up on that, treasury proposed $150 billion dollars today for those industries, but their proposal doesn’t detail which industries would get that money and how much. So aside from the airlines, which you just mentioned, what about the cruise industry, the hotels? How much of that money do you see them each year?
Donald Trump: (01:03:52)
We’re talking about all of it. Haven’t detailed it yet. We have detailed it to senators and to members of the House. We have been talking about it, and we’re coming up with numbers. Haven’t gotten there yet, but certainly hotel industry, the cruise ship industry, the airlines. Those are all prime candidates. Absolutely.
Speaker 9: (01:04:11)
On the Northern border, sir-
Donald Trump: (01:04:13)
Which border?
Speaker 9: (01:04:14)
The Northern border. When you say temporary, which is what you said in your tweet, does that mean it’s 30 days?
Donald Trump: (01:04:20)
I would say 30 days, and hopefully at the end of 30 days, we’ll be in great shape.
Donald Trump: (01:04:25)
Jeff, please.
Jeff: (01:04:27)
Mr. President, I was struck by what Dr. Birx said about millennials and others perhaps not taking some of these warnings as seriously as you would like. Some of those people also seem to be your supporters and conservatives who may be quoting some of what you said at the beginning of this, comparing it to the flu. What is your message to them to really follow what you’ve been saying so far, and are you concerned that they’re still listening maybe to some of your earlier comments rather than your more recent ones?
Donald Trump: (01:04:54)
Well, I think my earlier comments are to be calm. I do want people to be calm, because we’re going to win this. And we’re going to win it, it’s just a question of time ,and I want it to go quickly. So based on the fact that I want it to go quickly, I hope they just listened to what we’ve been saying over the last period of time. We don’t want them gathering. And I see they do gather, including on beaches and including in restaurants, young people. They don’t realize. They are feeling invincible. I don’t know if you felt invincible when you were very young, but they were feeling totally invincible, or are feeling that way, but they don’t realize that they can be carrying lots of bad things home to grandmother and grandfather and even their parents. So we want them to heed the advice. We made the advice, and I think it’s getting through. I do believe it’s getting through.
Donald Trump: (01:05:39)
Jim, please.
Peter: (01:05:39)
And what do you say to them if they’re watching?
Donald Trump: (01:05:41)
If they’re what?
Peter: (01:05:43)
I think there are a lot of them watching. A lot of these people at home, these young people.
Donald Trump: (01:05:45)
Well I think I just said it.
Peter: (01:05:46)
I was going to say what do you say to them?
Donald Trump: (01:05:48)
Heed the advice. I just said. Yeah, thank you. Thank you, Peter.
Speaker 8: (01:05:59)
Thank you, Mr. President. In talking about China, you’ve been very clear about who you think is to blame or where the origin to blame for this virus is.
Donald Trump: (01:06:06)
Not think. No, no, I don’t think, I know where it came from. I don’t know if you’d say China’s to blame. Certainly, we didn’t get an early run on it. It would have been helpful if we knew about it earlier, but it comes from China, and it’s not a question about that. Nobody’s questioning that.
Speaker 9: (01:06:22)
So Senator Cotton is saying that they should be punished, in so many words, for inflicting this on the American people. Do you feel that way about it?
Donald Trump: (01:06:32)
Well, I have a lot of respect for Tom Cotton, and I know exactly what he’s been saying. And there are those people that say that. So we’ll see what happens. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:06:41)
[crosstalk 00:14:41].
Donald Trump: (01:06:41)
It’s your turn. Go ahead.
Donald Trump: (01:06:43)
[crosstalk 00:14:45].
Donald Trump: (01:06:43)
Please. He’s been waiting a long time, please. You’ve had your hand up so nicely for a long. It’s your time.
Speaker 10: (01:06:51)
Thank you sir. We’ve seen the Chinese government kick out reporters from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Washington Post. What is your message to the Chinese when it comes to transparency at a moment when you still have reporters asking you questions here at the White House?
Donald Trump: (01:07:05)
Yeah, I’m not happy to see it. I have my own disputes with all three of those media groups. I think you know that very well, but I don’t like seeing that at all. I’m not happy about that at all.
Donald Trump: (01:07:19)
Yes, please.
Speaker 8: (01:07:19)
I wonder if you agree with it. Do you believe that China is inflicting this upon our country?
Donald Trump: (01:07:25)
No, I don’t believe they’re inflicting. I think they could have given us a lot earlier notice, absolutely. Please.
Speaker 6: (01:07:33)
Yeah, Mr. President, your credibility ratings are very low. There was a recent NPR poll-
Donald Trump: (01:07:39)
Who are you asking of that question, because I see that they’re very high. If you look, I’m 95% of the Republican party. We just had a poll that was done by a very reputable group. We’re beating sleepy Joe Biden by a lot in Florida, the state of Florida, and in other states. So I don’t really know who you’re talking about.
Donald Trump: (01:08:02)
Jennifer, go ahead, please. Please.
Jennifer: (01:08:03)
I have two questions if you’re willing to. Would you give us an update on your conversation with the airline executives? Did you explain to them what’s coming? What was their reaction?
Donald Trump: (01:08:12)
I did, and they explained to me where they’re coming from. They went from, as I said, full planes packed, the best year they’ve ever had by far to, boom, one day empty because of what we have to do to win this war, or we would have a level of death like people haven’t seen before. So they’ve been fantastic. They’ve been great, but they went from being extremely happy to being people that are running companies that are going to need some help, and we’ll help them, Jennifer.
Jennifer: (01:08:45)
On SBA laws, would you be willing to give us an update on how that’s going? We’ve been getting some reports that counties have been having difficulty getting [crosstalk 01:08:54].
Donald Trump: (01:08:53)
It’s going. There’s a lot of influx to those loans, as you could imagine. A lot of people are looking at it, but we’re going to be increasing funding a lot, and they’re very well prepared to do what they have to do. And the SBA is doing a fantastic job. She is doing a really good job, the administrator.
Donald Trump: (01:09:08)
John?
John: (01:09:10)
Questions for Dr. Birx, if I could? Dr. Birx, French researchers have had some luck with hydroxychloroquine in shortening the duration of disease. Is that something that might be in the arsenal therapeutics here in the United States?
Deborah Birx: (01:09:25)
I think we are exploring every one of those issues. The president asked for a critical briefing on that today. He opened with that. It is more than that single drug. There are other drugs that individuals are looking at. Just to go back to what we talked about many times, there is things that look really good in cell culture against the virus that may look good in small animals, and then don’t have an impact in humans. And so those are the pieces that we’re looking at very carefully. Of course, there’s always anecdotal reports, and we’re trying to figure out how many anecdotals reports equal real scientific breakthroughs.
John: (01:10:03)
Second question, are you confident of the seasonality of Coronavirus?
Deborah Birx: (01:10:09)
All we can do is look at the past to inform the future. We know what SARS looked like. We also know, and I just want to put this out, I know you can get it online, look at the curve in China and look at the curve in South Korea. Those curves were accomplished in still the winter season. And so we’re trying to understand what those relationships are. We’re very interested in the curves in Italy because of their different approach and we’re following every single country’s curves. And so all we can do is look at prior Coronavirus and prior respiratory infection, RNA viruses. These are RNA viruses. When you look at flu in the Northern hemisphere, when you look at parainfluenza and some of the other cold viruses, and if you look at SARS, that’s the way the peak normally occurs, but that is a November to April. We all started later. And so you’re asking me to predict based on a later start, and that’s what we’re trying to really look at china and South Korea to really inform that.
Donald Trump: (01:11:19)
[Katelyn 00:01:11:22], go ahead.
Katelyn: (01:11:20)
A question for Secretary Wilkie, if you don’t mind, or you can answer if you’d like. How many veterans of those that you need to be tested have been tested?
Robert Wilkie: (01:11:27)
Those that have needed to be tested, we believe we’ve caught most of them. Right now, we have 44 veterans who have tested positive. Sadly, one has passed in Portland. We are working with state labs and private companies to make sure that testing is available. Because the president had us out aggressively early, we have been in a better place than most healthcare systems in the country. I cannot predict this. Dr. Birx said when the next surge will be, if it will be, but one of the things that we do at VA is that we prepare for national emergencies, be the national disasters or epidemics. We started preparing for this. We started stockpiling equipment. Our equipment is stable, and I think that’s in large part because of the instructions the president gave me.
Katelyn: (01:12:23)
But do you have a number of how many have been tested out of the number that you said we tested?
Robert Wilkie: (01:12:27)
We tested several hundred. I can’t give you the direct-
Katelyn: (01:12:29)
It was 200 the other day. Is it higher than that?
Robert Wilkie: (01:12:30)
We’ve tested several hundred. Yes. We’ve tested several hundred. I don’t know exactly. I do know that 44 veterans have the virus. Most of those are quarantined at home.
Donald Trump: (01:12:45)
Go ahead in the back, please.
Speaker 11: (01:12:45)
Thank you, Mr. President. The question for Dr. Birx, quickly. I’m trying to understand what we… It’s about the mortality rate. Yesterday, we underlined the fact that we had reached a hundred deaths, and this morning we wake up and we’re at 110. Within 12 hours, we climbed by 10%. is it something we have to expect from now on, a 10% increase every 12 hours?
Deborah Birx: (01:13:12)
So very early on in each one of these cases, if you look at all of the countries to date, the mortality is higher at the beginning because you’re diagnosing the sickest, the ones who came in quite ill. And I just want to remind the American public that the risk for serious illness in the majority of Americans are low, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t transmit it to one of those higher risk groups. And that’s why we’re asking for all Americans to take responsibility. You’re seeing mortality or deaths today from infections that occurred two to three weeks ago in general. The other thing that you’re seeing is the dramatic and very difficult impact of this virus in nursing homes. And that’s why very early on, the president and vice president had us come out, and CMS put those very strict rules in place, and everybody thought we were being too strict in keeping loved ones away from their family in nursing homes. If we’re going to solve this with a lower death rate, we have to protect the elderly because of their percent is much higher in mortality than any other age group.
Donald Trump: (01:14:25)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 8: (01:14:26)
Mr. President, there’s reporting that the federal government has a plan that shows that this Coronavirus outbreak might last as long as 18 months. Are you seeing those numbers? Could this actually last-
Donald Trump: (01:14:37)
No, we’re not seeing that at all.
Speaker 8: (01:14:39)
And then my second question is there are some, at least one, White House official who used the term Kung flu, referring to the fact that this virus started in China. Is that acceptable? Is it wrong? Are you worried that having this virus be talked about as a Chinese virus, that that might-
Donald Trump: (01:14:54)
I wonder who said that. You know who said that?
Speaker 8: (01:14:57)
I’m not sure the person’s name, but would you condemn the fact, the Kung flu?
Donald Trump: (01:15:00)
Say the term again.
Speaker 8: (01:15:02)
A person at the White House used the term Kung flu. My question is do you think that’s wrong, Kung flu? And do you think using the term Chinese virus, that puts Asian-Americans at risk, that people might target them?
Donald Trump: (01:15:15)
No. No, no. I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There’s nothing not to agree.
Donald Trump: (01:15:22)
How about last question, please? Please, go ahead.
Speaker 13: (01:15:26)
Switching gears to a larger question here. We’ve seen that before the pandemic, there were a lot of Americans that were already alienated. We saw deaths of despair increasing through suicide and other things. Now, as these individuals, a lot of times they’re in rural parts of the country, are self isolating. What is your message to those individuals and what do you hope the individuals, communities and churches will do to reach out to them?
Donald Trump: (01:15:48)
My message is to all Americans, but to those Americans who are going through a lot, we love them. We’re with them and we will not let them down. Thank you all very much.
Speaker 13: (01:16:03)
Mr. Vice President, do you agree with the term Chinese virus?
Speaker 8: (01:16:10)
Dr. Birx, do you believe this is a Chinese virus? Is that okay to say?"
"Mar 16, 2020","19 years, going on 20 years.","Donald Trump: (09:24)
I’m glad to see that you’re practicing social distancing. That looks very nice. That’s very good. I want to thank everybody for being here today. This morning I spoke with the leaders of the G seven, G seven nations and they really had a good meeting. I think it was a very, very productive meeting. I also spoke with our nation’s governors, and this afternoon we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days. As we combat the virus, each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus. We did this today. This was done by a lot of very talented people, some of whom were standing with me, and that’s available.
Donald Trump: (10:16)
Dr. Birx will be speaking about that in just a few minutes. It’s important for the young and healthy people to understand that while they may experience milder symptoms, they can easily spread this virus and they will spread it indeed, putting countless others in harm’s way. We especially worry about our senior citizens. The White House task force meets every day and continually updates guidelines based on the fast evolving situation that this has become all over the world. It’s all over the world. It’s incredible what’s happened in such a short period of time. On the guidelines of the task force, the new modeling conducted by Dr. Birx and our consultation with governors, we’ve made the decision to further toughen the guidelines and blunt the infection now. We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it and that’s what we are. Therefore, my administration is recommending that all Americans, including the young and healthy, work to engage in schooling from home when possible, avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people.
Donald Trump: (11:21)
Avoid discretionary travel and avoid eating and drinking at bars, restaurants, and public food courts. If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration altogether. With several weeks of focused action, we can turn the corner and turn it quickly and a lot of progress has been made. I’m also pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history, not even close. We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments and we’ve had some promising results, early results, but promising to reduce the severity and the duration of the symptoms. And I have to say that our government is prepared to do whatever it takes, whatever it takes we’re doing, and we’re doing it in every way. And with that I’d like to just introduce Dr. Birx, Who’s going to discuss some of the things that we strongly recommend. Thank you.
Dr. Birx: (12:35)
Thank you, Mr. President. I think you know, over the last months we’ve taken very bold action to stop the virus from coming to our shores. And because of that, we gained time to really get together and understand the progress across the globe of what has worked and what hasn’t worked. We now need to appeal to every single American so that they can have their role in stopping the spread of this virus. We’ve talked about things before about washing your hands, but we really want to focus on if you are sick, no matter who you are, please stay home. If someone in your household is diagnosed with this virus, the entire household should quarantine in the house to prevent spread of the virus to others. The reason we’re taking these strong and bold steps is because we know there is virus spread before you develop symptoms, and then we know that there’s a large group, we don’t know the precise percent yet that actually is asymptomatic or has such mild cases that they continue to spread the virus.
Dr. Birx: (13:45)
If your children are sick, please keep them home. Now, to our older population or those with preexisting medical conditions. Everyone in the household needs to focus on protecting them. Everyone in the household. I want to speak particularly to our largest generation now, our millennials. I am the mom of two wonderful millennial young women who are bright and hardworking and I will tell you what I told to them. They are the core group that will stop this virus. They are the group that communicates successfully, independent of picking up a phone. They intuitively know how to contact each others without being in large social gatherings. We’re asking all of them to hold their gatherings to under 10 people. Not just in bars and restaurants, but in homes.
Dr. Birx: (14:40)
We really want people to be separated at this time, to be able to address this virus as comprehensively that we cannot see, for we don’t have a vaccine or a therapeutic. The only thing we have right now is the amazing ingenuity and compassion of the American people. We’re appealing to all Americans to take these steps to protect each other and to ensure that the virus doesn’t spread. These guidelines are very specific. They’re very detailed. They will only work if every American takes this together to heart and responds as one nation and one people to stop the spread of this virus. Thank you.
Dr. Fauci: (15:25)
Thank you very much Dr. Birx. So just to connect with what I mentioned to you in previous discussions in this room, and Dr. Birx said it very well. That in order to be able to contain and curtail this epidemic to not reach its maximum capability, we have a two pillar approach. One of which I believe has been very effective in preventing the substantial seating and namely the travel restrictions that we’ve discussed many times in this room. The other equally, if not more important is when you have infection in your own country, which we do, and I can read the numbers, but they’re really essentially what we’ve seen yesterday. Incremental increases both globally as well as in the United States, but the curve doing that. So therefore the kinds of things that we do are containment and mitigation. This what we’re mentioning now, the guidelines when you look at them carefully, I believe if the people in the United States take them seriously because they were based on some rather serious consideration back and forth, some may look at them and say they’re going to be really inconvenient for people.
Dr. Fauci: (16:44)
Some will look and say, well, maybe we’ve gone a little bit too far. They were well thought out, and the thing that I want to reemphasize, and I will say it over and over again, when you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak, you are always behind where you think you are if you think that today reflects where you really are. That’s not word speak. It means if you think you’re here, you’re really here because you’re only getting the results. Therefore it will always seem that the best way to address it would to be doing something that looks like it might be an overreaction. It isn’t an overreaction. It’s a reaction that we feel is commensurate, which is actually going on in reality. So take a look at the guidelines, read them carefully and we hope that the people of the United States will take them very seriously because they will fail if people don’t adhere to them. We have to have, as a whole country, cooperate and to make sure these get done. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (17:53)
Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: (17:54)
[crosstalk 00:17:55]. Mr. President, a lot of people are concerned about how long all of this might last. Do you have any kind of estimate that if Americans really were to band together and do what the White House is suggesting, how quickly you could turn this corner?
Donald Trump: (18:09)
My favorite question, I ask it all the time, how many times Anthony? I think I ask him that question every day and I speak to Debra, I speak to a lot of them. I get the opinion. So it seems to me that if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that is a much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August, something like that. So it could be right in that period of time where I say it washes through, other people don’t like that term, but it washes through.
Speaker 1: (18:50)
Is the new normal until the height of the summer?
Donald Trump: (18:53)
We’ll see what happens. But they think August, could be July. It could be longer than that. But I’ve asked that question many, many times. Yes?
Speaker 2: (19:00)
With that being said, Mr. President, Americans today and looking forward are living with so much anxiety and so much fear facing uncertainty right now. I’m curious, how are you talking to your own family about this? How are you talking to your youngest son? Do you empathize with this sense of anxiety? People are really scared.
Donald Trump: (19:20)
I think they are very scared. I think they see that we’re doing a very professional job. We’ve been working with the governors and the frankly, the mayors, local government at every level. We have FEMA totally involved. FEMA has been … Usually we see FEMA for the hurricanes and the tornadoes. Now we have FEMA involved in this. They’ve been doing a fantastic job locally, working with people that they know because they work, like as an example, in California, in the state of Washington, they work with them a lot on other things and they’re very familiar, so they’re working on it. What you can do and all you can do is professional, totally competent. We have the best people in the world. We have really the greatest experts in the world and someday soon hopefully it’ll end and we’ll be back to where it was, but this came up … We came up so suddenly look, you were surprised. We were all surprised. We heard about it.
Donald Trump: (20:14)
We heard about reports from China that something was happening and all of a sudden we did make a good decision. We closed our borders to China very quickly, very rapidly. That was … Otherwise we’d be in a very, as Tony has said numerous times, we’d be in a very bad position, much worse than we would be right now. You’re looking at what’s happening in other countries. Italy is having a very hard time, but I think that what we do, and I’ve spoken actually with my son, he says, “How bad is this?” It’s bad. It’s bad, but we’re going to, we’re going to be hopefully a case not a worst case and that’s what we’re working for. Yes?
Speaker 3: (20:49)
You can clear up some confusion on two key fronts. One is about your own tests. The other was about containment efforts. Is the administration considering more aggressive containment options like a quarantine, a national curfew [crosstalk 00:21:03]?
Donald Trump: (21:03)
Well, we have that very much. Yeah, we have that very much and we are … We’ve been pretty aggressive. We were early with Europe but we were very, very early with China and other places and fortunately we were. And as far as containment here, we are. We’re coming out with strong suggestions and it’s becoming a little bit automatic. You look at people, they’re not doing certain things. For instance, obviously not … I wouldn’t say the restaurant business is booming and bars and grills and all. People are self- containing for to a large extent. We look forward to the day when we can get back to normal. What’s your second question?
Speaker 1: (21:38)
Are you considering instituting a nationwide lockdown, a nationwide quarantine? The NSC knocked that down, but there’s still some questions about how it all [crosstalk 00:21:47].
Donald Trump: (21:46)
At this point, not nationwide, but, well, there was some point … Some places in our nation that are not very effected at all, but we may look at certain areas, certain hotspots, as they call them. We’ll be looking at that, but at this moment, no, we’re not.
Donald Trump: (22:03)
… call them. We’ll be looking at that. But at this moment, no, we’re not.
Speaker 4: (22:03)
The second question is you said you had your coronavirus test Friday night. The White House doctor’s office put out a statement around midnight Friday saying that no test was indicated. When exactly was your test administered to you?
Donald Trump: (22:14)
I had my test. It was late Friday night. The reason I did it was because the … I had no symptoms whatsoever. The doctor said, “You have no symptoms so we don’t see any reason.” But when I did the press conference on Friday, everybody was going crazy. “Did you do the test? Did you do the test?” Very late on Friday night I did the test. The doctor may have put out something. I don’t know what time the letter went out. Maybe it was put out by somebody else, but the results came back I believe the following day. We tested negative.
Speaker 4: (22:47)
But the question is, how could the White House doctor’s office say a test wasn’t indicated implying that you hadn’t had one when in fact you had tested?
Donald Trump: (22:53)
I told them that and I went totally by what they said, the doctors, more than one. They said you don’t have any of the symptoms. They checked what you’re supposed to check and that I didn’t have symptoms, but I did a test late on Friday night. It came back probably 24 hours later or something. They sent it to the labs. It came back later. Yeah, please.
Speaker 5: (23:13)
Mr. President, you had a teleconference with the nation’s governors today. In that teleconference you told them if they need things like respirators or masks to try to get it on their own. What did you mean by that? What will the federal government do to help them?
Donald Trump: (23:25)
If they can get them faster by getting them on their own, in other words, go through a supply chain that they may have. Because the governors during normal times, the governors buy a lot of things, not necessarily through federal government. If they’re able to get ventilators, respirators, if they’re able to get certain things without having to go through the longer process of federal government.
Donald Trump: (23:45)
We have stockpiles now where we’re ordering tremendous numbers of ventilators, respirators, masks, and they’re ordered. They’re coming. We have quite a few at this point. I think, Mike, we have a lot. But if they can get them directly, it’s always going to be faster if they could get them directly if they need them. I’ve given them authorization to order directly.
Speaker 6: (24:07)
Mr. President, one of the big weaknesses in our healthcare system is surge capacity for medical facilities.
Donald Trump: (24:15)
That’s right.
Speaker 6: (24:15)
I wanted to ask what precautions, what planning is being done to get … China was able to build hospitals in a matter of days. Are you prepared to use the Corps of Engineers or FEMA to start building the surge capacity that we may need in a couple of weeks?
Donald Trump: (24:33)
First of all, we hope we don’t get there. That’s what we’re doing. That’s why we’re taking a very strict look at this. But we also are looking at areas and not only looking, we’re expanding certain areas. We’re taking over buildings that aren’t used. We’re doing a lot in that regard. We hope we don’t have to get there, but we are doing a lot in that regard.
Speaker 7: (24:52)
Mr. President, can you clarify something? These guidelines say, “Stay home if you’re sick.” Yesterday the Vice President said, “No one should worry about losing a paycheck if they stay home when they’re sick.” But the House bill exempts companies of 500 employees or more from the paid sick leave requirement. That’s 54% of the American workplace. Why is it a good idea to only require small businesses to provide paid sick leave?
Donald Trump: (25:16)
We’re looking at that and we may be expanding that. We are looking at that.
Speaker 7: (25:19)
Do you then want to add big companies?
Donald Trump: (25:19)
We want fairness. We want it for everybody. No, we’re looking at that through the Senate, because as you know the Senate is now digesting that bill.
Speaker 7: (25:26)
Do you then want them to add big companies?
Donald Trump: (25:26)
We may very well be adding something on that. Good question.
Speaker 8: (25:29)
Two questions here, Mr. President. One going off of what he was asking. How many ventilators and how many ICU beds do we have right now and will it be enough?
Donald Trump: (25:38)
I could get back to you with that number. We’ve ordered a lot. We have quite a few, but it may not be enough. If it’s not enough, we will have it by the time we need it. Hopefully we won’t need them.
Speaker 8: (25:47)
And you’ll give us the exact number?
Donald Trump: (25:48)
Yeah, we’ll be able to give you-
Speaker 8: (25:51)
Because so far they have not given us an exact number.
Donald Trump: (25:51)
We can give you a number. If it’s important, we’ll give you a number. Go ahead.
Speaker 8: (25:53)
Yesterday you said that this was, “Under tremendous control.” Do you want to revisit that statement if we are going to be experiencing this until July or August, five more months ahead of right where we are now?
Donald Trump: (26:05)
When I’m talking about control, I’m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we’re dealing with. We’re doing a very good job. There’s been a tremendous amount of the way they’re working together. They’re working hand-in-hand. I think they’re doing really a great job. From that standpoint, that’s what I was referring to yesterday. Yeah, Steve, go ahead.
Speaker 8: (26:26)
You not saying, “It’s under control,” right?
Donald Trump: (26:27)
I’m not referring to it. Meaning the-
Speaker 8: (26:30)
Coronavirus.
Donald Trump: (26:30)
Yeah, if you’re talking about the virus, no. That’s not under control for any place in the world. I think I read-
Speaker 8: (26:35)
Yesterday you had said it was.
Donald Trump: (26:35)
I think I read … no, I didn’t. I was talking about what we’re doing is under control, but I’m not talking about the virus.
Donald Trump: (26:40)
Yes, please.
Steve: (26:41)
The stock market took another hit today. Is the US economy heading into a recession?
Donald Trump: (26:46)
Well, it may be. We’re not thinking in terms of recession. We’re thinking in terms of the virus. Once we stop I think there’s a tremendous pent-up demand both in terms of the stock market, in terms of the economy. Once this goes away, once it goes through and we’re done with it, I think you’re going to see a tremendous, a tremendous surge.
Steve: (27:03)
Are you looking at any domestic travel restrictions? I know that’s been on the table before, but is that firming up at all?
Donald Trump: (27:10)
We’re not really. We hope we don’t have to, Steve. We think that hopefully we won’t have to do that. But it’s certainly something that we talk about every day. We haven’t made that decision.
Speaker 9: (27:21)
Mr. President, can I ask you, doctors and nurses in this country are telling us across the board that they’re terrified of this virus, of the fact that they can get it, or the fact that they might take it home to their families. What can you say to assure healthcare providers in this country that the federal government is doing something today to ensure that they get personal protective equipment to protect themselves and their family?
Donald Trump: (27:40)
I think the federal government’s doing everything that we can possibly do. We made some very good early decisions by keeping people out, by keeping countries out, certain countries where the infection was very immense. I noticed a lot of people are talking about South Korea because they’ve a good job on one side, but on the other side, tremendous problems at the beginning. They had tremendous problems and great numbers of death. I think that we’ve done a fantastic job from just about every standpoint.
Donald Trump: (28:09)
With that being said, no matter where you look, this is something. It’s an invisible enemy. But we are speaking all the time, not only with the people, but also the professional people, the nurses, the doctors, they have been doing a fantastic job. We are also working very much on getting them the kind of equipment that they need. For the most part, they either have it or they will be getting it.
Donald Trump: (28:33)
But remember this, we want the governors, we want the mayors, we want them locally, from a local standpoint because it can go quicker, we want them to work. We had a great talk with the governors today. I think it was a really great talk. There’s a tremendous coordination. There’s a tremendous spirit that we have together with the governors. That’s pretty much for the most part, bipartisan. Yeah.
Speaker 10: (28:54)
Mr. President, you told John that you think this could wash through, as you said, July, August. You just told Steve when he asked you about the possibility of a recession, you said, “It may be.” I’m curious if there is a recession, when do you think that might hit?
Donald Trump: (29:09)
I don’t number one determine recession. I just say this. We have an invisible enemy. We have a problem that a month ago nobody ever thought about. I’ve read about it. I read about many years ago, 1917, 1918. I’ve seen all of the different problems similar to this that we’ve had. This is a bad one. This is a very bad one. This is bad in the sense that it’s so contagious. It’s just so contagious, sort of a record setting-type contagion. The good part is the young people they do very well and healthy people do very well. Very, very bad for older people, especially older people with problems. My focus is really on getting rid of this problem, this virus problem. Once we do that, everything else is going to fall into place. Yes, please.
Speaker 11: (30:08)
Mr. President, there were a lot of rumors last night that you were going to put in a national curfew or some kind of texting stuff.
Donald Trump: (30:17)
I’ve been watching.
Speaker 11: (30:18)
Right, exactly. Me too. Your people were saying this is a foreign disinformation campaign, is that what’s going on? Are people messing with us on the internet?
Donald Trump: (30:25)
I don’t know. That I can’t tell you if they are or not. I think a lot of the media actually has been very fair. I think people are pulling together on this. I really think the media has been very fair. I think it could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games, but it doesn’t matter. We haven’t really determined to do that at all and hopefully we won’t have to. That’s a very big step. It’s a step we can take, but we have not decided to do it. Jennifer, go.
Jennifer: (30:53)
Mr. President, two things, one on airlines and one on Jeff Bezos. Can you talk a little bit specifically about what you’d like to do to help the airlines first of all? Then second of all, we heard that Jeff Bezos has been in contact with the White House daily. Can you say what he’s been asking for or proposing to do?
Donald Trump: (31:07)
I’ve heard that’s true. I don’t know that for a fact, but I know that some of my people have, as I understand it, have been dealing with them or with him. That’s nice. We’ve had tremendous support from a lot of people that can help. I believe he was one of them.
Donald Trump: (31:23)
As far as the airlines are concerned, were going to back the airlines 100%. it’s not their fault. It’s nobody’s fault unless you go to the original source, but it’s nobody’s fault. We’re going to be in a position to help the airlines very much. We’ve told the airlines we’re going to help them.
John: (31:41)
They want $25 billion dollars.
Donald Trump: (31:42)
We’re going to be helping. We’re going to be backstopping the airlines. We’re going to be helping them very much, John. It’s very important.
Speaker 12: (31:47)
What will you do about the stock market, sir?
John: (31:49)
The $25 billion dollars for the passenger carriers and $4 billion for cargo?
Donald Trump: (31:53)
We’re going to be looking at it very strongly. We have to back the airlines. It’s not their fault. In fact, they were having a record season. Everybody was. They were having record seasons. Then this came out and it came out from nowhere. Not their fault, but we’re going to be back the airline. Yeah.
Speaker 13: (32:08)
Stocks continue to fall today. Would the White House support negative rates?
Donald Trump: (32:11)
Best thing I can do for the stock market is we have to get through this crisis. That’s what I can do. That’s the best thing we can do. That’s what I think about. Once this virus has gone, I think you’re going to have a stock market like nobody’s ever seen before.
Mike Pence: (32:24)
[inaudible 00:32:26].
Donald Trump: (32:24)
Oh, okay.
Speaker 14: (32:24)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Speaker 15: (32:24)
Will people be voting tomorrow, Mr. President?
Speaker 14: (32:31)
Mr. President, the other day-
Dr. Fauci: (32:32)
He’ll be back in a sec. He’ll be back in a second. I think that the question that I think maybe John asked about until July, the guidelines are a 15-day trial guideline to be reconsidering. It isn’t that these guidelines are now going to be in effect until July. What the President was saying is that the trajectory of the outbreak may go till then. Make sure we don’t think that these are solid in stone until July.
Donald Trump: (32:56)
Yeah. That would be the outside number.
Speaker 14: (33:00)
Mr. President-
Donald Trump: (33:01)
Hold on one second. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 16: (33:02)
To follow up. Do you want Senate Republicans to change the package that had passed the House last week even though you [crosstalk 00:33:11]-
Donald Trump: (33:11)
I think they may make it even better. Look, they’re working together very well with the House. They are working very much in unison, like the question before. They’re working to only enhance it and make it better and make it fair for everybody. That’s what we’re looking to do. We may go back and forth with the House a little bit, but both will be in a very positive fashion. Please.
Speaker 17: (33:33)
Mr. President, these new guidelines say avoid social gatherings and groups of more than 10 people. The CDC’s recommendations yesterday were for people to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people. What’s evolved in you and your team’s thinking in just the past 24 hours. Also, what exactly do you need to see in a stimulus bill?
Donald Trump: (33:54)
Let me just have the professionals answer that. Would you like to do that? Please.
Dr. Birx: (33:57)
Great. Thank you and thank you for that question. We have been working on models day and night around the globe to really predict. Because some countries are in a very early stage like the United States. We’ve been working with groups in the United Kingdom. We had new information coming out from a model and what had the biggest impact in the model is social distancing, small groups, not going in public in large groups. But the most important thing was if one person in the household became infected, the whole household self-quarantined for 14 days, because that stops 100% of the transmission outside of the household.
Dr. Birx: (34:40)
As we talked about early on, it’s silent. We had another silent epidemic, HIV. I just want to recognize the HIV epidemic was solved by the community. The HIV advocates and activists who stood up when no one was listening and got everyone’s attention. We’re asking that same sense of community to come together and stand up against this virus. If everybody in America does what we ask for over the next 15 days, we will see a dramatic difference and we won’t have to worry about the ventilators. We won’t have to worry about the ICU beds because we won’t have our elderly and our people at the greatest risk having to be hospitalized.
Speaker 18: (35:21)
Excuse me, Dr. Birx. Can we ask for a comment on the [crosstalk 00:13:24], Doctor?
Donald Trump: (35:26)
Go ahead, Yes, Mike.
Mike Pence: (35:28)
Thank you, Mr. President. Very productive call today with governors. We talked about the new rollout of testing that we described yesterday and drive-thru and community-based testing. I know how grateful the President is for the efforts that our governors are making and now with the Admiral and the United States Public Health Service as well as FEMA. We’ve made great progress today in coordinating those efforts.
Mike Pence: (35:59)
But the other issue that was raised with the President today was personal protective equipment. The reason I mentioned testing is because one of the recommendations that we have for states is that these remote testing sites make a priority of two groups. One would be people over the age of 65 that have symptoms. We don’t want them to go to hospitals or emergency rooms. We want them to go to a remote site in a parking lot or at a isolated community location.
Mike Pence: (36:27)
But the other category is our healthcare workers. We want to make sure that our healthcare workers have the opportunity to be tested and using that new high throughput test that the President arranged with our major commercial labs, we’ll be able to do that much more expeditiously. We’re putting a real priority on our extraordinary health care workers that are at this very hour coming alongside that are struggling with the coronavirus and people that are concerned that they may have been exposed.
Mike Pence: (36:56)
The other piece is we’re grateful that the legislation passed by the House of Representatives includes liability protection for N95 masks produced by companies like 3M in Minnesota, by Honeywell. Literally tens of millions of masks are produced every year for industrial purposes for construction, but the health experts say they can be used just as readily to protect healthcare workers from respiratory ailments. 3M and other companies were not able to sell those to hospitals, but the President negotiated with the Democratic leadership of the House and Senate. We’ve added a provision to the bill that will literally from one company alone add another 30 million masks per month back to the marketplace.
Mike Pence: (37:41)
We’re strengthening the supply chain and healthcare workers around America can be absolutely certain that the President and our entire team are going to continue to put the health of America first and put first our healthcare workers across this country that are meeting the needs of the people of our country.
Speaker 19: (37:58)
Mr. Vice President?
Donald Trump: (37:58)
Admiral, perhaps you could-
Speaker 19: (38:01)
Mr. Vice President, how many test kits have been sent out and how many people can actually be tested?
Donald Trump: (38:05)
I think the admiral can answer that and you might want to talk about the roving also.
Admiral Giroir: (38:11)
Thank you very much for that. As we talked about yesterday, we’re really entering a new phase of testing. At first we were at the initial phase where the CDC-developed test was only available in public health laboratories and the CDC. Works very well for a few thousand tests per day after it gets running. We’re now moving into a phase that the big commercial laboratories with high throughput screening have availability. As we talked about last week, because of the historic efforts of the FDA Roche test, and as the President predicted, a Thermo Fisher test were both produced last week under an emergency use authorization. 1.9 million of those tests will be sequentially into the ecosystem this week.
Admiral Giroir: (38:59)
From the information we have right now, 1 million tests are available with all the reagents, everything ready to go, primarily at the reference labs called Quest, LabCorp and a couple others. Now it doesn’t matter if they are not in your neighborhood because every day when people get tests, a little white box goes out in front, it gets shipped by an incredible distribution system, the test result, and it’s electronically reported. These are available to people nationwide.
Admiral Giroir: (39:27)
We expect more and more than 1 million coming onboard this week as the reagents come up and as people with the testing capacity validate that in their own hospitals and other places. In the future, we expect at least 2 million next week and at least 5 million the week thereafter. There are also a whole growth of what’s called laboratory-determined testing or laboratory-derived testing where individual laboratories because of the regulatory deregulation of the FDA, can develop their own tests and start using them. If you’re a CLIA-certified lab with complexity, you can do that.
Admiral Giroir: (40:06)
The point is testing is now entering sort of what we normally do in the healthcare system where big labs in a high throughput basis receive these through normal channels. That part of that is really underway.
Speaker 19: (40:20)
But, do you know how many Americans have actually been tested? Do you have a number?
Admiral Giroir: (40:25)
There is a number. I don’t have that number because I’ve been working on setting up this distribution system. This is where we are. The state and public health laboratories and the CDC are published everyday on the CDC website. The CDC gets feeds from LabCorp and Quest. They get that on a daily basis. What is not being received right now and Ambassador Birx is fixing is that these homegrown tests in highly complex labs don’t necessarily get reported in the system.
Admiral Giroir: (40:56)
However, as we move forward, particularly in the height, in the commercial phase of where we are right now, we expect about 80% to 85% of the tests to flow right into the CDC. We know them. That’s not good enough for Ambassador Birx. She wants a 100% and we’ll work on that.
Donald Trump: (41:14)
I think just to put it a different way, a lot of testing has been going on. I don’t believe anybody has been able to do what we’re doing and what we will be doing.
Admiral Giroir: (41:23)
Let me just say that we talked about the drive-thru testing yesterday. I want it to be clear to everybody. This is just another tool for states and local public health systems and healthcare systems to use. It’s not replacing testing that goes on in a doctor’s office or in a hospital or if you go to your doctor and want to get tested in that office. This is just another tool that we’re helping the states to have.
Admiral Giroir: (41:46)
Again as we talked about, this is modeled on the FEMA-based points of distribution system optimized for testing. We expect this week, we now have gear, people being shipped right now, today that will be in over 12 states with multiple sites, many of states having multiple sites to start augmenting the local capacity and really providing the state and the local people what they need as another way for people to get tested.
Donald Trump: (42:20)
This has never been done before. That’s never been done and certainly not on a level like that. I will say that I think I can speak for the professionals that if you don’t have the symptoms, if your doctor doesn’t think you need it, don’t get the test. Don’t get the test. I think that’s very important. Not everybody should run out and get the test, but we’re able to handle tremendous numbers of people.
Donald Trump: (42:43)
John?
John: (42:43)
Mr. President, earlier today Governor Cuomo of New York said that he believes that hospital capacity soon will be overwhelmed and implored you to call on the Army Corps of Engineers to build temporary facilities to house patients. Is that something [crosstalk 00:42:59]-
Donald Trump: (42:59)
We’re looking into it. We’ve heard that. We’ve heard it from really two places. There are two places that have specifically, New York being one. We are looking into it very strongly. Yeah.
Donald Trump: (43:11)
Steve, go ahead please.
Steve: (43:12)
Sir, how have you changed your own behavior to take account of this virus? Are you washing your hands more?
Donald Trump: (43:18)
I’ve always washed my hands a lot. I wash my hands a lot. Maybe, if anything, more, certainly not less.
Speaker 20: (43:27)
What was it like taking the test?
Donald Trump: (43:28)
Not something I want to do every day. I can tell you that. It’s a little bit of … good doctors in the White House, but it’s a test. It’s a test. It’s a medical test. Nothing pleasant about it.
Speaker 21: (43:42)
You said that in a Tweet that Governor Cuomo should be doing more.
Donald Trump: (43:53)
I think he can do more.
Speaker 21: (43:54)
What specifically should he be doing if he can?
Donald Trump: (43:55)
I think he can do more. It’s an area of the country that’s very hot right now. I think New Rochelle, a place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle.
Donald Trump: (44:02)
Place I know very well. I grew up right near New Rochelle. I think it’s a very, no I think it’s an area that has to be tamped down even more. Because it’s a hotbed. There’s no question about it. So I think they could look at doing it. But we’re getting along very well. We’ve had a very, in fact, I noticed he made some statements just now that the relationship with the federal government has been good. That federal government has done everything they’ve wanted us to do.
Donald Trump: (44:25)
But we can, I think it’s very important that all of the governors get along very well with us. And that we get along with the governors and I think that’s happening.
Group: (44:33)
[crosstalk 00:44:39].
Speaker 22: (44:33)
The Defense Secretary and the Assistant Defense Secretary decided to separate and be in a bubble to avoid the spread of the disease and to protect the chain of command. Is that something you and the Vice President should be doing? And has there been any talk about having to have a 25th Amendment procedure in place?
Donald Trump: (44:52)
Well, we haven’t thought of it. But you know, I will say this, we’re very careful. We’re very careful with being together. Even the people behind me they’ve been very strongly tested. I’ve been very strongly tested and we have to be very careful. But everybody should be very vigilant. We have to be vigilant. Yeah please.
Group: (45:20)
[crosstalk 00:45:18].
Donald Trump: (45:20)
Go ahead please.
Speaker 23: (45:20)
Two simple questions for you Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (45:20)
Hold it, hold it. Before you.
Speaker 24: (45:21)
Okay. I don’t know if this is a question for you or Dr. Birx. But Dr. Birx said that it is the millennials who are going to lead us through this and that now is the time to look out for the older people in our home. Older might be a state of mind, not necessarily an age. So for those millennials of us who have parents who are in their fifties, sixties, seventies what is older? What should we tell them at this point?
Dr. Birx: (45:48)
Well, if I was Dr. Fauci I would tell you there’s a physiologic age and a numerical age. So older people with preexisting conditions. And what do we mean by that? Significant heart disease, significant kidney disease, significant lung disease, any immunosuppression, any recent treatment for cancer. Any of those pieces on any household.
Dr. Birx: (46:13)
Now why do I think the millennials are the key? Because they’re the ones that are out. And about and they’re the most likely to be in social gatherings. And they’re the most likely to be the least symptomatic. And I think we’ve always heard about the greatest generation. We’re protecting the greatest generation right now and the children are the greatest generation.
Dr. Birx: (46:32)
And I think the millennials can help us tremendously by having… plus they need to communicate with each other. Public health people like myself don’t always come out with compelling and exciting messages that a 25 to 35 year old may find interesting and something that they’ll take to heart. But millennials can speak to one another about how important it is in this moment to protect all of the people.
Dr. Birx: (47:01)
Now you could be 40 and have a significant medical condition and be a substantial risk. You could be 30 and having come through Hodgkin’s Disease or Non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma and be of a significant risk. So there are risk groups in every age group, but there’s more millennials now than any other cohort. And they can help us at this moment.
Group: (47:23)
[crosstalk 00:47:28].
Speaker 23: (47:23)
Thank you very much. [crosstalk 00:47:28] Thank you very much. Mr president, you already talked. Mr. President the other day you said that you were not responsible for the testing shortfall. Very simple question. Does the buck stop with you? And on a scale of one to 10 how would you rate your response to this crisis?
Donald Trump: (47:42)
I’d rate it a ten. I think we’ve done a great job. And it started with the fact that we kept a very highly infected country despite, even the professionals saying, “No, it’s too early to do that.” We were very, very early with respect to China. And we would have a whole different situation in this country. If we didn’t do that. I would rate ourselves and the professional. I think the professionals have done a fantastic job.
Donald Trump: (48:10)
As far as the testing. You heard the Admiral, I think the testing that we’ve done. We really took over an obsolete system. Or put it maybe in a different way, a system that wasn’t meant to do anything like this. We took it over and we’re doing something that’s never been done in this country. And I think that we are doing very well. We took the system, we worked with the system we had and we broke down the system purposely. We broke it down in order to do what we’re doing now. And within a short period of time and even now we’re testing tremendous numbers of people. And ultimately you’re saying, it will be what? It will be up to how many people will be able to test?
Admiral Giroir: (48:48)
We certainly expect with the high throughput testing that that’s no longer a barrier. The barrier is actually doing the test on a person. And I’m sure as the president would inform you in order to do the test, a healthcare provider needs to dress in full personal protective equipment, full personal protective equipment. And there’s a swab that’s put in the back of the nose all the way to the back of the throat. It’s called a nasal pharyngeal swab, which is then put in media. The next person who has to get tested, that healthcare provider has to change all the personal protective equipment. When you put that in, it’s highly likely a person coughs or sneezes so you’re at risk. So that’s what we’re trying to fix now by the mobile platforms, by all the things we’re doing is to enable high throughput of this swabbing. And we’re doing some technological things too that might be breakthroughs to make it much, much faster. But we certainly expect that from thousands of people per day we will be at the tens of thousands of people per day this week according to those who are [inaudible 00:49:51]
Speaker 25: (49:51)
Does the buck stop with you, Mr president? Does the buck stop with you?
Donald Trump: (49:54)
Yeah, normally. But I think when you hear the, “This has never been done before in this country.” If you look back take a look at some of the things that took place in ’09 or ’11 or whatever it may have been nobody’s ever done anything like what we’re doing. Now. I will also say Admiral, I think we can say that we’re also getting this ready for the future. So that when we have a future problem, if and when, and hopefully we don’t have anything like this. But if there is, we’re going to be starting off from a much higher plateau. Because we were at a very, very low base. We had a system that was not meant for this. It was a smaller system. It was meant for a much different purpose and for that purpose it was fine. But not for this purpose. So we broke down the system and now we have something that’s going to be and is very special and is ready for future problems. I think we can say that very strongly. Yeah.
Group: (50:47)
[crosstalk 00:50:50].
Donald Trump: (50:47)
Go ahead please.
Speaker 26: (50:51)
Thank you Mr. President. How close are you to shutting down America’s northern border with Canada? And could you also speak to the fact about the elections that are supposed to be taking place tomorrow? Is it your advice that those states postpone those elections?
Donald Trump: (51:06)
Well, I’d leave that up to the states. It’s a big thing. Postponing an election. I think to me that really goes to the heart of what we’re all about. I think postponing and elections is a very tough thing I know they’re doing, because they’ve been in touch with us, they’re doing it very carefully. They’re spreading people out at great distances as you can see. And I think they’ll do it very safely. I hope they do it very safely, but I think postponing elections is not a very good thing. They have lots of room and a lot of the electoral places. And I think that they will do it very well, but I think postponing is unnecessary.
Speaker 26: (51:40)
On the Norther border, sir? How close are you to shutting it down. [crosstalk 00:51:43]
Donald Trump: (51:43)
We think about it. We think about it. If we don’t have to do it, that’ll be good. We have very strong emergency powers when it comes to something like this, both on the Southern and the Northern borders. And we are talking about different things, but we’ll see. Right now we have not decided to do that. Steve.
Steve: (51:57)
Sir are we getting Dr.Fauci to talk about the vaccine trial today? And whether the timetable for vaccine is it possible accelerate? Are is it still 12-18 months?
Dr. Fauci: (52:08)
Thank you for that question. The vaccine candidate that was given the first injection for the first person took place today. You might recall when we first started, I said it would be two to three months. And if we did that, that would be the fastest we’ve ever gone from obtaining the sequence to being able to do a phase one trial.
Dr. Fauci: (52:27)
This has been now 65 days, which I believe is the record. What it is, it’s a trial of 45 normal individuals between the ages of 18 and 55. The trial is taking place in Seattle. There will be two injections, one at zero day, first one, then 28 days. There will be three separate doses, 25 milligrams, 100 milligrams, 250 milligrams. And the individuals will be followed for one year. Both for safety and whether it induces the kind of response that we predict would be protective. And that’s exactly what I’ve been telling this group over and over again. So it’s happened. The first injection was today.
Group: (53:08)
[crosstalk 00:00:53:08].
Speaker 27: (53:09)
Sir the market just closed down 3000, almost 13%. Your response to the market close sir?
Speaker 28: (53:13)
[crosstalk 00:53:13] Pregnancy. Is pregnancy an underlying condition?
Donald Trump: (53:13)
Go ahead please.
Speaker 29: (53:13)
Dr. Fauci is there guidance for someone who may have felt sick but then feels better? So you had symptoms but you no longer do, your fever is gone away. How long would you stay home after that point? That’s not clear from the guidelines.
Dr. Fauci: (53:27)
If you are positive for the infection. If you have coronavirus, it is less how you feel than whether or not you’re still shedding virus. So the general issue about letting people out of a facility who, for example a hospital or whatever, who have been infected, you need two negative cultures the same way that was just described 24 hours apart.
Donald Trump: (53:53)
Yeah, no the marked will take care of itself. The market will be a very strong as soon as we get rid of the virus. Yes.
Group: (54:06)
[crosstalk 00:00:54:06].
Speaker 28: (54:09)
Can you clarify about pregnant women? Is that an underlying? Because the UK said today that pregnancy was one of those underlying conditions. Do we say that too?
Dr. Birx: (54:15)
There’s very little data on pregnant women. I think I, about a week ago, I said that reports that came in from China, from the Chinese CDC. Of the nine women who were documented to be pregnant and have coronavirus in their last tri-semester delivered healthy children and they themselves were healthy and recovered. That is our total sample size and we will be getting more data from countries. While countries are in the midst of this crisis like Italy, I try not to bother them frequently to get us their data. We try to get it just weekly from the countries that are in the midst of responding to the epidemic. So that their focus is on their individuals in their country.
Speaker 30: (54:59)
Mr.President. Any comment on what people like Devin Nunez, the Governor of Oklahoma had been saying? Encouraging people to go out to restaurants, which goes directly against what this advice in your guidelines says.
Donald Trump: (55:10)
I haven’t heard that. I haven’t heard that from Devin or anybody else.
Speaker 31: (55:13)
Should they stop saying that?
Donald Trump: (55:16)
Well I have to see what they said. But-
Speaker 31: (55:17)
They encouraged people to go to restaurants, if they felt okay with their families.
Donald Trump: (55:20)
Well, I would disagree with it. But right now we don’t have an order one way or the other. We don’t have an order, but I think it’s probably better that you don’t. Especially in certain areas, Oklahoma doesn’t have a tremendous problem. You said the Governor of Oklahoma?
Speaker 31: (55:34)
Governor of Oklahoma, Devin Nunez-
Donald Trump: (55:36)
And Devin.
Speaker 31: (55:36)
… was another.
Donald Trump: (55:37)
Yeah, well I had heard that.
Speaker 31: (55:38)
So should they be doing that or should they not be doing that in Oklahoma?
Donald Trump: (55:41)
[crosstalk 00:55:41] I would said verse to what the professionals are saying.
Speaker 31: (55:43)
And what you’re saying in your guidelines.
Donald Trump: (55:45)
Yeah.
Speaker 31: (55:45)
Is that people shouldn’t be going to restaurants.
Donald Trump: (55:48)
I’ll take a look at it. Absolutely.
John: (55:51)
I don’t know who would be best to answer this question. Maybe a Secretary Azar or Dr.Fauci. Schools districts across the country are closing down. Yet for the most part, daycare centers remain open. And considering the children can sometimes be asymptomatic carriers and go home to older individuals. Are there any recommendations about daycare centers?
Secretary Azar: (56:13)
I prefer one of our medical professionals discuss that. That’s a clinical recommendation.
Dr. Fauci: (56:19)
That’s a good question John. In the original guidelines as they were presented it was schools, not daycare. I think it’s very important we should probably, if we have not discussed that, go back and discuss that in some detail about whether or not that’s equivalent to school. It’s a good question.
Speaker 4: (56:34)
But the question about the sort of underlying public health strategy behind some of these guidelines. Telling people to avoid restaurants and bars is a different thing than saying that bars and restaurants should shut down over the next 15 days. So why was it seen as being imprudent or not necessarily to take that additional step offered at additional guidance?
Donald Trump: (56:51)
Do you want to answer that?
Dr. Birx: (56:55)
Well, I think we have to say the data that has been coming out, and I’m sure you’re all up to date on how long the virus lives on hard surfaces. And that has been our concern over the last two weeks.
Dr. Fauci: (57:07)
Don’t, I’m sorry go ahead. I just want, there’s an answer to this.
Dr. Birx: (57:15)
Oh, go ahead Tony. He was my mentor so I’m going to have to let him speak.
Dr. Fauci: (57:19)
The small print here. It’s really small print. “In states with evidence of community transmission, bars, restaurants, food courts, gyms and other indoor and outdoor venues where groups of people congregate should be closed.”
Speaker 32: (57:35)
[crosstalk 00:57:35] So Mr. President are you telling governors in those states then to close all their restaurants and their bars?
Donald Trump: (57:42)
Well we haven’t said that yet.
Speaker 32: (57:43)
Why not?
Donald Trump: (57:43)
We’re recommending but-
Speaker 32: (57:44)
But if you think this would work.
Donald Trump: (57:44)
… we’re recommending things. No, we haven’t gone to that step yet. That could happen, but we haven’t gone there yet. Please.
Speaker 33: (57:50)
So on the election, you’re saying it’s a bad thing to postpone it. But if you’ve got the 25 person maximum guideline in a practical sense, can you have rallies? Primaries, surely gather more than ten people.
Donald Trump: (58:04)
Well hopefully it will pas through and hopefully everybody will be going to restaurants and flying and being on cruise ships and all of these different things that we do. And it will very, very hopefully be at a fairly quick period of time. But we’re taking a tough stance. We may make certain other decisions, we may enhance those decisions. We’re going to find out as per the question that you were asking, some of those decisions may be hence. How about one more? Jennifer.
Jennifer: (58:33)
On the cyber attack on HHS.
Donald Trump: (58:35)
Yeah.
Jennifer: (58:35)
Is there any reason to believe that they were trying to hack into the system and gather information from the system? And also is there any reason? So were they trying to hack to get information? And also do you have any reason to think that it could have been Iran? Russia? Do you have any reason to believe it was a foreign actor?
Secretary Azar: (58:51)
So in the previous 24 hours we saw a great deal of enhanced activity with relation to the HHS computer systems and website. Fortunately we have extremely strong barriers. We had no penetration into our networks. We had no degradation of the functioning of our networks. We had no limitation of our capacity for people to tele-work. We’ve taken very strong defensive actions. The source of this enhanced activity remains under investigation so I wouldn’t want to speculate on the source of it. But there was no data breach or no degradation in terms of our ability to function and serve our important mission here. Thank you.
Speaker 34: (59:24)
Mr. Vice President have you been tested yet? [crosstalk 00:59:26]
Speaker 35: (59:26)
What are you looking for in another stimulus package sir. Could you speak to that?
Donald Trump: (59:30)
One thing Mike just said, it’s very important to get out that this is for the next, much of what we’re talking about is for the next 15 days. Mike go ahead.
Speaker 34: (59:39)
Mr. Vice President have you been tested?
Mike Pence: (59:41)
I’ve not been tested yet. I’m in regular consultation with the White House Physician and he said, I’ve not been exposed to anyone for any period of time ahead of the coronavirus, and that my wife and I have no symptoms. But we’re checking our temperature regularly every day and we’ll continue to follow guidance.
Mike Pence: (01:00:02)
Which I think may be a good place to land at the end of the day. And that is as we expand testing rapidly around the country through the new public/private partnership that the president facilitated, we want the test to be available for people who have symptoms. People that who have symptoms and are in vulnerable populations and our healthcare workers to make sure that they can have the peace of mind that they’re doing their jobs and they’re properly protected.
Mike Pence: (01:00:33)
And so our best council, the council of the experts is if you have a question, call your doctor, call your healthcare provider, ask whether or not you should be tested. And that’s what my family is doing as well.
Mike Pence: (01:00:44)
Let me just emphasize one more point if I can. The president asked the task force to continuously review the data and the information that we have, not only in this country but from around the world. To give the best guidance to state leadership and local healthcare leadership and all of the American people about how to keep themselves, their family and their community safe. This guidance for the next 15 days is what our experts say is the best opportunity we have to lower the infection rate over the entire course of the coronavirus. Just as the president did by suspending travel from China, just as he did with travel advisories and screening from Italy and South Korea. Just as we’ve done with Europe and at midnight tonight with the UK and Ireland.
Mike Pence: (01:01:35)
We will continue to take very decisive steps to lower the spread of the coronavirus. But we want every American to know and we would ask all of you in the media to spread the word of the American people. That this is advice on behalf of the President of the United States to every American what you can do over the next 15 days to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. And we’re calling on every American to do your part because together we’ll get through this and we’ll find our way forward.
Donald Trump: (01:02:08)
Just one more. Steve go ahead please.
Steve: (01:02:08)
You had a G7-
Donald Trump: (01:02:08)
Yeah.
Steve: (01:02:08)
… video conference today.
Donald Trump: (01:02:08)
We had a G7.
Steve: (01:02:08)
What was the upshot of it?
Donald Trump: (01:02:16)
It was-
Steve: (01:02:17)
Are you’re still going to be able to meet at Camp David.
Donald Trump: (01:02:19)
It looks like it.
Speaker 36: (01:02:20)
And are you confident in their responses? As you are with Europe?
Donald Trump: (01:02:22)
I am very confident. They’re in a position that some of them are in a rough position. If you look at a couple of them. And some are heading toward pretty rough territory. We had a very good a conference. It was a teleconference. Everybody was on the phone, every leader. And almost a hundred percent was devoted to the subject that we’re talking about today. And they are working very hard and they’re very concerned obviously, but they’re working very hard. But I would say just about all of it was Steve, all of it was devoted to what we’re talking about.
Steve: (01:02:57)
Hold that summit at Camp David?
Donald Trump: (01:02:59)
I think so. I mean so far it seems, we didn’t even discuss that. It’s still a ways off. But it was a very good discussion and there’s a great comradery. There’s a great togetherness. I think I can say that very, very strongly. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Mar 15, 2020","27, 2020
5:22 P.M. EST","Donald Trump: (00:06)
Beautiful day outside. And then I think we have some great things to talk about. I’ll start by discussing the Federal Reserve. As you know, it just happened minutes ago, but to me it makes me very happy. And I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve. For starters, they’ve lowered the fed rate from what it was, which was one to 1.25. And it’s been lowered down to zero to 0.25 or 0.25. So it’s zero to .25 that’s a big difference. It’s a quite a bit, about a point.
Donald Trump: (00:47)
And in addition, very importantly, the Federal Reserve going to be purchasing $500 billion of treasuries and $200 billion of mortgage backed securities. And that number can increase, but they’re going to start with that and that’s really good news. It’s really great for our country. It’s something that we’re very happy, I have to say this. I’m very happy and they did it in one step. They didn’t do it in four steps over a long period of time. They did it on one step.
Donald Trump: (01:18)
And I think that people in the market should be very thrilled. And that brings us, we’re the strongest country in the world by far financially and every other way. And that brings us in line with what other countries are. They actually have negative rates, but look, we got it down to potentially zero. So that’s a big step and I’m very happy they did it.
Donald Trump: (01:43)
And you will not hear anything bad about me unless it’s about a month or two from now. So I congratulate the Federal Reserve. I think it’s terrific. Just came out just as we spoke, I wasn’t going to mention Federal Reserve or anything else, but this came out as we were walking up.
Donald Trump: (01:58)
I want to thank the people at Google and Google communications because as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who’s a great gentleman, called us and he apologized. I don’t know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace. But as you know, this is from Google. They put out a release and you guys can figure it out yourselves. And how that got out, and I’m sure you’ll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful.
Donald Trump: (02:32)
I just had a phone call with very impressive people, the biggest in the world, in the world of stores and groceries and all. And I’ll give you the names Dave Clark, Whole Foods. Mark Clouse, CEO of Campbell Soup Company. Brian Cornell, CEO of Target, Randy Edeker, Chairman and CEO, President of Hy-Vee, Jeff Haremning, CEO of General Mills, great company. Kevin Birkin President, CEO of Sysco. Craig Jelinek, CEO of Costco. Todd Jones, CEO of Publix Supermarkets, Donnie King Tyson Foods. David MacLennan, Chairman and CEO of Cargill. Rodney McMillan, CEO, Chairman of Kroger, big company. Doug McMillan, CEO of Walmart. He’s been fantastic. Doug was here, as you know, on Friday and he watched the market go up 2000 points on Friday. It went up 2000 almost 2000 points. Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General Corporation, and Vivek San Quran, President and CEO of Albertson’s.
Donald Trump: (04:03)
So these are all phenomenal companies. He’s a great companies. We had a long conversation with them and they’re going to work 24 hours around the clock, keeping their store stocked. I would like to say that people shouldn’t go out and buy. We’re going to all be great. We’re going to be so good. We’re going to do, what’s happened with the fed is phenomenal news. What’s happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news. But you don’t have to buy so much. Take it easy. Just relax. People are going in and they’re buying more. I remember, I guess during the conversation, Doug of Walmart said that they buying more than they buy a Christmas. Relax, we’re doing great. It all will pass.
Donald Trump: (04:47)
The folks that we spoke to, they’ve done a fantastic job. They’re going to meet the needs of the public. They’re going round the clock if they have to and they’re committed to the communities where they’re serving and which they serve so beautifully and have for a long time. And they’re buying a lot of additional things to sell. But again, they actually have asked me to say, “Could you buy a little bit less please?” I thought I’d never hear that from a retailer. All of them are working hand in hand with the Federal Government as well as the state and local leaders to ensure food and essentials are constantly available. And they’ll do it. There’s no shortages. We have no shortages other than people are buying anywhere from three to five times what they would normally buy.
Donald Trump: (05:31)
It’s going to be there for a long time. We’re doing numbers and there’s a pent up demand that’s incredible. When this passes, when this goes through, you’re going to see numbers. I think, I predict, I guess I’m allowed to predict just like Wall Street people are allowed to predict and they’re pretty much in agreement. You’re going to see there’s a pent up demand like a lot of people including me haven’t seen before. But this has to get through.
Donald Trump: (05:57)
They know they’re getting through the crisis and will require an all of America approach and that’s very important. They’re committed to remaining open during this crisis. Totally open. They have to stay open. Those doors have to stay open. They supply our country. Our supply chains in America, the most powerful in the world, and they’re all working very hard. They’re working around the clock and the stores are stocking up at a level that’s beyond Christmas time. And it’s great. It was very reassuring speaking to these people. They have a totally in hand.
Donald Trump: (06:28)
There’s no need for anybody in the country to hoard essential food supplies. They said to me, “Could you please tell them just go and buy. Enjoy it, have a nice dinner, relax because there’s plenty.” You don’t have to buy the quantities because it’s hard to refill the stores on a basis as rapid as they’re refilling them.
Donald Trump: (06:50)
And we are using the full power of the Federal Government to defeat the coronavirus. And we will do whatever it takes and we’re doing, I think really, really well. A lot of good things are going to happen. I want to thank all of the people standing behind me. These are phenomenal people and we have some of them right over here. But the people behind me have been working around the clock and they’re doing an incredible job.
Donald Trump: (07:18)
We see what’s happening. We see what’s going on in other countries. We’re learning from watching other countries, frankly. This is a very contagious virus. It’s incredible, but it’s something that we have a tremendous control of. I think very important the young people, people of good health and groups of people just are not strongly affected. Elderly people that are not well or not well in certain respects are a really a very dangerous group. We have to watch them, we have to protect them very much. We have to really watch over them and protect them because they are very vulnerable. And with that if it’s okay I’m just going to go and make some calls. I’m talking about Federal Reserve. I think it’s a tremendous thing that took place just now. I didn’t know I would be surprised on a Sunday. I don’t know if that’s ever happened on a Sunday before, but I would think there are a lot of people on Wall Street that are very happy. And I can tell you that I’m very happy. I didn’t expect this and I like being surprised. So our Vice President who is doing an incredible job is going to take over and I will see you probably tomorrow.
Donald Trump: (08:26)
Thank you you very much.
Vice President Pence: (08:40)
Well thank you Mr. President and good afternoon. With more than 2,900 cases of coronavirus in 49 states across the country I want to assure the American people that this administration, all of our partners, the state level and local health officials have no higher priority than the health and safety of the American public. And at the president’s direction we will continue not only a whole of government approach but as we’ll discuss today we’ll continue to build on a whole of America approach to confront the coronavirus across the country.
Vice President Pence: (09:17)
The health experts continue to confirm to us that based on the latest information, for the American people as a whole, the risk of serious illness remains low. But because the risk is heavily weighted to the most vulnerable, to people with immunodeficiencies and to people who are elderly with serious underlying chronic health conditions. Our administration and I know state administrations will continue to focus on the most vulnerable. And we will continue to urge every American to be vigilant in practicing good hygiene. Taking the advice of the CDC and local health experts to keep those most vulnerable, safe.
Vice President Pence: (10:04)
I know I speak on behalf of the president and our entire team when I say how grateful we are for governors all across the country and the seamless partnership that we have forged with them and with state health officials, with our federal team. I spoke today to Governor Pritzker of Illinois and we are in continuous communication with governors, a phone call away. They know that they, they can contact us and address even the smallest need. Because as a former governor, I know firsthand that when it comes to health challenges in America, our states are on the ground in the lead, our local health organizations and we’ve built a great partnership.
Vice President Pence: (10:47)
We also want to express great appreciation to the American people. Not surprisingly, it is inspiring to see the way tens of millions of Americans are responding with compassion, with common sense. And we want to express particular gratitude to communities of faith that participated in today’s National Day of Prayer.
Vice President Pence: (11:06)
We’ve seen places of worship, implementing policies to keep those most vulnerable, safe. And also we’re seeing communities of faith already stepping forward to support and to encourage those most vulnerable. I heard tell of a church back in Indiana that’s actually no longer having services until April 10th. But in the meantime there’ll be offering daycare to the children of healthcare workers in central Indiana. And churches all across the country are taking the opportunity to reach out and put feed on their faith and it’s, it’s truly inspiring.
Vice President Pence: (11:44)
As president mentioned today, he spoke today to leaders in the grocery store industry and where people buy our food. And we heard and were reminded that America has the most efficient and effective supply chain in the world. And it’s working just fine. As the president said, he received a commitment from those a grocery store executives that stores will stay open throughout the days that lie ahead.
Vice President Pence: (12:14)
We were told that hours may be reduced to allow for cleaning and to resupply, but American families can be confident. Your local grocery store is going to be open, it’s going to be well supplied and they specifically asked us to encourage Americans just buy your weekly needs and grocery. Because the grocery stores will remain open.
Vice President Pence: (12:36)
Also very movingly those same executives all reiterated their commitment to continue to support local food banks in the way that our grocers continue to do around America. Tomorrow president and I will be briefing all the nation’s governors of states and territories and the District of Columbia. We will be speaking about the progress that we’re making and we’ll be speaking to them specifically about our widening partnership on expanding testing to the American people.
Vice President Pence: (13:07)
So allow me to speak to that issue and then I’m going to recognize Admiral Brett Giroir who will describe for us the the excellent work that public health services doing. Dr. Burks will describe the importance of the new national public private partnership for diagnostic testing that is going to open the door to the thousands of more tests in real time for the American people in the days ahead.
Vice President Pence: (13:37)
First, some fundamentals. As the American people know, testing is now available in all 50 States. Either state labs are either conducting the tests themselves or the CDC is processing tests. They’re using the traditional manner of a manual test that allows for 40 to 60 tests a day. It is among the reasons why the president several weeks ago tasked for this group at the White House to reach out to commercial labs around the country and forge that public/private partnership that would bring the high speed, or more accurately the high throughput testing, for coronavirus available in real time. And based on the unprecedented speed of the FDA, which last week approved high throughput coronavirus testings for Roche and Thermo Fisher. We will now have access in the days ahead to more than 2000 labs across the country that have the equipment today to process coronavirus tests much more rapidly in a much higher volume for the American people.
Vice President Pence: (14:46)
In terms of delivering those services more than 10 States in addition to a CDC labs, public health labs and labs that states can now authorize in their states. More than 10 States have implemented their own drive through testing sites. And we want to commend New York, Colorado, Delaware, Washington State, Texas, and others that have implemented these onsite places where people can obtain tests. Most are using the current CDC testing, the manual testing. But we are working closely with our governors, as you will hear momentarily, to make sure that the new testing regimen is available for their remote sites as well.
Vice President Pence: (15:33)
As I mentioned as of Monday, we will have more than 2000 labs coming online with the high speed testing. And we are connecting states to those testing methods. We’re also working with a number of retail partners to add to the work that states are doing around the country. Working to set up parking lot testing centers outside of stores and Admiral Brett Giroir will detail the progress that we’ve made over the last 72 hours.
Vice President Pence: (16:04)
Following the president’s declaration of emergency the Admiral and our public health service of have forged a partnership now with FEMA made possible by that declaration. And they’ve reached out to all 50 States to create a process that will enable all Americans who need to be tested to go to a community based testing site outside of usual healthcare facilities. The focus of these tests as Dr Burks will describe momentarily will be on the those most in need. A priority will be placed on healthcare workers and first responders who are out there coming alongside people that are being impacted by the coronavirus. We want to make sure they have access to the testing as a priority. And then Americans 65 or over with a cough or a fever or other symptoms will be prioritized over other tests that are extended.
Vice President Pence: (17:01)
As I mentioned, Admiral Giroir will describe the progress that we’ve made in just a few moments. But we’re going to continue to work very diligently, hour by hour, day by day in the days ahead to expand testing around the country. And access to this extraordinary and unprecedented national public/ private partnership for diagnostic testing.
Vice President Pence: (17:24)
With regard to testing, as we expand testing, we’re so pleased that Congress joined with our administration to make sure that cost is never going to be a barrier to anyone getting a coronavirus test. As you recall, several weeks ago the president directed a change in our Medicare and Medicaid programs to ensure the coronavirus testing was included. Health insurers were brought in, they all agreed to waive copays. But because of the good bipartisan work done in the House of Representatives now all coronavirus testing is free and it’s free for every American, including uninsured Americans. And we continue to urge passage of the legislation that will be considered by the Senate this week.
Vice President Pence: (18:08)
Let me say one final word about the testing issue. And that is that as the president often says, “We’re all in this together.” And it’s absolutely important that as we expand testing resources across the country, beginning by prioritizing the areas that CDC and our state leadership tell us are most important. It’s important that the tests are available for people that are most in need and for our healthcare workers and first responders that are helping them and supporting them. As Dr. Burks will describe, the testing that is available should only be done if for any reason you think you may have the coronavirus. We encourage people to consult their doctor and if you’re symptom free, we then encourage you to work with us to make sure the testing is available for people that are experiencing symptoms.
Vice President Pence: (19:10)
It’s extremely important that we have the continuing cooperation of every American as we expand testing and make it available during this challenging time in the life of our nation. With that, I’m going to ask Admiral Brett Giroir of the Public Health Service and leader of this great commission corps behind me to come up and describe the extraordinary work that they have done over the last 72 hours. And will be doing each and every day in conjunction with our states to expand testing to community based testing across the country for the American people using this new public/private partnership diagnostic testing. Admiral.
Admiral Brett Giroir: (19:53)
Thank you Mr. Vice President, and thank you for your personal interest and support of our team over the last 72 hours as we worked on this critically important.
Admiral Giroir: (20:03)
… Over the last 72 hours, as we worked on this critically important project. So as the Vice President said over the past 72 hours, we have developed and are beginning to implement now a process and a program of testing that will enable Americans who are in need of coronavirus testing to be tested effectively and efficiently according to a few principles.
Admiral Giroir: (20:28)
Number one, we want to assure that those most vulnerable and those impacted are able to be prioritized. Number two, we don’t want to do testing that in any way threatens the acute care system. In other words, we don’t want people going to hospitals and acute care clinics where number one, they could infect other people or subject themselves to infections. And number three, we want to balance the needs across the entire healthcare system among diagnosis, but also treatment. In other words, we want the balance, the stress on the strategic national stockpile, and all our commodities so that everyone gets all the materials they need.
Admiral Giroir: (21:09)
So what do we do? Because as the Vice President said, last week’s historically fast approval of high throughput testing, we are now in a new phase of testing. And you’ve heard Dr. Fauci talk about the new phase. So we’re going from somewhat manual, relatively slow phases, to a testing regimen that we can test many tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals per week and maybe even more. We will have 1.9 million of these high throughput tests available this week with numerous labs up to 2000, starting to turn the lights on beginning this week and rolling out over the week.
Admiral Giroir: (21:47)
That is really a game changer for us because the back of the shop testing capability is there. The front of the shop is what we’ve been really working on. In order to get a test there, you’ve got to be able to swab individuals, get them into the system without completely paralyzing the entire healthcare system as we have. So with the emergency declaration, this was very, very important to us because it really enabled the historically effective processes of working and empowering states. Federally-supported state-led efforts through the normal FEMA mechanisms.
Admiral Giroir: (22:24)
So for the last 72 hours, representatives of FEMA from across the government and our Commission Corps have been working on joining the unique and unprecedented public health mission with the historically successful mission of personal distribution centers, places for distribution, the pod system of FEMA. Our public health service, we’ve already deployed over a thousand officers in support of the coronavirus missions that includes to the Diamond, to the borders, to the quarantine stations, to the acute care settings where we’re caring for nursing home residents in Seattle. So we have a very experienced group and we brought these together.
Admiral Giroir: (23:14)
So what we’ve really designed and how we’re working with the states, we have contacted all 50 states through the FEMA system, every single region, every single state, to understand where they are. As the Vice President said, some states are rolling out some of their own community-based testing. They need to be augmented. We believe we’ve created a model based on the public health and the FEMA system that is optimized that can be used for drive through, or potentially walk through. Each of these pod based units we believe can screen 2,000 to 4,000 individuals a day for testing, with all the appropriate personal protective gear, all the appropriate backend and linkage to the public health system including testing. We know that we have the logistics to do that. We know we have the materials to do that. And again, this is federally-supported state-led efforts. Many states need the full meal deal. They want dozens of public health service officers to work in protective gear to actually test. They need supplies like protective gear, they need swabs, they need logistical supports. Other states only need a fraction of that. They may have all the personnel, but they really need the knowhow, the template, and some of the gear that we provide. We are going to start implementing this system this week in a number of states, primarily those that are the hardest hit right now or are on the rise and the CDC has advised us that that’s when they need the testing.
Admiral Giroir: (24:48)
I want to emphasize again that we’re focusing on two very important groups. And you’ll hear this said three or four different ways. And the groups that really can be the most impacted or impactful in our outbreak. Number one, is healthcare workers and first responders. This is very important for two reasons. Number one, we have to take care of the healthcare workers in responders because when America needs them, they need to be available, healthy, to provide the care that we all deserve. But it’s also important that if they feel they have a risk of having contacted coronavirus, that we test them so they cannot spread that, for example in longterm care facilities where the elderly are.
Admiral Giroir: (25:29)
And the second group would be the elderly. And we are classifying that according to risk as those 65 years of age or older, who have a respiratory symptom and a fever of 99.6. That’s a lower number than you’ve seen before, because those who are older do not spike high fevers like children do, 104, 105, so you set the bar just a little bit lower. We do that because we know that they are high risk of bad consequences. And if they test positive, they can engage with their practitioner or tell a health provider, or get in the system to make sure they have a just an outstanding outcome.
Admiral Giroir: (26:06)
So that is really where we are. We’ve made really unprecedented progress. You will see these sites rolling out progressively over the week. This is not make believe, this is not fantasy. We’ve developed a model, we’ve talked to the states, we’re focusing in on specific locations now. We will start shipping gear stuff tomorrow. We will start deploying officers tomorrow and Tuesday, and we’ll begin seeing these sites in addition to the ones that are springing up now implemented during this week. We will have the capability of testing tens of thousands of additional people through these sites every week in addition to all the capability that’s now going to be distributed in the 2000 laboratories in the major central core laboratories.
Admiral Giroir: (26:54)
And I know you have a number of questions that hopefully in the question and answer session we’ll be able to answer for you. But I think this is just a great linkage. I’m a pediatric ICU doctor. I take care of sick people. I know what happens when you get respiratory illness. The surgeon general is an anesthesiologist who takes care of people who have respiratory difficulties and manages that. So we know how this works. We’ve been there. The most important thing we’ve worked on right now is making testing accessible because of the advances of the FDA and private industry to make these high throughput tests. Now we can work on the front end with the emergency declaration.
Admiral Giroir: (27:30)
We have all the tools and all of government has really come together with industry, not just government and states. It’s really been private industry, the manufacturers to bring the swabs, the personal protective gear, the laboratory testing, the shipping, the fronts with Walgreens and Walmarts working as potential sites. This has been something in my mind has been unprecedented the entire society approach working so intensely over the past, certainly over the past weeks but incredibly on this project over the past 72 hours.
Vice President Pence: (28:03)
Thank you, Admiral. And let me say we are moving out now that we have the public private partnership with the major commercial labs, and now you have our public health team as well as FEMA moving out, connecting to the states to deploy these point of distribution community centers. We’ll also be working closely with members of the media and individual jurisdictions, as well as we’re working with Google and other tech companies to make sure that there’s online resources where people will be able to readily access a questionnaire that will walk them through the symptoms, and whether or not a test might be indicated. And also in the days ahead, we look forward to that same website being able to direct people to the nearest community center or drive through center that’s available.
Vice President Pence: (28:54)
But me let me introduce Dr. Deborah Birx to speak about that patient experience, and about the importance of the right people seeking the testing in the days ahead. Doctor.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (29:07)
Thank you Mr. Vice President. Let me just start by recognizing the men and women of the military who are serving us every day, they are my brothers and sisters. I was privileged to serve alongside them for quite a long time. But critically, I just want to recognize at this moment the public health Commission Corps behind me. The Vice President, although he didn’t speak to this, actually went to see them yesterday at the place where they were working so that we wouldn’t disturb them because of their level of dedication and work through the last really 48 hours nonstop. So thank you. Thank you for your work and thank you for the work that you brought together and thank you Admiral for explaining it so quickly.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (29:49)
Let me just go back to the way laboratory work is done in the United States. I think all of you know when you go to your doctor and you need a lab test, it is either done in your doctor’s office, or it’s done in the lab that they send you to. When we started this emergency response to this virus, we started with what we knew, and that was the flu platform that we use for surveillance. It wasn’t set up in your doctors office, it wasn’t set up in our hospital laboratories. It was set up in state and local labs and at the CDC. Over the last two weeks, we’ve been working with the groups that have served you for decades.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (30:29)
The commercial laboratories that you don’t see, but your specimen goes to, to ensure they had the full capacity to meet the needs of the American people. Because it wasn’t going to be 50 to 100 to 1000 tests. It was going to be tens of thousands of tests that would be needed to be done. And so the last two weeks has been spent on really getting what you are used to the full force of the clinical laboratories and service. At the same time, what you heard described here is how do we serve the needs of the people in the community where they reside, where we know when we’re talking about people with vulnerable conditions, immunosuppression, medical conditions, or the elderly, that we don’t want them having to sit for long times in doctor’s office, in hospitals’ waiting rooms.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (31:15)
And you see what state and local governors have done to move past what we would normally do, a referral to your doctor’s office, into your hospital, but really providing community-led services to provide this testing. What the federal government is doing is augmenting that, augmenting the innovation that existed in South Korea, brought here to the shores of the United States and broaden our own novel way, but utilizing our healthcare delivery system, which is different than South Korea, and adapting our work to our system.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (31:50)
So to the hospitals and to the laboratories, we know that there will be pent up demand for this. Make sure every hospital, every laboratory, I’m speaking to the people who work in labs like I did myself. Make sure you have enough pipette tips, pipetters, and all of the equipment that you need to run this laboratory. You know what you need. Make sure you have that, and have that available for these tests. Because we know with this increased sampling, this increase ability to have community access, additional samples will be going to these laboratories. They can manage the high throughput, but they need all of the supplies that they would normally need to run these tests.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (32:31)
Think of it, if you’re doing HIV viral load, same thing. Just what you need, you know what you need, make sure you have that. That will be run, and the most important thing, I know for each and every one of you, is how am I going to get my results? And so we’re making sure also that the end of reporting is also there, that the reporting is available to you, to your doctor, and also to the state and local governments and the federal government, not with your personal identifiers but to really understand where there are positives, where there are negatives, so we can assure that healthcare providers have what they need to meet the demands of the American people and their health needs when they’re there.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (33:13)
Now, let me just say one bit about reporting. So you will notice as these tests roll out over this next week, we will have a spike in our curve. For those of you who watched China and China reporting, remember when they changed their definition and all of a sudden there was a blip in their curve? We are going to see that. We are going to see a spike as more and more people have access. And I want to finish by again reminding people how important it is. I know everybody’s going to want to go to these drive throughs, but if we could prioritize like we have asked you to prioritize the care of every person with a preexisting condition and immunosuppression, and the elderly with existing conditions.
Dr. Deborah Birx: (33:54)
We’ve asked you to prioritize them and we ask you to prioritize them in the lines. So that our first responders, and our healthcare providers, and everybody who has difficulty to get to doctor’s offices can utilize this system while we bring all the other traditional systems that you are used to, and have availability for you online over the next few days and weeks. So thank you. Thank you for constantly reminding us how important it’s a response of all of America for Americans. All of America, for Americans. It’s a privilege to be part of this solution and be part of this team. And again, I want to close by recognizing the Commission Corps. I’m not sure they had anything but pizza to eat for the last two days… Donuts. All right. Don’t follow their guidance.
Vice President Pence: (34:48)
Dr. Fauci.
Dr. Fauci: (34:51)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President. I’ll be very brief. I just want to say listening to the description of Admiral Giroir, I’m very pleased to see how things have evolved. I think we could describe this as entering into a new phase in the testing space available here in the United States. You’ve heard me on many of these briefings talk about the multifaceted armamentarium that we have to address the crisis of what the world is seeing, and the challenge that we’re seeing right here in the United States. I mean, obviously, the travel restrictions have been in my mind a very, very positive way that we have prevented more of the input from outside in that would seat us and make our job more difficult.
Dr. Fauci: (35:36)
And then we have, as I’ve mentioned, the containment and the mitigation from within. You’re going to be hearing more about advanced guidelines about that more precise instructions of how we can implement this mitigation within the community. But now that we have a situation that is going to be rolled out, and remember, I want to emphasize what was just said. We’re not going to go from here to there overnight. It’s going to be a gradual ratcheting up that I believe is going to happen quickly, so that then we can start talking about things and put behind us the multiple, multiple understandable questions about testing and move on to see how we can make this multifaceted approach really work for us.
Dr. Fauci: (36:16)
Because as I’ve said many times, and I’ll repeat it, the worst is ahead for us. It is how we respond to that challenge that’s going to determine what the ultimate end point is going to be. We have a very, very critical point now. If you look at the curves that I’ve described multiple, multiple times, this window that we’re in is going to be very important for us to stay ahead of this curve. Thank you.
Vice President Pence: (36:44)
Questions? Yes.
Speaker 1: (36:48)
Mr. Vice President, we’ve seen a number of communities across the country that are starting to either close restaurants, some are even doing curfews. Do you envision this happening kind of nationwide where you’ll see some rules come to affect saying, “We don’t want people out at places they’re not… Essentially a Walmart or a grocery store of some kind or a testing center?” And then also I would be curious to see, we’ve also heard so many travelers today that were coming back from these airports, people that were flying back. They were so concerned, I’m sure the Secretary will address it, but these folks that are wondering now, did they catch it because they were stuck waiting in line for hours and hours of customs? Your thoughts on that, sir?
Vice President Pence: (37:22)
Well, we will have updated guidelines tomorrow morning for you that are being vetted now with CDC and all of our top healthcare experts. But what I would just recommend to the American people is to review those federal guidelines, and know that we’ll also respect and defer to decisions that are made by governors, by state health departments about what’s best for that community. What my healthcare team, some of the best people in the world, tell me very regularly, is that it’s very important that you follow the data. And you make decisions based on the circumstances that are taking place in that community. But we’ll have more broad based recommendations for the American public tomorrow. And let me say, I’m going to ask the Secretary to come up and speak about the screening issue. The president made a decision to suspend all travel from Europe. That is underway now, and as of midnight Monday night, we will be suspending all travel from the UK and Ireland as well. But Americans may come home. But out of an abundance of caution, we are engaging in healthcare screenings at 13 different airports around the country and working diligently in that regard to put the safety of the American public first. And we’re asking returning Americans to self quarantine for 14 days if they’ve been in those countries in Europe. And as of Monday, the UK and Ireland that are being impacted by the Coronavirus. But the Secretary and I spoke this morning, I spoke with Governor Pritzker and Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois this morning about some challenges at O’Hare airport, and I’m going to let the Secretary speak to how we are addressing those going forward. Mr. Secretary.
Secretary Chad Wolf: (39:21)
Well, yesterday we began processing again the travel restrictions from passengers from the Shingon area, which totaled more than 40,000 passengers yesterday. So to give you an idea, in one day, we processed over half of the total number of individuals we have processed medical screening since February 2nd. So that is an enormous challenge that we have placed on our officers and contract medical staff at airports, and they are stepping up. But to be clear, the lines again that we saw overnight at a limited number of airports, including Chicago, are unacceptable. Acting Commissioner, CVP Commissioner Morgan also believes they’re unacceptable and has personally engaged leadership at all 13 funneling airports. We did make the necessary adjustments at 12 of the funneling airports.
Secretary Chad Wolf: (40:03)
We did make the necessary adjustments at 12 of the funneling airports. However, again, at Chicago those adjustments were not made quick enough, but we have course corrected. We’ve adjusted our processes, we continue to surge personnel, and we are certainly glad to see certain airports and certain airlines step up, partner with us and help address this unprecedented situation.
Secretary Chad Wolf: (40:21)
As I walked in here today, so far today at all of our funneling airports to include Chicago, we have an average wait time of 30 minutes. So we addressed the problem, we identified the problem, addressed it and we have fixed it and we look forward to, again, accommodating passengers this evening as well. I understand the frustration that some passengers who are returning to the US might have with some of these procedures, but I would just say, and rest assure, that we are continuing our strict protocols of looking at individuals as they come into the country, make sure that they are medically screened, make sure that we are capturing the information for the public health officials, the state and local officials, and we’ll continue to do that. And we’ve done that specifically at the President’s request. Thank you.
Reporter: (41:07)
Mr. Secretary, has there been any talk, sir, of any sort of shutdown of domestic air travel at all?
Secretary Chad Wolf: (41:12)
Well, we continue to look at all options and all options remain on the table to address, and we’ll certainly adjust as the medical professionals at CDC address the medical situation.
Vice President Pence: (41:21)
Very good. Good job.
Reporter: (41:26)
Mr. Vice President, Dr. Fauci this morning said that the federal government should do whatever it takes to increase Americans’ social distancing and encourage that practice. He didn’t rule out the possibility of a national lockdown. If Americans don’t take those steps on their own, is that something that the federal government is prepared to do? And secondly, I’d also like to know, the President, we just heard him say Americans should relax. Why aren’t we hearing more from him about what Americans can do as they are seeing this huge impact on their daily lives, whether it’s at airports or at restaurants or other places around the country?
Vice President Pence: (42:05)
Well, everything that the White House Coronavirus Task Force does is at the direction of the President of the United States. All the efforts of all federal agencies and cooperation with state governments and local health officials is reflective of the decisive leadership the President has brought this early on. It’s important to remember that the President on January 31st suspended all travel from China.
Vice President Pence: (42:35)
I said to Dr. Fauci who I’ll call up to address your other question in a moment. I said to Dr. Fauci today, as we look at Europe now being the epicenter of the coronavirus, I asked him if we had not suspended all travel from China, what our circumstance would be, and he essentially said we’d be where Europe is today.
Vice President Pence: (42:58)
And the President also the actions with regard to Europe and recently expanded those. So the American people can be confident that President Trump is going to continue to act without hesitation on the advice of our healthcare professionals to put the health and safety of the American people first. But with regard to the statement that you made, I’m going to let Dr. Fauci address that as well.
Dr. Fauci: (43:22)
Yeah, I meant everything I said this morning on the shows, that really to protect the American people we’ll consider anything and everything on the table. You’re going to see some advanced and updated guidelines tomorrow. They’re going to address some but not all of the questions and concerns. But on a day by day basis we look at this and literally we will do everything that we can to make sure we safeguard the health and the wellbeing of the American people, and that means everything and anything we’ll consider.
Reporter: (43:51)
Could we continue for Dr. Fauci, could you give us some examples? You say anything, everything. Like what?
Dr. Fauci: (44:01)
Like-
Reporter: (44:02)
Like what Europe is doing? No bars, no restaurants-
Dr. Fauci: (44:05)
That could be, absolutely. I mean that could be.
Reporter: (44:08)
But if new guidance is coming tomorrow, can you give us a more concrete idea right now?
Dr. Fauci: (44:11)
I don’t want-
Reporter: (44:11)
You must know what it is.
Dr. Fauci: (44:12)
No, what I don’t want to do, is I don’t want to jump ahead of the guidance. I promise you, let the guidance come out. We’ll be here every day. I’ll answer the question after the guidance. I promise you. Okay.
Reporter: (44:21)
Mr. Vice President, how will people know where to get their test?
Reporter: (44:28)
Mr. Vice President, what is your plan to build more hospital beds so tens of thousand Americans don’t die, and how many more ventilators are you looking at ordering so people don’t suffocate?
Vice President Pence: (44:38)
Let me let the secretary step up. I know that there’s a longterm planning that takes place at HHS for those circumstances, and when I traveled to HHS yesterday, we reviewed all the numbers about stockpiles, everything from masks to ventilators to gowns. Mr. Secretary, you might just speak about capacity issues. And let me say it’s a very good question on your part. Right now our focus as the White House Coronavirus Task Force is to have widespread testing across the country using this new partnership with our commercial labs that the president has forged, and work with states to make those tests available. We’re also going to continue to work every single day to promote best practices for mitigation and working closely with and supporting state governments for decisions that they’re making on mitigation to prevent the spread. But the whole issue of personal protective equipment and supplies and the capacity of our healthcare system is in the forefront of what we’re talking about every day and the Secretary can address it.
Alex Azar: (45:47)
Thank you very much. First, being here at the podium, I just want to especially talk about the people in blue behind me. These are the leaders of United States Public Health Service Commission Corps that I am incredibly privileged to lead. Over 3000 of them, America’s public health warriors. Whether it’s going into the Eastern Congo or Western Africa to fight Ebola, or if it’s staffing the nursing home in Kirkland, being on the World Health Organization team in China, or helping to facilitate community based testing, these are America’s public health heroes. They rarely, in fact I doubt that there’s ever been a time in American history where the leadership of the Public Health Service Commission Corps had the privilege of standing here on this stage behind the President and Vice President of the United States. I just wanted to commend that.
Alex Azar: (46:36)
In terms of our capacities in our healthcare system, any pandemic like this runs the risk of exceeding our healthcare system capacity, and we must acknowledge that. That is precisely why the President and Vice President’s strategy is as Dr. Fauci has repeatedly spoke, to a delay and flatten the curve. The point of this is instead of a spike of the curve to delay and flatten that curve with the hope that you can keep the utilization of resources to be within the healthcare systems capacities. In addition to that, the entire point of our pandemic planning over the last 15 years has been to grant and put extra flex into our healthcare system. That’s why we have hospital preparedness grants that we fund every year through our preparedness program. That’s why we have in our strategic national stockpile, ventilators, field hospital units like mash units, if you’ll remember those, that have capacity for hundreds of individuals. In terms of supplies, obviously this is an unprecedented challenge. Unprecedented. And so we will work to increase the supplies of personal protective equipment, of ventilators, of field medical unit hospitals that we can deploy. We have tremendous supplies, but we want to acquire more. And that’s thanks to the bipartisan work of Congress funding the emergency supplemental that gives us the money to scale up production here and abroad. And we’re doing that.
Alex Azar: (48:21)
We don’t disclose concrete numbers on particular items for national security purposes, but we have many ventilators, thousands and thousands of ventilators in our system. We have received so far only, I think, one request for just several ventilators. One of the things in terms of hospital capacity that’s going to be really important, this is a really good learning from China that we got from the World Health Organization team that went there. Is if we have communities where we have enough capacity where we can put people who are positive with COVID-19 and have them be exclusively reserved for individuals who are positive for COVID-19, this reduces our need to try to protect patients from other patients because they’re all positive already.
Alex Azar: (49:07)
We need to protect our healthcare workers and our service workers in those facilities. This gives us reduced burden on personal protective equipment, but it also can give us greater capacity as we put field medical shelters up, as we consolidate into single facilities, as we don’t need individual rooms, negative airflow, isolation, et cetera. A vastly more efficient utilization of our healthcare system. This is all part of the planning work that we’ve done and are promulgating throughout our healthcare system. So that’s our strategy. We’re going to keep building that capacity though.
Vice President Pence: (49:37)
Very good. Thank you, Mr. Secretary.
Reporter: (49:38)
Mr. Vice President, [crosstalk 00:49:41] using the military?
Vice President Pence: (49:42)
Go ahead.
Reporter: (49:44)
Mr Vice President, you talked briefly about trying to make information more accessible online, so can you give us a time table for when you think a website will be available based on your conversations with Google? And secondly, and this might be to the broader team, can you also talk specifically about how many of these tests have been sent out to states and how many you still have to send out?
Vice President Pence: (50:08)
Well, let me say that we’re working with Google, but we’re working with many other tech companies and we’re truly grateful for the efforts of tech companies in disseminating best practices and guidance for citizens online all over the country today. Those resources are available in it. We literally heard not only from Google, but from Facebook and Amazon, and the public spiritedness that’s been reflected there is a credit to those great companies and a credit to all the dedicated Americans who worked there.
Vice President Pence: (50:43)
Our best estimate, and literally the team has been working around the clock since Friday, is that at some point early in the week that we will have a website that goes up, the purpose of which will be for people to go and first fill out a questionnaire so that they can identify whether they fall in the category that Dr. Burks described would indicate the need to have a test. And then once they go through that questionnaire, then our objective is as more and more of these sites come online, run by state governments working in cooperation with our team, our public health service team, and FEMA, and also working in cooperation with local businesses and retailers, that people will know how to not only find it, but also the objective would be for them to literally be given a time that they can go and report for the test. But let me let the Admiral speak to the timing on the testing and unpack that for you.
Admiral Giroir: (51:45)
So in our design, I just want to emphasize, we talk about testing and we talk about so many things, but we’re really talking people. And we’re trying to make this a very person centric experience to easily access the system, to give clear guidance about how to go, when to go, information that even if you’re not really indicated for testing, information you need to help protect yourself and your family. And then on the back end, very customized reporting. And we’re talking literally about having telephonic services to call individuals who’ve been tested, let them know yes, no, and what the next steps are.
Admiral Giroir: (52:24)
So we’ve tried to really envision this through a patient experience. Now let me talk about the testing. Progressively over this week there will be rollout to different laboratories of approximately 1.9 million tests. There are many centralized laboratories, the behind the curtain that you never see after you give your blood. And you saw some of the CEOs in the Rose Garden last week like Quest and LabCorp that are fully able ready to run. They have been testing already, but fully able ready to run within the first part of this week, the very high throughput testing. The 2000 laboratories that are around the country that have a different platform, one that’s amenable to so many labs, not the big hugest highest output, but very high throughput laboratories, are progressing. They have to adapt the test slightly to their machines and get used to this. They will start lighting up Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. I can’t give you the precise timeline except it has been an absolute priority of the laboratory associations of Thermo Fisher, the company that made this test, you heard the President predict that it might be approved within 24 hours on Friday. I think it was five hours after that in the middle of the night that the FDA approved that. And that’s the one that’s going to be widely disseminated, high throughput that’s going to be available.
Admiral Giroir: (53:50)
So I know you want a specific time when these will light up progressively over the week. When that happens, there will be a centralized opportunity like in the Quest and the LabCorp. There will also be distributed opportunities like in all the major hospital systems and labs that are in your area. And then that number of 1.9 million goes up dramatically in the weeks coming forward. I’m not going to say that the lab testing issue is over because it’s not, it’s entering the next phase, but the much higher priority now is now that we have the testing available, how do we get people into the system to be tested in the appropriate prioritized way? And that’s what we’ve really been focused on. Information, website, points of distribution model that are tried and true, enabling the states, providing them with equipment, supplies, know how and Commission Corps officers as needed to help man these, or staff these, as we move forward. So you’ll see this rapidly developing over the week.
Speaker 3: (54:50)
All right guys, last question.
Reporter: (54:51)
Mr. Vice President, are you considering domestic travel restrictions, sir?
Reporter: (54:55)
Mr. Vice President, market futures are down despite the dramatic move from the fed that the President applauded, which suggests that there’s still concern that we haven’t done enough to respond to the economic impact of this deal… Or of the coronavirus. I’m wondering when specifically we’re going to hear from the White House about how you’re going help impacted industries from the airlines, the cruise ships? And secondly, I wanted to talk about the legislation that came out. The White House fought to exclude workers at larger corporations from paid sick leave. And so I’m wondering what you say to somebody who flips burgers at McDonald’s or works at one of these large chains that’s worried about staying home and potentially missing a paycheck?
Vice President Pence: (55:41)
Well first let me say we strongly support the House legislation, which while it gives some flexibility to small businesses, which will be reflected in the regulations going forward, no American workers should worry about missing a paycheck if they’re feeling ill. And we can’t say often enough to our fellow Americans, if you’re sick with a respiratory ailment, stay home. And as you’ve heard here today, over the course of this next week, we’re going to see testing become much more widely available beginning in the areas the CDC will focus us as the highest priority. But working with members of Congress, we’ve made sure that not only is testing free, but we have every confidence that the extension of paid and family leave to Americans will be extended in a way that will… Should give every American that confidence.
Vice President Pence: (56:46)
And let me say with regard to the economy as a whole, I think the Treasury Secretary and then working very diligently on the President’s behalf, we have the supplemental eight point $3 billion bill. The House has now acted on important legislation that we fully support, and we hope the Senate takes it up this week. But whether it be the airline industry, or the cruise line industry, or the hotel industry, as the Secretary said recently, we are in just the first few innings of this effort. And the President has directed us to bring the full weight of the federal government to bear to confront this crisis, first and foremost on behalf of the health and safety and the American public, but strengthening our economy, ensuring that those vital industries will be able to find their way through and grow strongly once this coronavirus has passed will be a priority.
Vice President Pence: (57:43)
And we’re already in discussions with members of Congress in both parties about that next phase of the support. But let me say as I close, we will be back in the morning tomorrow for a briefing, and also we’ll have a health briefing in the afternoon. But again, I know I speak on behalf of the President when I say how grateful we are for all the governors in the country, for all the local health officials, everyone that’s coming alongside Americans. We encourage every American to continue to use best practices and common sense. Even if you’re not in a high risk category, as the vast majority of Americans are, remember those people around you who may well be. Remember those seniors with underlying health conditions.
Vice President Pence: (58:36)
It’s the reason why you need to keep washing your hands. You need to keep practicing good hygiene, cleaning those counters and surfaces to make sure that we don’t convey the coronavirus to them. And finally, let me add to all the wonderful accolades of the public health service personnel behind me. These are all heroes. And I have to tell you, having been over at HHS yesterday, having seen the way these people dropped everything and are rolling into this effort to expand testing across the country, it’ll be these people in these blue uniforms that you see at an awful lot of these points of distribution, these community centers around the country. And for all they’re doing today, for all each one of them done throughout their career. I know they have the thanks of this President, his Vice President, and the American people. Thank you."
"Mar 13, 2020",6:37 P.M. EST,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
To unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today, I am officially declaring a National Emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to 50 billion dollars of very important and a large amount of money for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.
Donald Trump: (00:28)
In furtherance of the order, I’m urging every state to set up emergency operation centers effective immediately. You’re going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world. They’re standing right behind me and the side of me. I’m also asking every hospital in this country to activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the needs of Americans everywhere. The hospitals are very engaged. New York and various other places are also various engaged. I just spoke with governor Cuomo. We had a very good conversation and we’re working very strongly with the many states including New York.
Donald Trump: (01:11)
The urgency orders I’m issuing today will also confer broad new authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of HHS will be able to immediately wave revisions of applicable laws and regulations to give doctors, hospital all hospitals and healthcare providers, maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and care for patients. This includes the following critical authorities, the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that’s happened in the not so distant past. I tell you what they’ve done with telehealth has incredible. It gives remote doctors visits and hospital check-ins the power to waive certain federal license requirements so that doctors from other states can provide services in states with the greatest need.
Donald Trump: (02:12)
Number two, the ability to waive requirements that critical access hospitals limit the number of beds to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hours. The ability to waive the requirements of a three day hospital stay prior to admission to a nursing home; big thing. The authority to waive rules to hinder hospital’s ability to bring additional physicians on board or obtain needed office space. They can do as they want. They can do what they have to do. They know what they have to do. Now they don’t have any problem getting it done.
Donald Trump: (02:51)
The authority to waive rules that severely restrict where hospitals can care for patients within the hospital itself. Ensuring that the emergency capacity can be quickly established. We’ll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they’re entitled to. No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever. 10 days ago, I brought together the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on the solution to dramatically increase the availability of tests.
Donald Trump: (03:30)
Other countries have called us and worked with us and they’re doing similar things or will be doing similar things as a result of that action. Today we are announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the Coronavirus. We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly and conveniently but we don’t want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it and we don’t want everyone running out and taking; only if you have certain symptoms.
Donald Trump: (00:00)
Using federal emergency authorities, the FDA approved a new test for the virus. We did this within hours after receiving the application from Roche, a process that would normally take weeks. We therefore expect up to a half a million additional tests will be available early next week. We’ll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night. I want to thank Roche, great company for their incredible work. I’d also like to thank Thermo Fisher. The FDA’s goal is to hopefully authorize your application within 24 hours. It’ll go very quickly. It’s going very quickly. Which will bring additionally 1.4 million tests on board next week and five million within a month. I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.
Donald Trump: (00:47)
At the same time, we’ve been in discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in the critical locations identified by public health professionals. The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car. I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. And we have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover this country and large parts of the world, by the way. We’re not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country.
Donald Trump: (01:39)
Stores in virtually every location. Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They’ve made tremendous progress. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this. Again, we don’t want everybody taking this test. It’s totally unnecessary. And this will pass. This will pass through and we’re going to be even stronger for it. We’ve learned a lot, a tremendous amount has been learned. I want to thank Deborah Birx and I want to ask her maybe to come up and say a few words as to what’s happening. Dr. Birx is a highly respected person. I’ve gotten to know her very well over the last six days and what we’ve done is we built something that was very old, very old fashioned, somewhat obsolete, certainly obsolete when it comes to the kind of numbers that we’re talking about. Dr. Birx, please. Thank you, Deborah.
Deborah Birx: (02:47)
Thank you, Mr. President. It’s a pleasure to be here with all of you. I think you know at the beginning of this epidemic, HHS through CDC proactively developed an assay, built on the existing flu surveillance system. That surveillance system was then converted to diagnostic system. But last Tuesday, seeing the spread of the virus around the globe, the President realized that our current approach to testing was inadequate to meet the needs of the American public. He asked for an entire overhaul of the testing approach. He immediately called the private sector laboratories to the White House, as noted, and charged them with developing a high throughput quality platform that can meet the needs of the American public.
Deborah Birx: (03:33)
We are grateful to LabCorp and Quest for taking up the charge immediately after the meeting and within 72 hours, bringing additional testing access, particularly to the outbreak areas of Washington State and California and now across the country. We are also very grateful to the universities and large hospital systems that took up the charge to develop their own quality tests made available by new FDA guidance. This has resolved and expanded testing across New York, California, Washington, Colorado, and you see sometimes those drive-through options that have been made available through these high throughput options.
Deborah Birx: (04:10)
Following the meeting last week, major commercial laboratory equipment and diagnostic companies took immediate action to adopt and develop new testing systems. Last night, the initial company, Roche, received FDA approval, moving from request, to development, to approval in record time. This innovative approach centered fully on unleashing the power of the private sector, focusing on providing convenient testing to hundreds of thousands of Americans within short turnaround times. In less than two weeks together, we have developed a solution that we believe will meet the future testing needs of Americans. I understand how difficult this has been. I was part of the HIV/AIDS response in the 80s.
Deborah Birx: (04:56)
We knew from first finding cases in 1981, it took us to almost 1985 to have a test. It took us another 11 years to have effective therapy. It is because of the lessons learned from that, that we were able to mobilize and bring those individuals that were key to the HIV response to this response. I understand that a lot of this behind the scenes action over the last couple of weeks was invisible to the press and the American people, but this intense effort has not only resulted in innovative solutions, but an automated high throughput system bringing the availability of these quality corona-viral testing to the American people at unprecedented speed.
Deborah Birx: (05:43)
Finally, I want you to know in South Korea, they did have a large number of tests available over the last several weeks. Their positivity rate is between three and 4%. With LabCorp and Quest expanded testing, their positivity rate is between one and 2%. So we want to also announce this new approach to testing, which we’ll start in this screening website up here facilitated by Google, where clients and patients and people of interest can go, fill out a screening questionnaire, move down for symptoms or risk factors. Yes, they would move down this and be told where the drive-through options would be for them to receive this test. The labs will then move to the high throughput automated machines to be able to provide results in 24 to 36 hours. That is the intent of this approach. We have seen it work just in our own United States and we want to bring this across the continent. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (06:48)
Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:06:49]. I’d like to maybe have, Tony, do you want to come up? You’ve become a … I think everybody out here knows you pretty well, but Tony has been doing a tremendous job working long, long hours and you’ve seen a lot happen, but this has been … It’s been a great experience and working with you has been terrific. Tony, please.
Mike Pence: (07:10)
Hold the mic down [inaudible 00:07:11].
Tony Fauci: (07:13)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. This is an example of another example of what I’ve been referring to in my discussions with many of you in the audience as a proactive leaning forward, aggressive, trying to stay ahead of the curve. And what you’ve seen now with this order is that we’re going to be able to remove the constraints so that people at the state, the local level, the individual physician, all the way up through the federal government will have as many constraints as possible, removed for them to do everything they possibly can so that we can implement the things that we’ve been talking about.
Tony Fauci: (07:52)
The containment, the mitigation, so that as I’ve said, many times, that curve that I refer to that goes up. We don’t want to have that curve. We want to suppress it down to that small mound and I think what we’ve done today is something that is going to be a very important element in having us be successful in doing that. We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases, but we’ll take care of that. And ultimately, as the President said, this will end, but what’s going on here today is going to help it to end sooner than it would have. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (08:26)
Thank you very much, Tony. If I could, some of these folks, we know they’re celebrities in their own right. They’re the biggest business people, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world, and one of them is Doug McMillon from Walmart and I’d like to have Doug, if you would say a few words wherever you may be. [inaudible 00:08:46] Doug, please.
Doug McMillon: (08:48)
When we got the call yesterday from the White House, we were eager to do our part to help serve the country. And given what we’re facing, that’s certainly important to do. We should all be doing that. So we’ve been asked to make portions of our parking lot available in select locations in the beginning and scaling over time as supply increases so that people can experience the drive-through experience that the President described. We’ll stay involved and do everything we can from a supply chain point of view to be of assistance. Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (09:11)
Thank you very much, Doug. Appreciate it very much. I’ll just stay right over here, and Richard, if you could come up please. Richard, please. Walgreens. Thank you.
Richard Ashworth: (09:21)
Yep. Thank you, Mr. President. And similar to Doug and Walmart, we’re happy to stand in here and help in communities all across America, because a lot of times when we have natural disasters, our stores are a beacon in the community and this situation is no different. So we look forward to partnering with the CDC, the administration, HHS, and the taskforce and specifically to the Vice President’s doing such a fantastic job. We’re ready to engage and help. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (09:46)
Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you very much. Brian Cornell, Target. Thank you, Brian. Thank you. Please.
Brian Cornell: (09:56)
Well, Mr. President, thank you for inviting us here today along with our colleagues from Walmart, and Walgreens, and our partners at CVS. Normally, you’d view us as competitors, but today we’re focused on a common competitor and that’s defeating the spread of the coronavirus. And we look forward to working with the administration to do our fair share to alleviate this growing threat. So thank you for including us today. In the near term, we’re all committed to making sure we’re keeping our stores open to serve the American consumer who’s rapidly stocking up on household essentials, key food and beverage items that they need during this time. Making sure we run safe stores and create an environment that’s safe for our team members, making sure that they feel supported during this very critical time. So thank you for including us.
Donald Trump: (10:42)
Thank you very much. Great job.
Mike Pence: (10:43)
Great job.
Donald Trump: (10:45)
Is Tom here? Tom Polen. Tom? Tom Polen, please.
Tom Polen: (10:50)
Thank you, Mr. President. As a CEO of Becton Dickinson, we’re one of the leading providers of medical devices as well as collection products for testing of coronavirus. We were ramping up our manufacturing capacity to ensure that the right collection devices and testing equipment are ready to address this issue. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (11:07)
Thank you very much, Tom. Great job you’ve done. [Steven Rakowski 00:00:11:10], Quest Diagnostics. Please. Great job. Thank you very much.
Steven Rakowski: (11:17)
Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President. So as mentioned, we were called through the leadership of the Vice President last week to come together as an industry and we took advantage of that opportunity to work with the FDA, to work with the Center for Disease Control and we were up and running with tests in a number of our facilities. As the President mentioned, we now have capabilities from Roche Diagnostics that we will bring into our facilities this weekend. And I know myself and as my colleague at LabCorp will be doing the same. So the capacity available to the American public to support this action with consumers will be considerably increased in the next few weeks. Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (11:56)
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Mike Pence: (11:57)
Thanks.
Donald Trump: (11:58)
And Matt Sause, please, of Roche. Matt. Thank you, Matt.
Matt Sause: (12:04)
Thank you, Mr. President. So from Roche, we want to thank the FDA for their rapid approval of our coronavirus test. We really appreciate the partnership with the CDC and the FDA to get that to market as fast as possible, because it’s critical for us to make that available to help patients in need and working with laboratories to get it up and going in the near future, which will bring hundreds of thousands of tests available to patients in need in the United States. So thank you.
Donald Trump: (12:33)
And you can do it. You can do it.
Mike Pence: (12:35)
You can.
Donald Trump: (12:35)
You’re a great company. David Pierre of Signify. Signify Health, please. Excellent.
David Pierre: (12:41)
Great. Thank you, Mr. President. We are the largest house call provider in the US and we go to the homes of the most vulnerable elderly and through our network and our logistics engine, we stand ready to help and provide our clinicians to be where they’re needed, whether they’re in retail clinics or in the home. And we’re here to assist. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (13:05)
Thank you very much. And we’ll be changing a lot of the rules, regulations for future should this happen in the future, which we hope it never does, but it will, I guess, somewhere out there. We had some bad ones over the years and I guess that’ll continue to an extent, but we hope it never happens. But we are going to be changing a lot of the old rules and specifications and regulations. Adam Schechter, who’s really been of tremendous help. LabCorp, please. Adam.
Adam Schechter: (13:38)
Thank you, Mr. President. At LabCorp, we’re working every second of every day to increase the number of tests that we can run. We’re working with academic medical centers, with our colleagues at Quest, with other hospital and other laboratories to ensure that we do everything we can to increase the testing as we move forward. And I can tell you, we understand how important the testing is and we are committed to doing everything possible.
Donald Trump: (14:00)
Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you.
Mike Pence: (14:02)
Great.
Donald Trump: (14:03)
Thomas Moriarty, CVS. We all know CVS. Thank you.
Thomas Moriarty: (14:08)
Thanks.
Donald Trump: (14:09)
Thank you, Thomas.
Thomas Moriarty: (14:09)
Thank you, Mr. President. We have been focused since the start of making sure our patients and the customers we serve have the information they need, the safety they need as well. We are committed to working with the administration and local public health officials to make this work as well. And thank you sir for the honor.
Donald Trump: (14:27)
Thank you very much.
Thomas Moriarty: (14:28)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (14:29)
Thanks. Great job. And Bruce Greenstein, LHC Group. Tremendously talented people. Thank you very much.
Bruce Greenstein: (14:38)
Mr. President, thank you for the honor of being here. And the home health industry has been treating patients and seniors in the safety and comfort of their own home for decades. We’re very proud to be part of the equation for testing in their own home. For Americans that can’t get to a test site or live in rural areas far away from a retail establishment, we’re here to help and to partner with our hospitals and physicians as well as the people we have here today that will be doing testing around the country. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (15:03)
Thanks very much. [crosstalk 00:15:02].
Bruce Greenstein: (15:03)
We’ll practice that.
Donald Trump: (15:06)
Okay. I like that. That’s good. We’re also announcing the following emergency executive actions today. To help our students and their families, I’ve waived interest in all student loans held by the federal government agencies and that will be until further notice. That’s a big thing for a lot of students that are left in the middle right now. Many of those schools have been closed. Based on the price of oil, I’ve also instructed the Secretary of Energy to purchase, at a very good price, large quantities of crude oil for storage in the US, strategic reserve.
Donald Trump: (15:44)
We’re going to fill it right up to the top, saving the American taxpayer billions and billions of dollars, helping our oil industry and making us even further toward that wonderful goal which we’ve achieved, which nobody thought was possible of energy independence. It puts us in a position that’s very strong and we’re buying it at the right price. And that’s something that would have not even been possible a week ago. The price of oil went down quite a bit, so we’re going to fill it up. It’s a good time to fill it up. I’d like to ask Mike Pence to say a few words please. VP.
Mike Pence: (16:23)
Thank you, Mr. President. This day should be an inspiration to every American, because thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole of government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we’re bringing an all of America approach. Mr. President, from early on you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China, you created travel advisories to South Korea and Italy. We screened all travelers from all airports in both of those countries. And on the unanimous recommendation of your health experts, you at midnight tonight will effectively suspend all travel from Europe and Americans that were returning will be screened and asked to voluntarily participate in a 14-day quarantine.
Mike Pence: (17:17)
Throughout this process, Mr. President, you’ve put the health of America first, but you brought the best of America to address it. And it’s not just at the federal level. As you said, Mr. President, we’ve been working with states across the country. We issued broad guidelines from the CDC for every American. But this week at your direction, we tailored specific recommendations from CDC for New York, Washington State, California, Massachusetts and Florida. And we’ve been in continuous contact, as you said, with governors around the country. Mr. President, you have forged a seamless partnership with every state and every territory in this country to put the health of our nation first.
Mike Pence: (17:59)
But today, I trust that people around the country that are looking on at this extraordinary public and private partnership to address the issue of testing with particular inspiration. After you tapped me to lead the White House Corona Taskforce, Mr. President, you said this is all hands on deck and you directed us to immediately reach out to the American business sector, commercial labs to meet what we knew then would be the need for testing across the spectrum. And today, with this historic public- private partnership, we have laid the foundation to meet that need. For Americans looking on, by this Sunday evening, we’ll be able to give specific guidance on when the website will be available.
Mike Pence: (18:42)
You can go to the website, as the President said. You’ll type in your symptoms and be given direction whether or not a test is indicated. And then at the same website you’ll be directed to one of these incredible companies that are going to give a little bit of their parking lot so that people can come by and do a drive by test. Mr. President, I want to join you in thanking Walmart, and CVS, and Target, and Walgreen. These are companies that are synonymous with communities, large and small, where people come together and now they’re going to come together to meet the needs of the American public. These commercial laboratories, LabCorp, and Quest, and Roche have just done an incredible job stepping forward and they’re going to literally make, literally make hundreds and thousands of tests available and being processed with results to patients in the very near future.
Mike Pence: (19:33)
But it’s all a result of you tasking us with bringing together not just government resources, which all state labs can now test across the country. CDC is testing. But you said, Mr. President, that we wanted to bring all the resources of the country together and that’s what this partnership really means. Truth is that we have coronavirus cases now in 46 American states and while the risk of serious illness of the coronavirus remains low, we want to encourage every American to practice common sense, practice good hygiene, go to the CDC’s website to see what the guidance is for your community, or for the American people broadly. And as the President has said, it’s especially important now that we look after senior citizens with chronic underlying health conditions.
Mike Pence: (20:22)
Last week the President directed the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services to raise the standards in our nursing homes, increase inspections at our nursing homes. And today, we’re offering very specific guidance, which Seema Verma will articulate about visitations at nursing homes. It’s important to remember that they were there for us when we were growing up, Mr. President. They helped us with our homework. They tucked us in at night, they cheered us on as we pursued educations, cheered us on in our careers. Now it’s time for us to be there for them and to recognize that seniors with chronic health conditions are the most vulnerable and Americans can make a difference. So wash your hands. Use common sense. Look after the most vulnerable. And Mr. President, I know I join you in saying that every American should be proud of this incredible public private partnership that’s going to be speeding access of testing to millions of Americans in the weeks ahead. And together, as you’ve said many times, together we’ll get through this, together we’ll put the health of America first.
Donald Trump: (21:26)
Thank you.
Mike Pence: (21:26)
[inaudible 00:21:28].
Donald Trump: (21:29)
Seema? Where’s Seema? I’d like you to maybe take that a step further please on nursing homes.
Seema Verma: (21:35)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (21:36)
Thanks.
Seema Verma: (21:36)
Thank you. Well, thank you to the President for the declaration. It allows my agency, CMS, that runs Medicare and Medicaid and has oversight of all of the nation’s healthcare facilities to suspend regulations that could get in the way of treating patients during this time. These temporary national blanket waivers are reserved for the rarest of circumstances and they represent a massive mobilization of our country’s resources to combat this terrible virus. And the flexibilities we are offering will be a Godsend to the providers, clinicians, and facilities on the front lines of this fight.
Seema Verma: (22:14)
And later, CMS is going to be issuing guidance, directing nursing homes to temporarily restrict all visitors and non-essential personnel with a few exceptions such as end of life situations. We fully appreciate that this measure represents a severe trial for residents of nursing homes and those who love them, but we are doing what we must to protect our vulnerable elderly. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (22:41)
Thank you very much. As I said in my address to the nation the other night, all Americans have a role to play in defeating this virus. Our most effective weapon right now is to limit the damage to our people and our country and slow the spread of the virus itself. The choice we make-
Donald Trump: (23:03)
… spread of the virus itself. The choice we make, the precautions we put into place, are critical to overcoming the virus, reducing its spread and shortening the duration of the pandemic which is what it is. The CDC has published guidelines on the coronavirus.gov to enable… It’s coronavirus.gov. It’s very heavily used right now, I will say, to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families and their communities. While the risks to young and healthy Americans remains very low, we’ve learned a lot about this over the last two weeks. Anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions. And those who are most at risk, they have not done very well. Older Americans, especially if they have a health problem, they have not done well.
Donald Trump: (24:06)
We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take, and that we see other people take. We want to prevent the spread and transmission of the disease. It’s incredible what’s happening with the sporting world, where so many of the great sports that we’ve gotten so used to at this time of the year, they’re not going to be meeting. They’ve done a great service, actually. But that would be another way that problems could be caused.
Donald Trump: (24:40)
But this is why I outlined on Wednesday night, my administration’s… The fact that we’ve issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places. But in particular, nursing homes. We should all be working off the same playbook when it comes to protecting Americans. We have to. We need to be consistent in adopting measures to limit the spread of the virus. The virus is the same whether it’s spreading in cities, towns, or rural communities. The tools and tactics for attacking it are similar, no matter where you go. No matter where you go, you have some hotspots throughout the world right now that people would have never thought possible, and they’re being very seriously affected.
Donald Trump: (25:27)
Key among these efforts, are breaking chains of transmission between people. These measures have been adopted by many companies, universities and schools. We want to protect the safety and the health of their employees and their students. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we’ve issued by CDC, and these common sense measures. A lot of it is common sense. For the areas where the virus is spreading, the CDC is advising communities to postpone large gatherings, postpone assemblies, social functions and sporting events, stagger recess and lunch for schools that aren’t canceled, limit in-person meetings, increase scheduled cleanings, and cancel work-sponsored travel, among numerous other steps that can be taken.
Donald Trump: (26:17)
Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on Earth. And in the coming weeks, we will all have to make changes and sacrifices. But these short term sacrifices will produce long term gain. Again, I’ve said we’re learning a lot for the future and future problems like this, or worse. Or worse, it could get worse. The next eight weeks are critical. We can learn, and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of the doctors say it will wash through and will flow through, in interesting terms, very accurate. I think you’re going to find in a number of weeks, it’s going to be a very accurate term.
Donald Trump: (27:02)
In times of hardship. The true character of America always shines through. We live in the company of the greatest heroes and the most inspiring citizens anywhere in the world. We want to take care of our people. We want to draw on the strength of our history, draw on the strength of our people. Then we will get through this. All together, we will just get through it. So much progress has already been made. And frankly, the numbers because the steps that have been taken, are at a level that a lot of people are surprised… especially when you compare them with other places with far smaller populations.
Donald Trump: (27:41)
The spirit and the will of our nation is unbreakable. We will defeat this threat. When America is tested, America rises to the occasion. And to those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, I want you to know that your federal government will unleash every authority, resource and tool at its disposal, to safeguard the lives and health of our people. So we’re with you every step of the way. No nation is more prepared or more equipped to face down this crisis.
Donald Trump: (28:13)
As you know, we are rated number one in the world. We’re also helping other nations. Many of the nations, we’re helping them a lot. And they are doing okay in some cases. In some cases, they are not doing well at all. But we’re working with a lot of groups of people and a lot of other nations. With faith and heart and hope and love and determination, we will succeed. We will prevail. We will be very, very successful. And we’ll learn for the future. Thank you all very much. If you have any questions, we can take some. Go ahead, John, please. And if you’d like to ask some of the folks up here, it would be fine. Please.
John: (28:53)
Mr. President, where are you with the House bill? Yesterday, we talked to you in the Oval Office. You were opposed to it. What has happened since then, and what’s the holdup on that?
Donald Trump: (29:01)
Well, we just don’t think they’re giving enough. We don’t think the Democrats are giving enough. We’re negotiating. We thought we had something. But all of a sudden, they didn’t agree to certain things that they agreed to. So we could have something, but we don’t think they’re giving enough. They’re not doing what’s right for the country.
John: (29:19)
And if I could ask Dr. Fauci.
Donald Trump: (29:21)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 1: (29:23)
Thank you, Mr. President. You just mentioned waiving interest for student loans.
Donald Trump: (29:27)
Yeah.
Speaker 1: (29:28)
You talked about buying oil from the SPR, or adding to the SPR. What other specific targeted measures is your administration thinking about taking? The Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, said today that you’re just in the second inning of things that you might be undergoing.
Donald Trump: (29:41)
Yeah. Well, that’s true. We are looking at many different things, as you know. Some of them, they’ve been written about very widely. But we’re going to be releasing a paper in about two hours stating quite a few other steps, very important ones. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 1: (29:55)
One more sir, if you wouldn’t mind.
Donald Trump: (29:56)
Please, go ahead.
Speaker 2: (29:57)
Thank you so much, Mr. President. I want to know if you are in contact with the Brazilian President, Bolsonaro, after a member of his delegation who was with you Saturday, was tested positive. And also, I want to ask another question if you’ll let me. Senators Lindsey Graham and also Senator Scott, Rick Scott, are self-isolating. Are you planning to take any kind of precautionary measure to protect you, and also your staff who was there?
Donald Trump: (30:26)
No. We have a no symptoms, whatsoever. We had a great meeting with the President of Brazil, Bolsonaro. Great guy, a very tremendous… He’s doing a fantastic job for Brazil. As you know, he tested negative. Meaning, nothing wrong this morning, and we got that word too. Because we did have dinner with him. We were sitting next to each other for a long period of time.
Speaker 2: (30:51)
But are you in contact with him over the coronavirus crisis?
Donald Trump: (30:57)
We’re talking about it, country to country. But we did discuss if he had a problem. It was reported that he may have it, and he doesn’t, fortunately. Yeah.
Speaker 3: (31:05)
Thank you so much, Mr. President. Dr. Fauci said earlier this week that the lag in testing was in fact, failing. Do you take responsibility for that? And when can you guarantee that every single American who needs a test will be able to have a test? What’s the date of that?
Donald Trump: (31:25)
Yeah. No, I don’t take responsibility at all because we were given a set of circumstances, and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time. It wasn’t meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we’re talking about. And what we’ve done is, redesigned it very quickly with the help of the people behind me. We’re now in very, very strong shape. I think we’ll be announcing, as I said, Sunday night. This will start very quickly. We’ll have the ability to do in the millions over a very, very quick period of time. So, no.
Donald Trump: (32:03)
What we have done and we are going to be leaving a very indelible print for the future in case something like this happens again. But it was a… And that’s not the fault of anybody. Frankly, the old system worked very well for smaller numbers, much smaller numbers, but not for these kinds of numbers. Tony, maybe you’d like to say something.
Speaker 3: (32:21)
By Sunday night, will have… yes, please. By Sunday night, will every American be able to get a test?
Tony Fauci: (32:25)
So just to reiterate what I said to many of you multiple times, it’s a dissent of a system. The system was not designed… For what it was designed for, it worked very well. The CDC designed a good system. If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it, or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector. And this is exactly what you’re seeing, because you can’t do it without it. So when I said that, I meant the system was not designed for what we need. Now looking forward, the system will take care of it.
Speaker 3: (33:01)
Mr. President, with respect-
Donald Trump: (33:03)
And interestingly, if you go back… Please. If you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn’t do testing like this. And actually, they lost approximately 14,000 people. And they didn’t do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late. What we’ve done and one of the reasons I think people are respecting what we’ve done, we’ve done it very early. We’ve gotten it very early, and we’ve also kept a lot of people out.
Speaker 3: (33:30)
Mr. President. Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (33:31)
Yes. Please, go ahead.
Speaker 3: (33:31)
The last administration that they had tested a million people at this point. You’ve been-
Donald Trump: (33:35)
Well, ask them how they did with the swine flu. It was a disaster.
Speaker 3: (33:38)
But with respect-
Donald Trump: (33:38)
Next, please. Next, please. They had a very big failure with swine flu, a very big failure.
Speaker 4: (33:45)
Mr. President, I want to ask you about the European travel ban that goes into effect at midnight tonight, and the exemption that you’ve offered to the U.K. There are 17 countries that are in the so-called Schengen Zone that have fewer coronavirus cases than the U.K. And just in the past 24 hours, the U.K. has added 208 coronavirus cases to their total. Why do they, Mr. President, deserve an exemption? And would you consider adding them to this travel ban list?
Donald Trump: (34:15)
Well, that was recommended to me by a group of professionals. We are looking at it based on the new numbers that are coming out, and we may have to include them in the list of countries that we will… you could say ban or whatever it is, during this period of time. But yeah, their numbers have gone up fairly precipitously over the last 24 hours, so we may be adding that. And we may be adding a couple of others. And we may frankly, start thinking about taking some off. Go ahead.
Speaker 5: (34:46)
Thank you, Mr President. I’m a correspondent with Hong Kong Phoenix TV. You have mentioned that the number in China has been decreasing, and China has made tremendous progress in the past weeks.
Donald Trump: (34:58)
True.
Speaker 5: (34:59)
I’m wondering, how much confidence does this give you to control the virus in the United States? And do you think the data China has been sharing with the United States has been helpful?
Donald Trump: (35:12)
I think it has been helpful. We have been working very much with China. I’ve spoken, as you know, with President Xi. They went through hell. Their numbers are starting to look very good. They’re really looking very good. We’re very happy about that. We are sharing data, yes. In fact, we’re sharing quite a bit of data, including the fact that some of our pharmaceutical companies are working over there right now with large groups of people. Yeah. Go ahead, please.
Ross Palombo: (35:39)
Thank you, Mr. President. You spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau yesterday.
Donald Trump: (35:43)
Yes, sir.
Ross Palombo: (35:44)
Did you discuss the potential closing of the border between Canada and the U.S.? And by extension, are you considering ways to salvage the $2 billion daily trade between the two countries?
Donald Trump: (35:57)
So we didn’t discuss the border. We’ve had a very good relationship. Just about finished with the USMCA, as you know. He called. Actually, he called me to tell me that. I think that was the primary reason for the call. At the time, his wife had not been diagnosed. She’s a lovely lady, wonderful lady, great lady. Since then, I’ve heard, read, that the result was that she has it. I was a little surprised. I think he was surprised also. We did discuss it prior, too. She’s going to be fine. But he thought that she would not most likely have the virus. Unfortunately, she does. But we didn’t discuss the border yesterday, no. Go ahead, please. If you have any questions for these great geniuses up here, you should, even a business question related to what we’re talking about.
Ross Palombo: (36:49)
Mr. President, Ross Palombo from ABC News Miami. As a relatively new Floridian, what is your message today to the cruise line industry and the travel industry, that Florida depends upon? And since Senator Rick Scott and Miami Dade Mayor Carlos A. Giménez have the same exposure as you and they are self-isolating, what’s your message to them, that they shouldn’t be?
Donald Trump: (37:11)
Well, I don’t know that I had exposure, but I don’t have any of the symptoms. We do have a White House doctor. I should say, many White House doctors, frankly. I asked them that same question, and they said, “You don’t have any symptoms whatsoever.” We don’t want people without symptoms to go and do the test. The test is not insignificant. As far as the cruise line business, we’re with them all the way. It’s a great business. It’s a great U.S. business, frankly. I know how important they are to the country. That includes airlines. But the cruise line business obviously, was hit very hard.
Donald Trump: (37:48)
We had a tremendous success out in Oakland, where moved… Vice President Pence did a fantastic job with that. We worked with U.K., we worked with Canada. They took their people back in. Canada’s approximately 600 people. U.K. likewise, took a large number of people back to the United Kingdom. We have people quarantined. It was a big operation, and it worked out really… You don’t hear about it anymore. It worked out really well. Mike, you may even want to say something about that, because that was really done properly.
Mike Pence: (38:20)
Well, thank you, Mr. President. That program with the Grand Princess, the ship, is continuing to be administered in the highest standards. Orderly way, as the President directed. Americans that needed treatment have received them. I spoke to the Governor of Iowa today, and some of those who now have been cleared are able in proper supervision, to be returning to Iowa. They’re making arrangements for them to do that. Others in Texas, others in Georgia. Again, it’s another example of the extraordinary cooperation. Governor Abbott, Governor Gavin Newsom, Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia.
Mike Pence: (38:59)
But to add to that, the President directed me last Saturday to travel down to Miami. We met with all the leaders of the cruise line industry. Several cruise lines have announced a 60-day pause in operations. Our Department of Homeland Security has praised them for doing that, because of the unique health challenges particularly presented to seniors with underlying conditions. We have a proposal from the cruise line industry, but they’re currently considering what other steps that they might take. Perhaps even similar to what those other lines have taken. We’re anticipating some response on that in the next 24 hours.
Mike Pence: (39:44)
But as the President said, the American people cherish our cruise line industry. The men and women who work on the ships, the men and women who work on the shore. All the economies that are so benefited by a vibrant cruise line industry. And what the President has directed us to do is… whether there is a pause in the moment as some cruise lines are doing. And as we all continue to discuss, we want to work with the cruise line industry to ensure that when we come through this, the cruise lines and the medical services that are available and for the passengers and all of the crew, that cruise lines are safer than ever before, and can prosper for many years to come.
Donald Trump: (40:22)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 6: (40:29)
This question is for Drs. Fauci and Berks. Dr. Fauci, based on what you currently know, what is the trajectory for when this outbreak will peak? How long will the American people have to remain on this emergency footing? And for Dr. Berks, as the administration tries to get its arms around this test kit shortage issue, the next glaring need could respirators and related hospital equipment. So what is the administration doing right now to ramp up production of respirators and that kind of equipment, should this outbreak persist?
Tony Fauci: (41:00)
When you have an outbreak like this, particularly if you’re trying to interfere with it, it’s really impossible to predict the time element of when it’s going to peak and when it’s naturally going to go down. So if you look at the situation where countries really did not get to the point of trying to contain and mitigate very well, you see a peak over several weeks, and then down again over other several weeks. What we’re trying to do with the efforts that we’re doing, is to blunt that peak. And I mentioned it many times. And I think it’s important and appropriate for me to mention it again, because it answers your question.
Tony Fauci: (41:35)
When you talk about preventing infections from without in, which is the kind of travel restrictions we’re talking about, then how do you handle what you already have in your country? You continue some sort of containment, but you also do mitigation. And you try to proportionate to the areas where there are the most infections. The success of that and how much you make this turn into this, is going to give you the amount of time. If we’re successful, it’ll be less. If we’re not successful, it’s going to be more. But these kind of things generally run out in a few months. Hopefully, we’ll make it several weeks. Eight, nine, whatever weeks. But I can’t give you a number, because it depends on how successful we are.
Deborah Birx: (42:21)
Great. Thank you. It’s a great question. Dr. Fauci and I have worked together a very long time, and continue. It’s a privilege to work with him every day. I think you can learn very… I appreciate there was some graphics done by some of the reporting over the last several days. If you align the data from China with the data with South Korea, you can start to see almost a complete overlay of that data. So that’s what we’re tracking very closely, as well as Italy.
Deborah Birx: (42:47)
But you have an excellent question. I just want to make one note. In South Korea, I want to repeat, only 4% of the tests were positive. That means 96% of the people had a different respiratory disease. Because we’re in the middle of flu season, cold season, and all of the other respiratory diseases that we get every day. In LabCorp and Quest’s early data, they’re running about 1% to 2% positive. That means that we have a lot more other respiratory disease out there besides the coronavirus, and that’s why the screening is critical. But even with the screening, we’re going to run what we think are very low rates.
Deborah Birx: (43:25)
Needless to say though, we’re taking it extraordinarily seriously to plan for what could come. What Dr. Fauci talked about, blunting the curve, that makes it much less high need at that peak of the curve that we’re all planning for. So we’re in full inventory of all of our assets by the President, on lacking and this emergency order and the Secretary of HHS’s ability. It unlocks all of those stockpiles, those needs. What the VA has, what the DOD has, what the National Guard has, and what every hospital has. The hospital emergency preparedness plan allows them to defer elective issues to keep those hospital beds open for those who might need it. So we’re in full planning mode for each of those things.
Donald Trump: (44:10)
I might add that we are in the process and in some cases have already done it, ordered a large number of respirators just in case. We hope we don’t need them, but we’ve ordered a large number. Yeah. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 7: (44:25)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. In your speech to the nation, you mentioned the situation in China and South Korea have improved. And you are thinking about remove the restrictions, also the warning in place right now. When can we expect that announcement, and how do you see the overall progress that Asian countries made?
Donald Trump: (44:47)
Well, some were making progress. Some are not, as you know. But some are making progress. And as they make progress, as they get down to the number that we all think is right, that they know is right, we know is right, we’ll be opening it up. Some are really moving along rapidly. We hope to be able to open things up as quickly as possible. Go ahead, please. Go ahead.
Speaker 8: (45:07)
Mr. President, I’d like to ask Secretary Azar and Dr. Fauci, just how… Dr. Fauci, okay.
Donald Trump: (45:22)
Right, better. Better. Not 100%, but 90%.
Speaker 8: (45:25)
Right.
Donald Trump: (45:25)
Go ahead.
Speaker 8: (45:26)
This affects the elderly, primarily. In that sense, it’s an unusual disease. Is any specific research being done as to why it affects our senior citizens more than others?
Tony Fauci: (45:42)
I don’t mean to diminish your question, but we already know why it would affect senior citizens more. Because when you talk about anything that requires a robust immune system, as you get older, your immune system is not as potent as it is when you were young. And that’s the reason why when you talk about-
Tony Fauci: (46:03)
When you were young, and that’s the reason why when you talk about even influenza, which we have extraordinary experience with over decades and decades, the people who are very vulnerable are the elderly and those with underlying conditions. The same thing holds true for a variety of other disease. Why cancer is more prevalent in some, in mostly in older individuals. Of course, the immune system that screens for it is less robust, so it really is something that is kind of well known over a lot of studies.
Donald Trump: (46:34)
Okay. OAN please. OAN.
OAN: (46:40)
Mr. President, the Chinese officials are expressing some tones of discontent with where the source of this virus has come from, and they’re spinning some odd narratives. What are your response to the Chinese officials who are doing that, and have they signaled any kind of resistance to upcoming trade talks in response to how we’re handling this virus?
Donald Trump: (47:10)
No. We have our deal with China. They’re going to be buying $250 billion worth of goods and 50 billion from our farmers, and it’s a great deal for our country. It’s about time somebody did that and, frankly, phase two, we’ll start negotiating. I did read one article, but I don’t think that article was representative, certainly not in my conversations with President Xi, and they know where it came from. We all know where it came from.
Yamiche A.: (47:41)
Thank you, Mr. President. Yamiche Alcindor from PBS News Hour.
Donald Trump: (47:44)
Yes.
Yamiche A.: (47:44)
My first question is, you said that you don’t take responsibility, but you did disband the White House pandemic office and the officials that were working in that office left this administration abruptly, so what responsibility do you take to that? The officials that worked in that office said that the White House lost valuable time because that office wasn’t disbanded. What do you make of that?
Donald Trump: (48:04)
I just think it’s a nasty question, because what we’ve done is … and Tony had said numerous times that we’ve saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing. When you say ‘me’, I didn’t do it. We have a group of people I could ask, perhaps in my administration, but I could perhaps ask Tony about that, because I don’t know anything about it. You say we did that. I don’t know anything about it.
Yamiche A.: (48:29)
You don’t know about the reorganization that happened at the National Security Council?
Donald Trump: (48:32)
[crosstalk 00:48:30]. It’s the administration. Perhaps they do that. People let people go. You used to be with a different newspaper than you are now. Things like that happen.
Yamiche A.: (48:38)
But this wasn’t-
Donald Trump: (48:39)
Okay, please go ahead.
Donald Trump: (48:41)
We’re doing a great job. Let me tell you, these professionals behind me and these great, incredible doctors and business people, the best in the world. I can say that whether it’s retailers or labs or anything you want to say, these are the best in the world. We’re doing a great job. We have 40 people right now. 40. Compare that with other countries that have many, many times that amount. One of the reasons we have 40 and others have … and again, that number’s going up, just so you understand, and a number of cases which are very small, relatively speaking, it’s going up, but we’ve done a great job because we acted quickly, we acted early, and there’s nothing we could have done that was better than closing our borders to highly infected areas.
Donald Trump: (49:21)
Please, go ahead.
Vanessa: (49:22)
Thank you, Mr. President. Vanessa [inaudible 00:49:24] for NTN24 for all Latin American countries and also for Spain, [foreign language 00:49:29]. I would like to ask you two very brief questions. One, for how long we’re going to have the national emergency?
Donald Trump: (49:39)
I hope not long, but it’s there now and it gives tremendous powers for things that we need. Tremendous power actually, and the Stafford Act and various other things that we’re involved with and have studied and memorized in so many different ways and forms. It gives the kind of power that we need to get rid of this virus, and we’re going to do it very quickly, and I hope we won’t need it very long, but whatever it takes.
Vanessa: (50:04)
For now, we still don’t know for how long? I have something very important I wanted to ask you is, do you really think it’s essential coordinating with other countries and learning from the lessons that they already suffered the same situation? Countries, of course, like China and South Korea, but now recently Italy and Spain, and how is that coordination done? Thank you so much, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (50:26)
We’re in touch with Italy, and it’s a country that we love. We have millions and millions of people originally from Italy, and we’re working with them. They’re in, probably relatively speaking, the toughest position of all. We’re in touch with everybody. When I say everybody, we’re in touch with many of the countries that you know about that you’re writing about, and they’re calling us asking for advice. They’re asking for the advice of the people behind me. Italy’s got a tough situation, but they have really clamped down, and I think they’re going to see some very good results. It’s tough what they did. They really took their medicine, but they’re going to see some much better results.
Donald Trump: (51:14)
Yeah, Jeff.
Jeff: (51:17)
Thank you, sir. With regard to domestic travel, should Americans feel safe, or should Americans at all be traveling to states such as Washington state, New York, and other hotspots within this country? And a followup on Brazil. You’re asking people who come back from Europe, Americans who are coming back from Europe, to self-quarantine for a couple weeks. You were in a picture with somebody who now has Coronavirus from Brazil at Mar-a-Lago. How is that different?
Donald Trump: (51:46)
Well, I’ll tell you. First of all, I’m not coming back from someplace.
Jeff: (51:49)
But you were exposed.
Donald Trump: (51:50)
There was somebody that they say has it. I have no idea who he is, but I take pictures and it lasts for literally seconds. I don’t know the gentleman that we’re talking about. I have no idea who he is. I haven’t seen the picture. It’s said there’s a picture of somebody, but I take sometimes hundreds of pictures a day, and that night I was taking hundreds of pictures, so I just don’t know. Now, I did sit with the President for probably two hours, but he’s tested negative, so that’s good.
Jeff: (52:15)
It’s just a matter of-
Donald Trump: (52:16)
Please, go. Go ahead, please.
Donald Trump: (52:21)
I would say if you stay home, it’s not bad. It’s not bad. Now, there are certain parts of the country that essentially have zero problem. Washington’s been very tough, in particular, nursing home, but the state of Washington’s been very tough. When you talk about the 40 deaths, that’s been a big percentage of the deaths, as you know very well, and they all came from a certain area, unfortunately.
Donald Trump: (52:50)
Please, go ahead. Go ahead. Okay.
Cordelia L.: (52:55)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. Cordelia Lynch, Sky News. You talk this week about the UK doing a good job in tackling Coronavirus. In light of the rise in cases, are you changing your mind about that? You also just spoke about possible travel restrictions. Have you discussed when they might be put in place?
Donald Trump: (53:14)
As we discussed before, in light of the results, we’re going to be looking at it and I know the task force is looking at it very strongly. Vice President, everybody. It was looking good, but the results have been building up pretty rapidly, so we’ll be taking another look at that. Yes, absolutely.
Donald Trump: (53:33)
Go ahead, please.
Speaker 9: (53:36)
Mr. President, thank you. I want to first follow up on Jeff’s question, because the person you were standing next to, whether you know who he is or not, tested positive for Coronavirus. Dr. Fauci said this morning, if you stand next to somebody who tested positive, you should self-isolate and get a test. You say your White House doctor is telling you something different. Who should Americans listen to? My second question is-
Donald Trump: (54:01)
I think they have to listen to their doctors, and I think they shouldn’t be jumping to get the tests unless it’s necessary, but I think they have to listen to their doctors. I haven’t seen the picture. Somebody said there’s a picture of somebody taking a picture with me, but I haven’t seen it, but I can tell you-
Speaker 9: (54:15)
Doctors have said you might have it even if you don’t have symptoms. Are you being selfish by not getting tested and potentially exposing-
Donald Trump: (54:21)
I didn’t say I wasn’t going to be tested.
Speaker 9: (54:23)
Are you going to be?
Donald Trump: (54:24)
Most likely, yeah. Most likely.
Speaker 9: (54:26)
When do think that’ll happen?
Donald Trump: (54:26)
Not for that reason, but because I think I will do it anyway.
Speaker 9: (54:30)
Will you let us know the results?
Donald Trump: (54:30)
Fairly soon. We’re working on that. We’re working out a schedule.
Speaker 9: (54:33)
My second question, Mr. President. That was a follow-up.
Donald Trump: (54:35)
You, go ahead please. Go ahead. Yeah.
Speaker 10: (54:42)
I know there’s been a lot of talk about testing. I just want to make sure we’re clear though, because we’ve been hearing from doctors who say, as of today, they still can’t get patients tested who need a test. As of today, can everyone who a doctor wants to have tested get tested? If not, when? When will doctors-
Donald Trump: (55:01)
That’s been true for a while, but I’ll let Mike … Why don’t you answer that, Mike?
Mike Pence: (55:08)
As the President said, and Dr. Fauci has articulated, the nature of our current system where the CDC has samples sent and tests are performed or state labs perform tests, or in some cases, university and hospital labs perform tests, is generally adequate for an infectious disease or for people getting diagnostic work done, but given the sheer scale of this, the President tasked us with bringing together this extraordinary public and private partnership. Today, by some estimates, when you add all the labs together, and today the President made it possible for every state in the country and their state labs to authorize labs across their state to do Coronavirus testing.
Mike Pence: (55:56)
We’re estimating somewhere between 15 and 20,000 tests a day are able to be performed, but very soon with the program that was announced today, Americans will be able to visit one of the sites closest to them, as described on the website, if they’re symptomatic, if the questionnaire indicates it, be able to have a test there, and these incredible companies will process the test and they’ll receive that information. For now, the best advice that we can give for people is to speak to their doctor, as the President just said. If the doctor indicates, that physician, if it’s not a university hospital or an otherwise authorized lab, can contact the state lab.
Mike Pence: (56:44)
Again, every state lab in the country can perform tests today, but what the President charged us with when I was tasked to take over the White House Coronavirus task force was open up tests all across the country. The President said a few days ago that we made it clear that any American that wanted to get a test would be able clinically to get a test. I literally heard from the Governor of Washington state who said the doctors in Washington state were saying that if you were only mildly symptomatic, they would not order a test. Fortunately, the President directed CDC to clarify that. Now anyone in consultation with their physician, regardless of their symptoms, can request a test, and their doctors will contact those agencies, those labs in their state, but very soon, Americans will be able to go to these drive-in sites and be able to obtain and participate in a test.
Mike Pence: (57:40)
Dr. Burks, is there more to amplify that?
Deborah Birx: (57:42)
No, I think that’s perfectly said. Just to review one more time about the testing, with Lab Corp and Quest, I think many of you have been to doctor’s office and seen the little boxes outside. What they do is they deliver both the specimen collection piece, because remember it’s a nasal swab, it’s not a tube of blood, so they’ve delivered that to doctor’s offices and hospitals, and then they will arrange to pick that up. The important piece in this all is they’ve gone from a machine that may have a lower throughput to the potential to have automated extraction. I know you don’t want all these details, but it’s really key for the laboratory people. It’s an automated extraction of the RNA that then runs in an automated way on the machine with no one touching it, and the result comes out at the other end. Sample to machine to results. That cuts out a lot of the manual pieces that were happening that were delaying the test results.
Speaker 10: (58:41)
So with that, what’s the timeline like from when you’re tested to when you get results? Like next week, what should people expect?
Deborah Birx: (58:47)
With the prior testing, it was taking several days because the test is slower. We believe with this test, because of its throughput, that the testing can be from start, remember it has to transport, to the laboratory that will run it, and then we’re hoping that all can be finished within 24 hours, which is very similar to other tests that you receive today. These are not point-of-care tests. We are working on point-of-care tests, but we have to realize point-of-care tests take six months or more to develop, so we’re not waiting for those. We’re still diagnosing this on nucleic acid, so it is an antibody. This is actually the antigen, the actual virus in your nose that we’re amplifying.
Donald Trump: (59:34)
I think you have to remember though, we’re working very closely with states and to those you have a smaller form and more targeted form of government going in and doing it, like in New York where the relationship is very good. Like Gavin Newsom, where he made some very complimentary … that’s California. He made some really complementary comments the other day about how we’re working together. We worked on the ship together, but we worked on a lot of other things together having to do with this, and really, the relationship that we have, I can’t think of a bad relationship. We’re helping them, we’re funding them, in some cases, depending on what it is you’re talking about, and we’re all working together very closely. So we’ve done really, I think, a tremendous job of teamwork with the different states.
Donald Trump: (01:00:22)
All right, one or two more, and if you have questions for these folks … Does anybody have a question for the folks up here? Who has a question up here? You have? Okay, go ahead. If you have a question, go ahead.
Speaker 11: (01:00:35)
Thank you. I have one for you as well.
Donald Trump: (01:00:36)
I thought. I knew you would.
Speaker 11: (01:00:37)
I do have one for them because I haven’t heard this yet.
Donald Trump: (01:00:42)
I was waiting for that. Go ahead.
Speaker 11: (01:00:42)
Because I haven’t heard this yet.
Donald Trump: (01:00:42)
Ask them first please.
Speaker 11: (01:00:43)
Yes, I will. Okay, with regards to the CEOs, can you please tell us when you expect to see items like hand sanitizer, that have been going out of stock very quickly, back on the shelves? There have been a lot of reports about that, and for you, Mr. President, could you talk about a potential bailout for the cruise industry? You had suggested that could happen. Is that something you’re still looking at, and how much would that be?
Donald Trump: (01:01:07)
Well, I didn’t suggest that it could happen, but I could tell you it’s an industry that was very badly impacted by what’s going on with the virus. It’s a great industry, it’s a very important industry, and we will be helping them and we will be helping the airline industry if we have to, assuming we have to. So far people haven’t been asking, but if they should be asking, we want to make sure our airlines are very strong, and then in one day all of a sudden wasn’t looking so good. Interestingly, I was talking to Doug, and the numbers they’re doing from the retailing standpoint I guess because of this, your business is like the opposite. All of you have been selling a lot of stuff. Do you want to answer the question as to the hand sanitizers?
Doug: (01:01:51)
Sure. Specifically the areas where we’re seeing pressure in the supply chain are surface cleaners, cleaning supplies, paper goods in particular. Hand sanitizer is going to be very difficult to have 100% in stock on for some time. We’re still replenishing it and shipping it, but as soon as it hits the stores it’s going. The same thing’s true for the categories I just mentioned, so all the retailers will be working hand-in-hand with the suppliers to bring that to the market as fast as we can.
Speaker 11: (01:02:13)
What is your advice though for Americans who are seeking those items? What is your advice? They’re selling out online, they’re selling out in the stores.
Doug: (01:02:20)
I think this team has given you other examples of what people can do to fight back against this virus, and you should look at the entire list.
Speaker 12: (01:02:29)
Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci.
Donald Trump: (01:02:31)
Please.
Tony Fauci: (01:02:34)
Obviously it sounds very simplistic, but wash your hands as often as you possibly can. I know you’re not always in a position to be able to wash your hands, but wash them just as much as you can. If you don’t have the alcohol wipes, try and get them. If you can’t get them, just try as best as possible to do it. You got to do the best you can.
Speaker 13: (01:02:55)
Just general preparedness. You want to wash your hands, you want to keep distance from people, and if you’re around someone sick, keep away from them. This is basic, basic public health. Now these guys are selling a lot of toilet paper. Tony, do you need to give some guidance that toilet paper is not an effective protection against getting the Coronavirus. They’re selling out, but the soap and water, hot water, soap, 20 seconds. That’s how you do it.
Donald Trump: (01:03:23)
Okay, one more. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, over you. Behind you. Behind you.
Speaker 14: (01:03:28)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. You have a great team, of course.
Donald Trump: (01:03:31)
That’s true. Thank you.
Speaker 14: (01:03:32)
My question, Mr. President, are you happy from the Chinese response? What correctly really told you what really happened those days? Second, Prime Minister Modi of India have closed borders until April 15th, if you have spoken with the prime minister of India, and if they have needed any help? Finally, sir, any method for the small businesses, because they are losing some business because of this. Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (01:03:58)
On small businesses, the Small Business Administration is now stacked with money to help them, and we’re going to make the money readily available if they need it, small businesses. We had a great time in India. It was an incredible two days, and he’s a great friend of mine and he’s a friend of his people, because he was greeted incredibly warmly, as was I in that stadium. It was an incredible event, and I loved being with him, so just to say “hello” to him.
Donald Trump: (01:04:28)
We talked about everything. We’ve talked about far more than just borders, and as far as President, he, likewise, he’s a friend of mine. I believe that we are dealing in good faith, that we just worked, as you know and as I just said. We just worked an incredible deal, big deal, one of the biggest deals ever made of any kind. Big, even by the standards of some of the people here, the deal with China, but I think that they want to get to the bottom of things also.
Donald Trump: (01:04:55)
We’re working, our drug companies, our pharmaceutical companies, are working very closely with China and with India, as you know, and with all over the world, and they’re all over the world. These are magnificent companies that are very, very knowledgeable and we’re very lucky to have them, because I think you’re going to come up with, whether it’s therapeutic or whether it’s just help. Helping getting better, and then ultimately a vaccine, which takes a little bit longer because of the test periods and couple of other reasons. You’re going to have it very quickly because of the great knowledge. They’ll have it very quickly. They’ve made a tremendous amount of progress.
Donald Trump: (01:05:30)
Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Mar 11, 2020",1:23 P.M. IST,"President Trump: (00:00)
My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about our nation’s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world. Today, the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic. We have been in frequent contact with our allies, and we are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people. This is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will significantly reduce the threat to our citizens, and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus. From the beginning of time, nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges including large scale and very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be.
President Trump: (01:05)
It only matters how you respond and we are responding with great speed and professionalism. Our team is the best anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak, we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on China, and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We declared a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus spread its horrible infection. And taking early intense action, we have seen dramatically fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. The European union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seated by travelers from Europe. After consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans.
President Trump: (02:15)
To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight. These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground. There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom. At the same time, we are monitoring the situation in China and South Korea, and as their situation improves, we will reevaluate the restrictions and warnings that are currently in place for a possible early opening.
President Trump: (03:13)
Earlier this week, I met with the leaders of health insurance industry who have agreed to waive all copayments for coronavirus treatments, extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing. We are cutting massive amounts of red tape to make antiviral therapies available in record time. These treatments will significantly reduce the impact and reach of the virus.
President Trump: (03:43)
Additionally, last week I signed into law an $8.3 billion funding bill to help CDC and other government agencies fight the virus and support vaccines, treatments and distribution of medical supplies. Testing and testing capabilities are expanding rapidly day by day. We are moving very quickly. The vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful. In particular, we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits. In general, older Americans should also avoid non-essential travel in crowded areas. My administration is coordinating directly with communities with largest outbreaks, and we have issued guidance on school closures, social distancing, and reducing large gatherings.
President Trump: (04:55)
Smart action today will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow. Every community faces different risks, and it is critical for you to follow the guidelines of your local officials who are working closely with our federal health experts and they are the best. For all Americans, it is essential that everyone take extra precautions and practice good hygiene. Each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus. Wash your hands, clean often used surfaces, cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough, and most of all, if you are sick or not feeling well, stay home. To ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship, I will soon be taken emergency action, which is unprecedented, to provide financial relief. This will be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus. I will be asking Congress to take legislative action to extend this relief.
President Trump: (06:04)
Because of the economic policies that we have put into place, over the last three years we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world by far. Our banks and financial institutions are fully capitalized and incredibly strong. Our unemployment is at a historic low. This vast economic prosperity gives us flexibility, reserves, and resources to handle any threat that comes our way. This is not a financial crisis. This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.
President Trump: (06:43)
However, to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, tonight I am announcing the following additional actions: I am instructing the Small Business Administration to exercise available authority to provide capital and liquidity to firms affected by the coronavirus. Effective immediately, the SBA will begin providing economic loans in effected states and territories. These low interest loans will help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions caused by the virus. To this end, I am asking Congress to increase funding for this program by an additional $50 billion. Using emergency authority, I will be instructing the Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain individuals and businesses negatively impacted. This action will provide more than $200 billion of additional liquidity to the economy.
President Trump: (07:46)
Finally, I am calling on Congress to provide Americans with immediate payroll tax relief. Hopefully they will consider this very strongly. We are at a critical time in the fight against the virus. We made a life saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe. We will not delay. I will never hesitate to take any necessary steps to protect the lives, health and safety of the American people. I will always put the well-being of America first.
President Trump: (08:21)
If we are vigilant and we can reduce the chance of infection, which we will, we will significantly impede the transmission of the virus. The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States. We have the best economy, the most advanced healthcare, and the most talented doctors, scientists, and researchers anywhere in the world. We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship, and unify together as one nation and one family. As history has proven time and time again, Americans always rise to the challenge and overcome adversity. Our future remains brighter than anyone can imagine. Acting with compassion and love, we will heal the sick, care for those in need, help our fellow citizens, and emerge from this challenge stronger and more unified than ever before. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you."
"Mar 11, 2020",1:55 P.M. IST,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Well, thank you very much. And, we are having a meeting, a very important meeting with the, I would say, the greatest bankers in the world, the most important banks in the world, financial centers. And, having a good discussion. We’re discussing the economy. We’re discussing how it relates to jobs and all of the things that are happening right now with the virus that we’ve become so familiar with. I’ll be making some decisions. I’ve already made some decisions, actually, today. But, I’ll be making some, some other ones that are very important.
Donald Trump: (00:36)
And, I thought I’d let the press into here some of the wisdom from the folks in the room and maybe Brian, I’ll start with you. And, Brian’s the chairman and you said the man at Bank of America. Highly respected. Everybody in this room is at the highest level, highly respected.
Donald Trump: (00:54)
Brian, please.
Brian Moynihan: (00:55)
Thank you, Mr. president. Thank you for bring us together. If the C-E-Os of the large banks here want you to know that we’re, because of all the work done on the capital liquidity and all of the things as we look forward to uncertainty due to the virus and the oil price changes, we’re very strong capitalized. We are in great position, in terms of liquidity, capital and strength. But, most importantly, we’re doing what we do best, which is helping our teammates, importantly, but, also, our clients and our small business customers and medium sized business customers to continue to have access to credit.
Brian Moynihan: (01:29)
All of us are providing relief to any customer that has an issue of being out of work for the virus. The things we’ve done in every natural disaster that’s occurred in many years. And, we can tell you that, up until last couple of weeks, the activity been very strong and it’s still strong.
Brian Moynihan: (01:46)
We’re still seeing people spend money. We’re still seeing people go out. Small business loans are continuing to grow. Auto loans are growing. Mortgage loans are, obviously, very strong. But, the real key is we’re well capitalized. We’re here to help small businesses, medium sized businesses, the core American economy run. And, to help our consumer clients really weather the storm in case they’re directly impacted by it.
Donald Trump: (02:06)
Thank you, Brian, very much.
Michael Corbat: (02:08)
I think a part of that, Mr. President. I think it’s important to recognize a few things. There’s one is building off what Brian said, this is not a financial crisis. And, the banks and the financial system are in sound shape and we are here to help. Part of it. I think, second is, when we look at what’s going on, in many ways we’re going at several challenges at the same time. We woke up or we went through Sunday in a precipitous drop in oil prices and we needed to deal with that when the market opened on Monday.
Michael Corbat: (02:41)
Clearly, corona is part of mind for everybody, not just here in the U-S. And, I think the market’s going through a period of trying to get price discovery. And, I think, also, trying to figure out what is the intermediate and longer term health of the economy. And, I think what we saw, we saw some fears on the back of those. And, some talk about potential recession on the back of those. And, I think the market’s going through a discovery phase and really trying to figure out what earnings are going to look like and where valuation should be.
Michael Corbat: (03:13)
I think the good news is that the market check performed in the quarterly way. The infrastructure that supports the markets, I think, has held up through some pretty good tests. We’ve had some strains along the way, but, I think it’s held up well and it’s been orderly.
Michael Corbat: (03:29)
And, as Brian said, from the banking perspective, we’re here to help. We want to provide liquidity, we want to lend to our small businesses, we want to be supporting our consumer clients.
Donald Trump: (03:38)
Well, thank you very much, Michael. That’s good. And, I think prior to the coronavirus it was just all go. The numbers were fantastic. And, we don’t even know what the numbers are now. We’ll have to see. The numbers from a week ago were great. And, from two days ago were great. But, now, we’re hitting a patch and we’re going to have to do something with respect to getting rid of this virus as quickly as possible and as safely as possible.
Donald Trump: (04:07)
Our number one priority is the health of the people of our country. And, so, we’ll be making, most likely, a statement… I’ll be making a statement later on tonight as to what I’ve decided to do and what our country will be doing.
Donald Trump: (04:22)
Charlie, please.
Charles Scharf: (04:23)
President, the only thing I would add to what Brian and Mike have said is, first of all, I’d reiterate that we are all here to help. I think what our institutions do, we’re all in the positions to do it. And, I think we’re being very, very thoughtful about how we can do that for both consumers, small businesses, as well as the companies that we deal with.
Charles Scharf: (04:43)
I think we’re all encouraging any of our customers or clients who are having any issues to make sure that they talk to us. We’re all developing programs to ensure that as they and the employees and their customers go through the situation, that we’re there to be a source of strength. Whether it’s to help them through issues with their fees, payments. Or, to be there to lend. That’s what we do.
Donald Trump: (05:05)
That’s great. I’m glad you saying that. That’s great. Because, maybe some of that, frankly, more so than you’ve been used to for the last three years. Right?
Donald Trump: (05:13)
It could happen. David.
David: (05:16)
I appreciate it, Mr. president. I’m glad to be here with my colleagues and these other institutions. Most of what I’d say would echo what’s been said. The banking system is in good shape. The virus, obviously, poses unique challenges for policymakers and for businesses large and small operating across the country. All businesses are very, very focused on their people. Taking care of their people. As part of the banking system, we’re looking to help businesses, large, small. Individuals any way we can. Making the same steps, and taking the same steps that these other institutions have spoken about it.
David: (05:49)
So, we’ll get through this, but, it’s going to require some navigation on the of all of us.
Donald Trump: (05:54)
That’s right.
David: (05:54)
And, we’re focused on doing our part.
Donald Trump: (05:54)
You’ll do it very well. And, we’ll be doing a lot of additional work with small business, as you know. We’re going to be betting many billions of dollars and we’re going to be making lots of small business loans. The banks are, too. So, we’ll be, do you have anything to say, doctor?
Speaker 6: (06:15)
Yes, of course. But, first I’d like to thank you for being so aggressive and very specific about protecting health and safety of employees. I’m very encouraged by the leaders in this industry that are thinking along the same lines about their employees. And, their community.
Speaker 6: (06:31)
I’d like to point out that S-B-A has the authority, currently, with $18 billion to provide loans with the support of all the members in this room. And, they also have the opportunity to extend some of the payment terms up to six months.
Donald Trump: (06:49)
Right.
Speaker 6: (06:49)
I’m looking forward to working with every one of them to leave no money on the table with those $18 billion dollars to provide support to small businesses.
Donald Trump: (06:58)
Yesterday’s, as you know, we met with the insurance companies, the top companies, the top people in the top companies, like yourselves. And, they were very generous. You know what they did with copays and everything else. They’re going all out. So, we appreciated that very much. Steve. Anything to say? Steve. Sorry, Steve.
Steve: (07:24)
I think the financial system in the U-S is in great shape. And, is prepared to handle this problem. One of the issues is that when people are tested more and more, there will be a better handle on what we’re dealing with. Just because there will be some economic effect, obviously. As this goes on. And we all hope it’s short. But, it’s going to need the support of the banking community. It’s going to need the support of the ability to be tested. And, if we can do that, this has a natural ending, which, most people lose sight of. And, there will be vaccines developed that will take your order, but, there may be other things meanwhile and requires immobilization of our society to deal with them.
Donald Trump: (08:24)
Yeah. They’ve made very good progress, the C-D-C and different places that are dealing with the problem. They’ve made really tremendous, tremendous strides. We’ll be announcing that, also. Thank you. Anybody else have anything to say? Ken? Anybody? Anybody?
Speaker 8: (08:41)
Mr. president, I think you’ve done a fantastic job of putting the interests of our country first with your fast action on China and travel to and from China.
Donald Trump: (08:48)
Thank you.
Speaker 8: (08:49)
I think you’re focused on fiscal stimulus is really important.
Donald Trump: (08:52)
Right.
Speaker 8: (08:53)
How do we help American that live, too often, paycheck to paycheck, get through this difficult time where they may lose their job or otherwise face more difficult circumstances. So, I think your leadership on fiscal stimulus is really thoughtful and appreciated. And, then, all of us in this room know that the financial markets are working to help America.
Speaker 8: (09:12)
The interest rates changes that we’ve seen both in the fed and in the bond markets create an odd precedent opportunity for Americans to refinance their mortgages-
Donald Trump: (09:21)
That’s true.
Speaker 8: (09:22)
… at a dramatically lower rate. Which is really good for American households. Or, to have the opportunity to buy their first house. Or, a new house for their growing families.
Speaker 8: (09:30)
So, the markets have worked as we would hope at this moment of time to help provide stimulus to the entire economy through me for lower interest rates.
Donald Trump: (09:40)
Great job you’ve done, too. Please. And, how is Jamie doing?
Speaker 9: (09:45)
Jamie’s doing well.
Donald Trump: (09:46)
All right, say hello to him. All right?
Speaker 9: (09:48)
I will. I will. For sure.
Donald Trump: (09:49)
I hear he’s doing fine.
Speaker 9: (09:49)
He’s making great progress. So, thank you. Thank you very much for asking. So, the bank has very rigorous resiliency plans both in United States and around the world. All of those are on the way right now. All of our plans are designed, obviously, to protect and help our people. And, to protect consumers and small businesses. We’ll be there with forbearance plans. We’ll be there to waive fees for consumers and small businesses who are under stress. And, I think, a very fair question is are we still lending? And, over the course of the last 40 days at J-P Morgan, we’ve extended $26 billion worth of loans to both consumers and small businesses.
Donald Trump: (10:28)
That’s great.
Speaker 9: (10:29)
And, that’s, as I said, the last 40 days. We looked a little bit at Seattle, which you know, has been, you know, a center of the virus. And, economic growth is still continuing. So, we see it’s slowed down significantly, but, people are still going to restaurants, for example. We still see that. People are buying food to be delivered by the new [inaudible 00:10:55] services. And, interestingly, in the data we also see the pull back is much more about, from the older generation, my age, than it is from the millennial generation.
Speaker 9: (11:08)
So, millennial generation spend seems to be holding up very well.
Donald Trump: (11:12)
I think there’ll be a pent up demand when this is gone. I think that everything that, maybe, where it’s stamped down now, people are leaving their homes. I think you’re going to see a tremendous pent up demand. Which, hopefully, won’t be in the too distant future. Please.
Richard: (11:26)
Mr. president, we’re not waiting for the customer or small business to call the banks. We are proactively reaching out to the customer and small businesses, waiving fees, making sure we can refinance a loan when possible. We’re up 79% versus last year in refi. Still going to take a little while to find out how much the effect really is.
Donald Trump: (11:42)
Great, Richard. Thank you. Thank you, very much. Anybody else? Anybody? Please.
Rebecca: (11:47)
Mr. president, I just add, as I represent the community banks across this country, rural markets, urban markets, suburban markets. They’re there, they’re standing ready, strong to support their communities. Whether it be your very smallest businesses, the ag communities, the community banks are here to support them. Here to help.
Donald Trump: (12:05)
Thank you.
Speaker 12: (12:07)
I would echo all the sentiments that you just heard, Mr. President. And, thank you for convening the group. I would also add that, and, echoing on something Rebecca said, we’re also helping not just all the large globally active banks, but, the 5,100 banks across the United States build continuity and resiliency programs so we can keep the banking system open to support our customers and clients who are, in many cases, are facing a time of need.
Speaker 12: (12:29)
That’s what banks do, is stick by their customers in good times and the challenging times. And, that’s what all the banks in the United States are doing today.
Donald Trump: (12:35)
All right.
Speaker 13: (12:37)
Very focused U-S bank, very focused on providing credit for small businesses.
Donald Trump: (12:40)
Right.
Speaker 13: (12:40)
They are the ones right now who are going to, perhaps, have a little bit of struggles. So, getting credit to them rapidly and also being very lenient on repaying terms.
Donald Trump: (12:48)
That’s great. Thank you, very much. And, thank you all. Yes, please.
Speaker 14: (12:51)
Mr. president, you’ve heard that the financial system is strong and I start to echo that. But, for those listening, the country is really strong. You’ve done a fantastic job. Your administration. We’re adding jobs. We need to all be more diligent on the terms of our health management. We’re learning that out of this. This is a longterm lesson to learn.
Donald Trump: (13:10)
Right.
Speaker 14: (13:10)
But, at the end of the day, if you’re not in Central America, my view and very strong. And, we need to remind ourselves that part of getting through a challenge like this is about confidence and supporting each other. And, having hope for the future. And, for myself, I believe our best days are ahead. And, working together, we’ll make that happen.
Donald Trump: (13:28)
Thank you, very much. Thank you, very much.
Donald Trump: (13:32)
So, I’ll be making a statement tonight probably at eight o’clock. And, we’ll be starting some additional solutions. We made a great decision on China and Asia. And, they’re healing and they’re healing at a pretty good rate. And, happy about that. And, we could start to think about getting back involved in that part of the world. And, as you know, we have a another part of the world, Europe, that’s in very tough shape. It’s having a hard time right now with the virus.
Donald Trump: (14:05)
And, we’ll be making various decisions. You’ll be hearing about them at approximately eight o’clock tonight. Steve.
Steve: (14:13)
What sort of travel restrictions on Europe are you thinking?
Donald Trump: (14:15)
Well, I’ll be letting you know that a little bit later.
Speaker 15: (14:18)
Mr. president, are you going to be declaring a national disaster tonight?
Donald Trump: (14:21)
We’ll be talking about that later. All those things. We’re making a decision on.
Speaker 16: (14:25)
Mr. president, we’ve heard in the past of industries that are too big to fail. In your estimation, are the airlines, are the cruise lines, is the hotel industry to make them fail?
Donald Trump: (14:35)
I think they’re going to be great. I think the folks around this table are the ones that finance that. And, they understand and they’re great companies. But, we’re having to fix a problem that four weeks ago nobody ever thought would be a problem. Nobody. You read about them. You read about him from 1917 and you read about him from lots of other times. But, nobody thought that we would be seeing. We were just discussing that this came out of nowhere.
Donald Trump: (15:03)
And, actually, came out of China, which is the way it works. But, we are going to get the problem solved and the country is so strong. The institutions are so strong. You know, in the past you had problems with institutions. These are powerful institutions. They’re built up, they’re ready to go. And, I know they’ll be helping their customers during this short term period. We think it’s going to be a short term period.
Speaker 16: (15:26)
Do you mind if we ask the C-E-Os what they think a sort of stimulus package or measures might need to be?
Donald Trump: (15:31)
I don’t mind that. I mean, it’s actually a very good question. I was going to ask it myself. If you’ve been hearing about the various forms, Brian, of stimulus.
Brian Moynihan: (15:40)
Sure.
Donald Trump: (15:41)
Different. Very different forms of stimulus. What would you say would be good appropriate under these circumstances?
Brian Moynihan: (15:46)
Well, I think the first thing is to have fiscal stimulus in a time of stress is the absolutely right answer. I think anything that gets out to the most people. And, so, keeping people who are become underemployed or unemployed due to this, pull on their wages are somehow supplementing that through unemployment and other types of programs, we think as a key thing.
Brian Moynihan: (16:05)
Because, if you keep the broad group of American people with cash flow and money to buy goods and do things, the economy will be strong and those individuals will have other people we should take care of. No question. In all our companies, anybody who is out from this virus is getting paid for as long as it takes or anybody that has high risk, we’re all taking care of it.
Brian Moynihan: (16:22)
So, I’d focus first on that level. And, then, the second major thing is take care of the health care problem. Because, the healthcare problem is what generated confidence.
Donald Trump: (16:31)
That’s true.
Brian Moynihan: (16:31)
Between testing and building up the hospitals so they can receive and do great work as American medical community, hospital community can do with the patients is critical. So, other than the broad base of people in the hospitals, I think businesses and other things, we’ll get through this. But, if we take care of those things, this thing will correct pretty quickly.
Donald Trump: (16:50)
If we get rid of the problem quickly, everything solves itself. We don’t need stimulus. So, that’d be good. But, we are talking about various forms of stimulus. What would you think, Michael?
Michael Corbat: (17:02)
I think to add on to what Brian said, the support of small business is critical.
Donald Trump: (17:06)
Right.
Michael Corbat: (17:06)
You look at the employment and you look at the importance across our economy. And, unfortunately, right now small business is suffering from both sides. One is there’s been disruption in their supply chains in terms of receiving their goods that they need. And, the second, the other side is that there’s uncertainty from the demand side in terms of what the future holds.
Michael Corbat: (17:27)
So, I think, working with the banks in this room and well beyond the S-B-A to be able to put programs in place around forbearance to be able to, potentially, up the limits in terms of lending in these programs… and, again, I think they’re things that have been used before, effectively. And, I think we can do it again.
Donald Trump: (17:50)
All right. Thank you, very much. Ken, go ahead.
Ken: (17:51)
I think all of us in this room are fortunate. We’re in a position to take care of our workforce. And, I know that that large corporate America is there 110% for their employees, the weak spot or the smaller business that don’t have the financial flexibility. And, in particular, our workers who are part of the gig economy. How do we think about, we’re a necessary direct fiscal support to the individuals in our economy who are least secure in their employment? You work for I-B-M, life’s going to be fine. You work for Goldman Sachs, life’s going to be fine. And, if you are a part time or gig worker, this is a moment of real trial and this is where fiscal accommodation can be quite powerful.
Donald Trump: (18:29)
Right. I agree with that 100%. Anybody? Anybody?
Charles Scharf: (18:34)
I would say that stimulus is appropriate. I personally like what you had mentioned in terms of some form of adjustment of payroll tax. A holiday. Or, even a complete restructure. It is a regressive tax and it’s something that could help in the short run and the long term. And, help provide more support for the 70 plus percent of U-S that need some help in terms of more savings and stability of livelihood. And, so, here’s a chance, maybe, to do something to help the short run and the long term.
Donald Trump: (19:04)
I think so. I think the payroll tax would be great. Democrats are not in favor of it. I’ve tried to figure out why. Because, it would be something that would be very good for the citizens, for the people. And, even longer term, for the country. So, that’s a tax that people have long been talking about either cutting or getting rid of entirely. So, Steve, what do you have?
Steve: (19:28)
All right. Just say it’s great to always have the bankers in because you have tremendous visibility into the economy and what’s going on and we are interested in hearing that feedback, particularly, at small and medium sized businesses in particular industries. We’ve cataloged for the president all of his executive authorities, which are quite significant. So, there’ll be various proposals. He’ll be rolling out quickly on that front. And, we’re also working with Congress on a bipartisan basis to be able to immediately help small and medium size businesses as well.
Donald Trump: (19:59)
Thank you, very much.
Speaker 18: (19:59)
What do you say to Americans who are concerned that you’re not taking this seriously enough? And, that some of your statements don’t match what your health experts are saying?
Donald Trump: (20:07)
That’s C-N-N. Fake news. Go ahead. Thank you, very much, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
Speaker 19: (20:09)
We’re done. We’re finished. Guys, lets go.
Speaker 20: (20:19)
Open that door. Let’s go. Let’s go, guys. Let’s go, guys.
Donald Trump: (20:20)
Thank you, very much. Eight o’clock tonight. Eight o’clock tonight.
Speaker 20: (20:26)
This way. Thanks, guys. All right, Jim. Thank you, Jim.
Donald Trump: (20:27)
We’ll be another five, very shortly. But, around here.
Speaker 21: (20:29)
Economic or health announcement?
Donald Trump: (20:32)
Within 50 feet.
Speaker 21: (20:32)
Economic or health announcement?
Donald Trump: (20:32)
Both.
Speaker 21: (20:32)
Both.
Speaker 20: (20:32)
All right, guys, let’s go.
Donald Trump: (20:38)
Thank you."
"Mar 6, 2020",Uknown,"Steve Monroe: (00:29)
The novel coronavirus and the Chinese to their credit made that sequence information available right away. Ours coronavirus experts here at CDC used that sequence information to design a test so that we would be able to detect the virus, even though at that time there were no cases in the US and we had no samples of the virus because we had no clinical material.
Steve Monroe: (00:51)
And so we quickly went from designing the test and the materials were made in these laboratories. The quality control is done here, and then our scientists use that to validate that it would work against what they could make as the coronavirus using just the sequence information, but importantly so that it would not detect other things because we want a positive to only be for the coronavirus, not for other kinds of viruses that create similar respiratory samples.
Donald Trump: (01:20)
Does everybody understand that?
Speaker 1: (01:21)
Then can we ask some questions please?
Donald Trump: (01:23)
Yeah, sure. Just one second. Let him finish up.
Steve Monroe: (01:25)
And then in relatively short order, as the information coming out of China indicated that this was more serious than was originally thought, originally seven cases, we stood up our incident management system here at CDC so that we would have all the right components together; the epidemiology, the laboratory, the communications, the policy funds, and then once it became clear that it was even more serious, that’s when we started to work with our colleagues at FDA to say, we need to make this test available to the larger public health laboratory community, and so worked with FDA to then-
Donald Trump: (02:01)
Just tell them about how have you done with the testing [crosstalk 00:02:03]-
Steve Monroe: (02:02)
To get what we call emergency use authorization so that we could distribute the test to our, originally to our public health laboratory counterparts. And now working with the commercial manufacturers, we’re in position to scale up that production beyond what we can do with our own facility here so that there’s the capacity to test more and more Americans and we are as we work today, to qualify more of those materials to go out.
Steve Monroe: (02:32)
And it’s important to note that at no time during this response has CDC ever denied a request that came from a public health official, either state or local, to test a patient. So all the patients who needed to be tested, in the opinion of the public health officials, have been tested.
Donald Trump: (02:50)
They have plenty of materials is what you’re saying?
Steve Monroe: (02:52)
Yeah. All of our state labs now have the ability to test for this virus-
Donald Trump: (02:56)
And they have had. Doctor, do you want to make a little statement?
Speaker 2: (03:00)
What was your name again sir?
Steve Monroe: (03:01)
Dr. Steve Monroe.
Robert Redfield: (03:04)
Well, I think I first I want to thank you for your decisive leadership in helping us put public health first. I also want to thank you for coming here today and encouraging and bringing energy to the men and women that you see that work every day to try to keep America safe. So I think that’s the most important thing I want to say sir.
Donald Trump: (03:22)
Thank you, I appreciate it, and the whole situation is … The testing has been amazing actually, what they’ve been able to produce in such a short period of time. You had mentioned four million tests before? Four million?
Steve Monroe: (03:35)
By the end of the week hopefully, we’ll be-
Alex Azar: (03:38)
The following, next week.
Steve Monroe: (03:39)
And the following week will be-
Donald Trump: (03:40)
What number will it be?
Alex Azar: (03:41)
Up to four million tests available to the United States by the end of next week. We’ve got commercial labs are getting validated as we speak. By the end of this weekend, we’ll, as promised, have enough testing that CDC has produced for to test 75000 people is already out and then enough tests for another million tests to be done and that’s … Most of that is shipped. The last lots are here being validated by Dr. Monroe’s team as we speak.
Robert Redfield: (04:09)
The one thing I would like to add, the purpose of all of this as Dr. Monroe said, is to have the capacity to detect the unknown. These labs developed tests for Zika, SARS, MERS, and now this coronavirus. And I think it really is remarkable the capacity we had here. Once we got the sequence, I think this lab team had a functional test in about seven days that they then worked with the FDA to make sure it was regulated. I think it’s … That’s really what we do.
Donald Trump: (04:38)
And they started working when they saw there was a problem in China, that was many weeks ago. So they saw there was something going on in China long before anybody even heard of it. That was actually before it was even in the print. They heard there was a problem in China. That’s when they started working on this and that’s pretty incredible. That’s why we’re in good shape.
Speaker 1: (04:59)
Sir, is coronavirus contained in the United States?
Donald Trump: (04:59)
Doctor?
Robert Redfield: (05:04)
Yeah. I think at this point again, and we’ve said this before, the secretary can add, the overall risk to the American public does remain low. And again I think we owe a lot to the decisive decisions initially to have travel restrictions and a number of areas of screening in airports. And then the most important is to get the public health community to do the early case recognition, isolation and contact [inaudible 00:05:28], which again, the fact that we now had a test, allowed us to do that a lot more effectively if we didn’t have a test.
Robert Redfield: (05:35)
We do have some areas where there’s significant community transmission now. Obviously we’ve seen that in the Seattle area and we’ve seen it in parts of California. We’re working hard with the local state health departments and those groups to continue to try to control this infection in that area. I think as the president said, or maybe the secretary, we still have only around 200 cases that we’ve diagnosed in the United States. We’re going to see more cases because we’re getting more diagnostics out there. But I would say that again, what I said before that at the present time, the general risk to the American public remains low.
Robert Redfield: (06:12)
We’re going to concentrate and help those communities though that are now fighting the battle. Like in the state of Washington, some of you were there I think the other day when we were out there so.
Reporters: (06:21)
I have a question for Dr. Monroe please. Would you admit that the CDC did have problems with the testing? You say that there were people who, that these health officials never had to request [inaudible 00:06:32] the test but you set such strict guidelines so people were coming in and saying they couldn’t get the test. And we talked to dozens of people that have contacted us saying they couldn’t get the test even though they had the symptoms because they didn’t meet your criteria because your tests were faulty.
Steve Monroe: (06:46)
So we did learn shortly after redistributed the first batch of our tests to the some of the state health labs that there was an issue with one component of the test. And so we quickly put together a team to try to figure out what that issue was and we suggested that people not test until we could sort that out. But what we have are three different signatures that we test for. And we, in working with FDA colleagues, we identified that two of those were sufficient to have a positive conclusive test. And so we’ve moved forward now with testing with just the two signatures.
Steve Monroe: (07:21)
This is something that could easily happen where we’re just against starting from scratch with sequence information, building a test rather rapidly. We did small scale testing here before rolling it out because our goal was to get it out to the public health labs as quickly as possible.
Reporters: (07:42)
But you didn’t have to start from scratch. You could have just used the WHO’s test. Why did you choose to start from scratch when [inaudible 00:07:42] the process?
Steve Monroe: (07:43)
But we started with our tests probably at the same time the Germans and the other Italians and the other groups that have worked with WHO were developing their tests. Nobody could start with test development until the sequence information was made available by the Chinese.
Reporters: (07:57)
Right, but there’s didn’t have any faults.
Robert Redfield: (07:59)
I would like-
Reporters: (08:00)
[crosstalk 00:08:00] so what do we [crosstalk 00:08:00]?
Robert Redfield: (08:00)
I’d like to make one thing clear.
Reporters: (08:01)
Please.
Robert Redfield: (08:02)
When this test was developed in really very rapid time, it was first offered here at CDC. So all the public health labs of this nation could use CDC as we do when any new disease comes and we can help them understand if this new pathogen is in that individual. That was available as soon as our test was approved by the FDA. Not a faulty test, a very accurate test, but the challenge was you had to send the sample here to CDC. That’s the same test we use today. So no state lab never had no access. They always have the ability to send it here.
Reporters: (08:39)
But they had to send it here because there were false readings.
Robert Redfield: (08:43)
No, they had to send it here because that’s how we started it. Then we developed the test to expand and in the manufacturing there was … And after that, we shipped it out to the states to see if they could verify did it work. We found that in some of the States that didn’t work, we figured out why. I don’t consider that a fault. I consider that doing quality control. I consider that success, making sure this test was going to perform out there with the same proficiency that it performed here.
Donald Trump: (09:10)
And now it’s all performing perfectly.
Robert Redfield: (09:11)
Yes sir.
Reporters: (09:11)
And President Trump, are you confident in the CDC?
Donald Trump: (09:12)
Just so you understand, now it’s all performing perfect.
Reporters: (09:15)
And do you have confidence in the CDC [crosstalk 00:09:17]?
Donald Trump: (09:18)
They’re fantastic people. These are fantastic people. Now it’s performing very well and it has been performing very well. And as you said, you had two of the three that worked perfectly and that’s all you need is two of the group. In fact, you could have one of the three and it would work. So we had two of the three but now it’s performing perfectly in all cases.
Reporters: (09:35)
[inaudible 00:09:36]-
Alex Azar: (09:36)
Dr. Monroe, could you explain on the testing criteria how that compares? You’ve explained to the president, how they compared to China and international standards.
Steve Monroe: (09:45)
Right. So early on it and when we submit our tests to the FDA for emergency use authorization, we have to specify what are the conditions under which a person should be tested. And certainly at the beginning, we wanted it to be clear that all of the cases at that time were associated with travel to one of the endemic areas or other things like that.
Steve Monroe: (10:07)
And so the criteria in the package insert were strict about who could be tested because we didn’t want just a lot of people with compatible symptoms who had no history of exposure to be tested. But as was stated, there was never a time when a public health official contacted CDC to ask testing and it was not a done, even if they didn’t quite meet the strict definition [crosstalk 00:10:34].
Alex Azar: (10:34)
I understand even China had a geographic travel restriction on who they tested and they were the epicenter. Is that right Dr. Monroe?
Steve Monroe: (10:43)
Right. At the very beginning, they were only testing people who had a direct contact at the seafood market in Wuhan.
Speaker 3: (10:48)
Is there a chance that the limited testing means that the numbers are low and the public has been misled about how widespread this is?
Robert Redfield: (10:58)
Yeah. We have been diagnosing cases here from the beginning originally linked to travel, associated with very aggressive public health measures of contact tracing. So you might find one confirmed case and you might evaluate another 300 people all right? And as we went out to do that, the only contacts initially from the beginning that we found were two spouses of spouses who came back from Wuhan and all the other contacts were negative. Over time, when the state of Washington sent a sample from an individual, they made the first diagnosis. That individual was also a traveler, but clearly as they continued to diagnose more, we found people that had no risk through travel and this is what we call community spread.
Robert Redfield: (11:49)
So we do have community spread. We are continuing to look. We are enhancing our surveillance. We’re blending surveillance for coronavirus into our flu surveillance system. But at this point, I think we have isolated a number of clusters, but it’s not as if we have multiple, multiple hundreds and hundreds of clusters around the United States.
Speaker 4: (12:09)
[inaudible 00:12:09].
Donald Trump: (12:11)
I do think what’s happening though is you have people that are sick but they don’t go to the hospital or they’re not very sick. It’s a more minor case and it could be of this virus. But we have a lot of people that aren’t going to the hospital so we’re not seeing those people. And if you did see those people, I believe, [inaudible 00:12:29] service, the statistics actually become much better because they heal, they get better. They don’t see a doctor, they don’t see a hospital. They have a problem, they have the sniffles or a cold or [inaudible 00:12:40], some of the symptoms, and over a period of time, a short period of time or even a longer period of time, they get better.
Donald Trump: (12:47)
If you look at that, then all of a sudden you’re coming into a much lower category of risk in terms of death type risk. Because I think a lot of people aren’t going to the doctors, a lot of people aren’t going to hospitals and so you’re not seeing those people.
Alex Azar: (13:01)
And Mr. President, you wouldn’t have seen this. But actually today, Dr. Fauci published in the New England Journal of Medicine, a revised estimate of fatality counts very much consistent with what the president was saying, which is the WHO numbers are just a math problem. This many people died, this many were diagnosed. But if you then extrapolate to from the number of diagnosed to how many likely cases there are that never came to the doctor or hospital or got tested, Dr. Fauci’s paper in the New England Journal says he thinks it’s less than 1% which is I think word for word Mr. President, what you were saying.
Reporters: (13:36)
Can I just ask one question about containment? You’re saying that you have [crosstalk 00:13:40] seen these clusters, but from last Friday to today we’ve gone from something like 57 or 59 cases, in seven days we have 200, and we even haven’t had the testing to see if there are more than that. So now we’re actually getting the testing, don’t you think it’s likely there are a lot more people out there who are going to come and actually be sick?
Robert Redfield: (14:02)
I think there’s no doubt we’re going to see more community cases. And I just want to say, and there’s no doubt that the public health system of the United States is enhancing surveillance in a variety of ways to try to really understand is there any hidden pockets. That’s all in process, but I will say everyone has been aggressively using the single case they diagnosed then to go look at all the contacts to try to begin to understand this. This is how the nursing home is.
Robert Redfield: (14:34)
A lot of infections in Seattle and tragically, and they’re all in our prayers, a number of deaths for that nursing home. So I just want to assure the American public that we are enhancing our surveillance, not just CDC, but the entire public health system of this nation, so that we will have very accurate eyes on where this virus is.
Speaker 5: (14:53)
Obviously Mr. President we’ve talked a lot about the health ramifications and of course it’s very important, but there are also economic ramifications. The stock market [inaudible 00:15:03] at the end of the day, then the travel industry, airlines, cruise ships, their companies, travel companies have been hit especially hard. Can you give us a sense of what your considering to help offset [inaudible 00:15:13]?
Donald Trump: (15:16)
Well, we’re considering different but we’re also considering the fact that last year you had approximately 36000 deaths due to what’s called the flu. When I first heard this four or five, six weeks ago, when I was hearing the amount of people that died of the flu, I was shocked to hear anywhere from 27000 to 70000 or 77000, and I guess they said in 1990, that wasn’t particular very bad. It was higher than that. As of the time I left the plane with you, we had 240 cases, that’s at least what was on a very fine network known as Fox News. I know you love it, but that’s what I happened to be watching. And how was the show last night? Did it get good ratings by the way?
Speaker 5: (16:00)
[inaudible 00:00:16:00].
Donald Trump: (16:02)
Oh really? I heard it broke [inaudible 00:16:03] records but maybe-
Peter: (16:03)
I [inaudible 00:16:00]
Donald Trump: (16:03)
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I heard you broke all [inaudible 00:16:00] records, but maybe that’s wrong. That’s what they told me. I don’t know. I can’t imagine that. But what happened is if you look at the number, the time we left, it was 240 cases, Peter, and 11 deaths. That’s what it has been. You look at throughout the world, I mean other countries have.. South Korea and Italy, and in particular, China, have many.
Donald Trump: (16:24)
Now, I also hear their numbers are getting much better in those places and I’ve heard their numbers are getting much better in China, but I hear their numbers are getting much in Italy, et cetera, et cetera. But when I hear…
Donald Trump: (16:34)
So we have 240 cases, 11 deaths, everything is too much and it’s true. I don’t want 11 deaths. I don’t want any deaths. Over the last long period of time, when people have the flu, you have an average of 36,000 people dying. I never heard those numbers. I would have been shocked. I would have said does anybody die from the flu? I didn’t know people died from the flu. 36,000 people died. 27,000 to 77,000, that’s your flu. And again, you had a couple of years where it was over 100,000 people died from the flu.
Donald Trump: (17:09)
So I start to say I wonder what’s going on here. Now, if you look at the percentage, the percentage for the flu is under 1%, but this could also be under 1% because many of the people that aren’t that sick don’t report, so they’re not putting those people in there, and you’re smiling when I say that.
Donald Trump: (17:24)
Who are you from, by the way? Which?
Reporters: (17:25)
I’m from CNN.
Donald Trump: (17:25)
You are? I don’t watch CNN, that’s why I don’t recognize you.
Reporters: (17:31)
Oh, okay. Well, nice to meet you.
Donald Trump: (17:32)
[crosstalk 00:17:32] I don’t watch it. I don’t watch CNN because CNN is fake news. Go ahead.
Speaker 6: (17:36)
Maybe just address the economic piece though because there is obviously a lot of [crosstalk 00:17:39]
Donald Trump: (17:39)
Of course it’s an effect. It is an effect. Now, you know if you know anything about me, I like when people happen to stay in the United States and spend their money in the United States. So I think people are staying in the United States more, they’re going to spend their money in the United States, [inaudible 00:17:52] this is ended. It will end. People have to remain calm.
Donald Trump: (17:57)
I do think that if you look at the numbers and you look at the numbers from other years or on other things and you look at these numbers, it’ll be interesting to see what you find and statistics will soon be coming out. But there was a big statistic today that it’s way under 1%. It said one-tenth of 1% in one case, but nobody really knows. We’ll be able to find out.
Donald Trump: (18:18)
The problem is for people to get better that don’t see a doctor or don’t go to a hospital, those people get better if they were in the numbers. The numbers would look much better in terms of death rate.
Speaker 6: (18:27)
Are you concerned there’ll be some bankruptcies [crosstalk 00:18:30]
Donald Trump: (18:30)
Oh, I think you’ll have other things. The amazing thing, and look at the job numbers today. We had a tremendous job number today.
Donald Trump: (18:37)
We had a number that when you add last month’s number, which was a correction of plus 80,000 jobs, wasn’t it a 350,000 jobs number today? That was shocking. I was watching a particular network and they said on the net, but they’re pros, they said, “Wow, these are unbelievable numbers.” They were shocked by the numbers. Over 350,000, when you add last month’s correction. Peter?
Peter: (19:02)
[inaudible 00:19:02] all these organizations are canceling events [inaudible 00:19:05] study abroad programs. All the organizations and businesses that are canceling conventions and meetings and travel [inaudible 00:19:12] within the United States, are they overreacting or are they taking the right precautions?
Donald Trump: (19:17)
I think it’s fine if they want to do it. I don’t think it’s an overreaction, but I wouldn’t be generally inclined to do it. I really wouldn’t be. Now, it depends on what country you’re talking about. If you’re talking about if they’re going to another country, or are you talking about within the United States?
Peter: (19:30)
Even within the United States, a lot of [crosstalk 00:19:31]
Donald Trump: (19:33)
Yeah, they have to feel comfortable. People have to feel comfortable to have a good time. If you look at do I want to go to China, do I want to go to certain parts of Italy, do I want to go to South Korea, right now? That’s a different decision. But you have some parts of the world and some parts, many, most parts of the country.
Donald Trump: (19:49)
In this big vast land of ours, this great country of ours, we have 240 cases. Most of those people are going to be fine. A vast majority are going to be fine. We’ve had 11 deaths and they’ve been largely old people who were susceptible to what’s happening. Now, that would be the case, I assume, with a regular flu too. If somebody is old and in a weakened state or ill, they’re susceptible to the common flu too. They would tell me just now that the common flu kills people and old people is sort of the target.
Speaker 7: (20:25)
And also, the very young.
Donald Trump: (20:26)
And the young. Now, the interesting thing here, it’s very interesting. The interesting thing here is that the young seem to be doing unbelievable well. Actually, better than they do with the flu. Young people and very young people are doing very well, which is another thing I guess they’re trying to figure out.
Reporters: (20:42)
And Mr. [crosstalk 00:20:43] you were shaking a lot of hands today, taking a lot of close pictures. Are you protecting yourself at all?
Donald Trump: (20:47)
Not at all.
Reporters: (20:47)
How are you staying away from germs?
Donald Trump: (20:49)
No, not at all. Not at all. I’m a person that was never big on a handshaking deal throughout my life. They used to criticize me for it, or laugh about it or have fun with it. But if you’re a politician, like I walk in and the doctors have their hands out, Hello, sir, how you?” If you don’t shake hands, they’re not going to like you too much, and I guess that’s my business. I never thought I’d be a politician. I guess I’m a politician, but the fact is I feel very secure. I feel very secure.
Speaker 8: (21:16)
Can anybody tell us what happened to you last night and today that [inaudible 00:21:19] canceled [inaudible 00:21:20] what happened here [crosstalk 00:21:22]
Donald Trump: (21:22)
I was told that one person maybe that works someplace in the building that I’m not even sure what level, but that one person may have had the virus. And therefore, they said, sir, because of the fact that one person may have had the… It’s a big building with a lot of great scientists, frankly. One person had the virus, and that turned out to be a negative report. That turned out to be negative, and so they called me but it was already canceled. But this morning, I said, wait a minute, I’m going to Tennessee. We’re going down to Florida to have a meeting on Monday as you know, and so we’re going to Florida. I’d love to stop, the CDC. That was a big deal with Secret Service, but they’re fantastic and they worked it out, so we stopped. But it was a report, and the person, it was a negative diagnosis.
Speaker 9: (22:09)
Mr. President [inaudible 00:22:10] on Monday has been canceled because of the coronavirus and you were supposed to speak?
Donald Trump: (22:13)
No, we had another big deal. There were two of them, and there was a thing that we recommended because there was a lot of people, and we recommended that they let them cancel that one. But there was another one in a similar area.
Speaker 9: (22:26)
Have you considered not having campaign rallies? Like you [crosstalk 00:22:30]
Donald Trump: (22:30)
No, I haven’t.
Speaker 9: (22:30)
… Michigan, this coming week [crosstalk 00:22:32]
Donald Trump: (22:32)
Well, I’ll tell you what, I haven’t had any problem filling them. We just had one in North Carolina, South Carolina, all over the place, and we have tens of thousands of people standing outside the arenas. So we haven’t had…
Reporters: (22:44)
Is there a risk if there’s that many people close together?
Donald Trump: (22:45)
It doesn’t bother me at all, and it doesn’t bother them at all.
Speaker 7: (22:50)
What should be done about that cruise ship that’s [crosstalk 00:22:53]
Donald Trump: (22:53)
Well, that’s a big question. So I was just on the phone with Vice President and they’re trying to make a decision. Frankly, if it were up to me, I would be inclined to say leave everybody on the ship for a period of time and you use the ship as your base, but a lot of people would rather do it a different way. They’d rather quarantine people on the land. Now, when they do that, our numbers are going to go up. Our numbers are going to go up. The 240 is going to go up, and I assume that perhaps it’s a very big ship with thousands of people on it, including the sailors and the crew. You’re talking about a massive number of people. That is a big ship.
Donald Trump: (23:31)
If it were up to me, I would do it that way. A lot of people think we should do it the other way. They’re Americans. They’re mostly Americans, and we have to take care of Americans.
Speaker 7: (23:40)
The other way being take them off the ship [crosstalk 00:23:41]
Donald Trump: (23:41)
Bring them off the ship.
Donald Trump: (23:43)
No, they’ll be under quarantine and they’ll be tested very carefully. Everyone is tested very carefully. Somebody said today… In fact, the Governor said a story that a friend of yours, Governor Kemp? A friend of yours was saying how tough it is to get into the United States with all of the testing. Maybe you’d like to say.
Brian Kemp: (24:01)
Yes. So John Seldon, who is running the general manager of Atlanta International-Hartsfield Airport, he is on our coronavirus taskforce here and he did a great job yesterday in our press conference, explaining the procedures that the President and others had put in place to make sure that everybody that’s coming from Northern Italy and South Korea are being screened multiple times before they get on the airplane. I think that just gives people great confidence as they’re traveling through all the airports across the country that the people that are coming in have been screened from those problem areas. The [inaudible 00:24:40] and border people are checking them as well and having conversations. I think they may have tested one person in the Atlanta Airport. They have over 300,000 people go through there a day. That test was negative and so it is safe to travel right now.
Brian Kemp: (24:55)
People just need to be very careful, do the things that the CDC and Dr. Redfield and Secretary Azar and the Vice President and his taskforce are telling people to do, and that’s keep your hands clean. Just be careful where you’re going. If you’re sick, don’t go to the airport. Don’t go to the sporting event.
Donald Trump: (25:13)
But he was very impressed with how hard it is to get on the plane. He was tested two times, and then one person said three times, just to come in. We’re watching it very closely. The people are doing a good job and instead of being negative, you should be positive. These scientists are doing a phenomenal job with something that came from out of nowhere, a very short time ago.
Reporters: (25:34)
I’m not trying to be negative. I’m trying to help people understand when they can get the test, and I want to ask Secretary Azar because he said most of them ahead shipped out. Can you tell me exactly how many people as of right now can be tested? You told me yesterday, you thought it would be 475,000. How many kits have been shipped, and how many people do you think can we test [crosstalk 00:25:51]
Alex Azar: (25:51)
Well, you got the CDC Director, who is doing it.
Reporters: (25:54)
Okay, great. Okay, thanks. Perfect.
Alex Azar: (25:54)
Why don’t we have Dr. Redfield talk to you? You may believe him. You won’t believe me. Why don’t you talk to Dr. Redfield? No.
Donald Trump: (25:57)
It’s all right. It’s all right.
Robert Redfield: (26:00)
We continue to send… Excuse me.
Brian Kemp: (26:02)
No, no. Yeah. [crosstalk 00:26:03]
Robert Redfield: (26:03)
I’ll stand right here.
Brian Kemp: (26:03)
You’re all right.
Robert Redfield: (26:06)
We continue. Our first responsibility, the CDC, as I said was to develop the eyes for the lab test. Second responsibility is to get that out to the public health community and we have now shipped out… I think it was enough to 75,000 people into the public health labs now?
Donald Trump: (26:23)
Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That’s what the bottom line is.
Brian Kemp: (26:26)
And I would just say that we started testing in our lab in Georgia, our Department of Public Health, yesterday, which is a day earlier. We thought it would be today, so we are actually testing today.
Reporters: (26:35)
Great.
Robert Redfield: (26:36)
And the second group was to get… How do you get tests into the clinical arena? Since our role was to get it in the public health arena, and the FDA, the Secretary, under his leadership was able to take the test that CDC developed and one of the companies said they want to develop it and sell it. And that’s what the Secretary referred to, that…
Reporters: (26:57)
Yeah [inaudible 00:26:58]
Robert Redfield: (26:58)
Yeah. And by the end of this week, they were supposed to have about a million, 1.2 million tests out.
Alex Azar: (27:03)
About a million. Yeah, a million tests. So they shipped 700,000 already, the remaining lots are actually being tested here. Dr. Monroe has got them as of, I think, 10:30 this morning, and they have to do the quality control. And then, if they pass, they ship.
Donald Trump: (27:15)
But I think importantly, anybody right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test, gets a test. They’re there. They have the test, and the tests are beautiful. Anybody that needs a test, gets a test. If there’s a doctor that wants to test, if there is somebody coming off a ship like the big monster ship that’s out there, right now. Which, again, that’s a big decision, do I want to bring all those people on? People would like me to do that. I don’t like the idea of doing it, but anybody that needs a test can have a test.
Donald Trump: (27:49)
They’re all set. They have them out there. In addition to that, they’re making millions of more as we speak. But as of right now and yesterday, anybody that needs a test, that’s the important thing and the tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect. The transcription was perfect, right? This was not as perfect as that, but pretty good.
Robert Redfield: (28:11)
I want to add. I want to add one. I want to add.
Speaker 10: (28:13)
Is South Korea [crosstalk 00:28:14]
Donald Trump: (28:14)
We’re handling it from South Korea. We’re testing that you can’t come in from South Korea unless they go through.
Speaker 10: (28:18)
But are they handling it better than we [crosstalk 00:28:20]
Donald Trump: (28:21)
I’d have to ask the doctors.
Robert Redfield: (28:21)
Before that, I just wanted to add one other thing to the availability of clinical tests. The Secretary and the Vice President, last week, brought together all of the major diagnostic companies that you all know so well. Labcorp, Quest, and asked them to come together as a group and they already formed a consortia to work together to use their capacity, which is really substantial, to bring this tests to doctors’ offices around our nation. And when they presented it, they felt that either by Monday, they’re going to begin to roll out this test now through Labcorp, through Quest.
Robert Redfield: (29:02)
So as the President said, the issue now is whether the clinicians believe that this is indicated in evaluating the patients that come to see them. It’s not going to be about the availability of the test. It’s going to be about the clinical judgment of the patient and the doctor, or the nurse practitioner to get this test.
Reporters: (29:19)
Can I clarify about the [crosstalk 00:29:21]
Donald Trump: (29:24)
And this is, by the way, the highest level test.
Robert Redfield: (29:26)
Yes.
Reporters: (29:26)
Could I clarify something?
Donald Trump: (29:26)
This is the highest level test anywhere.
Reporters: (29:26)
About the cruise ship, has a decision been made?
Donald Trump: (29:34)
That’s a very good question.
Reporters: (29:35)
And are u the final decider?
Donald Trump: (29:37)
From my… Yes. From my standpoint, I want to rely on people. I have great experts, including our Vice President who is working 24 hours a day on this stuff. They would like to have the people come off. I’d rather have the people stay, but I’d go with them. I told them to make the final decision. I would rather it because I like the numbers being where they are, I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault, and it wasn’t the fault of the people on the ship either. It wasn’t their fault either, and they’re mostly Americans, so I can live either way with it. I’d rather have them stay on, personally, but I fully understand if they want to take them off. I gave them the authority to make the decision.
Speaker 7: (30:22)
Isn’t that putting preference over having more attractive numbers over having [crosstalk 00:30:28]
Donald Trump: (30:27)
No. No. No, I’m saying whatever it is, that takes precedence over the numbers. No. I like the numbers. I would rather have the numbers stay where they are. But if they want to take them off, they’ll take them off. But if that happens, all of a sudden your 240 is obviously going to be a much higher number and probably the 11 will be a higher number too.
Speaker 7: (30:46)
There must be some risk in leaving them on the ship, right?
Donald Trump: (30:50)
There is probably risk to both. Probably risk to both.
Reporters: (30:57)
Is there going to be a way for us to advance our test in the way that South Korea has? They have the drive-through testing now [crosstalk 00:31:02]
Donald Trump: (31:02)
We’re working very closely with South Korea.
Reporters: (31:06)
10,000 people a day?
Donald Trump: (31:06)
Yeah.
Reporters: (31:06)
And are we going to be [crosstalk 00:31:06] capacity?
Donald Trump: (31:06)
Well, we’re working closely with South Korea. They’re also in a much different position. They have a lot of people that are infected. We don’t. They’re in a much different position, but we are working very closely with South Korea. As you know, we’re allies, even though they’ve made much better trade deals in the past than we did. We’re allies with South Korea. You have heard that, right? And we’re working very closely with South Korea.
Reporters: (31:27)
Yeah. [crosstalk 00:31:28] capabilities
Donald Trump: (31:29)
And a lot of the testing is very similar testing, but they’re in a much different position than we… They have thousands of people and they’ve got some difficult right now, but we’re working very closely. In fact, they’re calling us, asking us and these people for advice.
Alex Azar: (31:45)
And if I… And please correct me, Doctors, if I’m wrong. If I understand correctly, South Korea is using a technology different than what we use in the United States in our public health labs, but that we do use in our commercial labs. The Labcorp, the Quests, the Roches, the Abbotts, and that’s exactly…
Alex Azar: (32:03)
For the Quest’s, the Roche’s, the Abbott’s, and that’s exactly what Dr. Redfield was saying. If we’d been able to get up and running right away that… Am I saying that correctly, Dr. Monroe?
Steve Monroe: (32:09)
Yeah, just one point of clarification, the South Koreans I recall, they’re doing drive through sample collection, so this is not like a pregnancy test where you drive through, they take a swab, and they tell you on the spot if it’s positive or negative. They’re using that as a way to collect samples from a large number of people, and then they’re using the high throughput testing platforms in order to do the testing.
Reporters: (32:31)
And that testing platform is what you’re saying is available through Quest and so it will likely be available starting Monday we think when they’re up and running.
Robert Redfield: (32:39)
And I think it’s important just to emphasize again back to the role that CDC had to support the public health labs. We have built the laboratory capacity throughout our public health labs to monitor for flu and other respiratory viral systems. The platform that does that is the platform of the test that we developed. It wouldn’t have helped us to develop a test in the public health labs, and they have none of the instrumentation. We develop using that platform for public health labs. Platform that the secretary and Dr. Monroe was saying is a high throughput platform, which has been put in most hospitals for HIV, Hepatitis C and so that’s the platform. And as we sit here today, we’re trying to now validate whether the test we made would be validated to use that on that platform? But the private sector is already doing it too. I mean they’re moving now to that rapid throughput platform.
Donald Trump: (33:32)
And don’t forget these are the people as an example HIV, I talked about it in speeches and other things, HIV free or essentially free within nine years now it’s a ten year process. These are the people that came up with the answers to this stuff that three years ago, four years ago you would’ve said it’s impossible. What they’ve done is incredible and to others also. If you look at what they’ve done with HIV, it’s incredible. Other countries are all calling the same people that you’re dealing with. And honestly, what you should be doing is giving them a lot of credit because this was a very condensed period of time. Even the vaccine, they’re going to have tests done in 90 days that two years ago you were taking two years to do. And their making great progress. It takes a period of time, but they’re making great progress. Other countries are dealing with the same people you’re talking to now and others in this government universe they’re incredible people, and honestly, you should be giving them tremendous credit. They have done a tremendous job.
Donald Trump: (34:35)
When you mentioned South Korea, they’re dealing with us all the time. When you mentioned Italy they’re dealing with us all the time. We’re working together with China. We’re working together with everybody. But these are great people. These are incredible people, and you shouldn’t be knocking them. You should be praising them. They have done an incredible job already.
Reporters: (34:52)
Last night you said you had anticipated this kind of thing happening. Do you think that having the office pandemic preparation in the White House that everyone on staff [inaudible 00:35:02].
Donald Trump: (35:03)
I just think this is something, Peter, that you can never really think is going to happen. I’ve heard all about this could be a big deal from before it happened. Something like this could happen. I think we’re doing a really good job in this country at keeping it down. We’ve really been very vigilant, and we’ve done a tremendous job at keeping it down. But who would’ve thought, look how long ago is it? Six, seven, eight weeks ago? Who would’ve thought, would he be having this subject? We were going to hit 30,000 on the Dow. Like it was clockwork, right? It was all going, it was right up, and then all of a sudden this came out.
Donald Trump: (35:43)
All I say is be calm, we have the greatest people in the world. Everyone’s relying on us, the world is relying on us. They’ve done an incredible job in a very condensed period of time. The thing is you never really know when something like this is going to strike and what it’s going to be. This is different than something else. This is a very different thing than something else. So I think they’ve done a great job. And you know what if I didn’t think they did, I’d tell you.
Reporters: (36:06)
[inaudible 00:00:36:10].
Donald Trump: (36:11)
I just don’t think that somebody is going to, without seeing something like we saw something happening in China. As soon as they saw that happening, they essentially, not from the White House, we don’t need a lab in the White House, but they saw something happening. I found it very interesting. They spotted something going on in China. When you see these labs that I just saw, I would love to have them see it if it’s possible, but they spotted something going on in China. They started working on it immediately. Just in case it should come here, and also to help China. I mean if we could find something that’s beneficial, we want to give it to China, like they’re going to want to give it to us. China’s working very closely with us, South Korea, Italy, all of them. They’ve been working very close here, but we’re doing, again 240 and 11 that’s where we are right now.
Reporters: (36:59)
Mr. President on the numbers, where are we now with the forecast?
Donald Trump: (37:04)
We don’t have a forecast because we don’t know. We don’t know how many people have this aren’t going to see a doctor, aren’t going to see a hospital. And the higher that number is, the better the number is from the standpoint of death, the death count. They get better without seeing doctors, without seeing the hospitals. So nobody’s marking it down and I think the number is very high. I think that number is much higher, but it never gets reported because they’re not going to hospitals or doctors. The ones that get reported are people that are really sick enough to go to a hospital or to a doctor. So it makes the numbers look worse.
Donald Trump: (37:43)
We’re prepared for anything, we’re prepared. We are really very highly prepared for anything. And in a short period of time, I mean what they’ve done is very incredible. And I’ve seen what they’ve done back there. It’s really incredible.
Reporters: (37:57)
Just from a health perspective.
Donald Trump: (37:58)
And by the way, NIH, what they’ve done, I spent time over there and I like this stuff. My uncle is a great person who was at MIT. He taught at MIT for I think a record number of years. He was a great, super genius. Dr. John Trump. I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, how do you know so much about this? Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for President. But you know what? What they’ve done is very incredible. I understand that whole world. I love that world. I really do. I love that world. And they should be given tremendous credit, and the whole world is relying on us.
Donald Trump: (38:41)
You hear about you’re saying about South Korea. South Korea’s very much reliant on the information we’re given them, and they’re reliant on the vaccines that we will come up with very soon we’re going to come up. Now it takes a period of time to get them tested and then put into the market. It has to be very safe. You can’t give a vaccine that’s going to be unsafe. It would be a disaster. So that’s where we are and I think these people deserve, all of them, the scientists, the doctors, I think they deserve tremendous credit. I really do.
Reporters: (39:13)
The vice president went to see the Seattle area yesterday.
Donald Trump: (39:16)
He did.
Reporters: (39:17)
And the Governor Inslee. He was very complimentary of Washington’s response. The governor was a little less complimentary of your response.
Donald Trump: (39:24)
So I told Mike not to be complimentary of the governor because that governor is a snake. Okay. Inslee. And I said, if you’re nice to him, he will take advantage. And I would have said no. Let me just tell you, we have a lot of problems with the governor and the governor of Washington that’s where you have many of your problems. Okay. So Mike may be happy with him, but I’m not. Okay. And he would say that naturally.
Donald Trump: (39:51)
And as I said last night at the town hall, if we came up with a cure today and tomorrow, everything is gone. And you went up to this governor who is not a good governor by the way. If you went up to this governor and you said to him, how did Trump do? He’d say he did a terrible job. It makes no difference. If we came up with a cure, right now and tomorrow everything ended at eight o’clock tomorrow morning, everything ended. He would say, Trump, did a horrible job. Okay. And I told Mike that would happen. I said, no matter how nice you are, he’s no good. That’s the way I feel. Goodbye. Good luck to CNN.
Reporters: (40:28)
I have one quick question just for the people who are watching who are concerned and have symptoms. Is it possible or is it a good thing or something that we’re looking into to be able to test people in mass like they’re doing in other countries so that they can just show up and get tested?
Donald Trump: (40:44)
They’re not testing. They’re sampling people in other countries.
Reporters: (40:46)
Then their testing.
Donald Trump: (40:48)
Excuse me. There’s a difference. I heard what he said. They’re sampling people. It’s a drive-by. They give samples. Now can we do that? Yeah, we can do that, but that’s not effective like what we’re doing. We’re doing the whole thing in one stop. They’re doing samples in South Korea. It’s a very different thing. Go ahead. Would you like to say something?
Robert Redfield: (41:06)
Well, I would just say we’re at a stage in our experience with this virus that we are still deeply focused on control. Some people use the word containment to control. And I said about the important principles of early diagnosis, isolation, and contact rates. And then now with some mitigation strategies, you see in different areas when they’re deciding should we close large gatherings? I think it’s important to use the data and the science that we have. I mean we’re not blind to where this virus is right now in the United States. And we need to focus our resources right now where we know this virus is circulating substantially in the community like certain parts of California, like certain parts of Seattle.
Robert Redfield: (41:57)
That’s where we need to put our focus. It would not be a service to our ability for our American response. If all of a sudden 20 million Americans that have no evidence of any risks that we’ve looked in those areas really don’t need that. That’s why we are accelerating as the President said our surveillance. I mean we’re going out and really testing people that have flu like symptoms, and we’re going to expand that from the sites we started to the whole nation.
Robert Redfield: (42:24)
So we’re going to have eyes on this and see. Whoops, this virus has now snuck up into Northern Maine. Whoops, we see it down in Kansas and that information will then be used by doctors to know if someone comes in with an upper respiratory flu, I better think about maybe testing for Coronavirus. So we really want to have the American people to have confidence. It’s not just in CDC, it’s in the public health community of this nation. It’s strong. They’re doing their job. I tell people every time we see a new confirmed case, they should think of that as a success, not a failure because they know their public health community’s out doing their job.
Donald Trump: (43:01)
The difference is that they’re being proactive. We are being proactive. We’re going out and looking for spots. Nobody else is doing that. Not by leaving samples or anything else. We’re going out and proactively looking to see where there’s a problem. We don’t have to do that, but we’re doing it to see if we can find areas which are trouble spots. I don’t even know if I agree with that. You’ll find out those areas just by sitting back and waiting, but they’re trying to find out before you would normally find out by waiting. And I think that’s great, but that’s what they’re doing.
Donald Trump: (43:36)
We’re the only country in that sense that’s proactive. We’re totally proactive, and we’re totally equipped to handle it.
Reporters: (43:41)
Is the strategy shifting from containment to risk mitigation?
Robert Redfield: (43:47)
So right now you shouldn’t think of it as one or the other. All right. And I’m going to say we need to stay committed to containment. And I still believe containment and control is the goal, but that’s going to be complimented strategically by what we call mitigation or non-pharmaceutical interventions. Like asking churches not to have big gatherings. So in the state of Washington in the last couple of days, they announced their initial mitigation strategies. We’ve been working on mitigation for the whole nation, just in a planning way. But we’ve also have our people buried into the Washington Health Department, the California Health Department, and have them start to develop.
Robert Redfield: (44:29)
And again, Washington started to operationalize theirs this week. I suspect California will later. We’re going to continue to work on these. And it’s going to be a community by community, community, community strategy. They’re not all going to be the same, but it’s going to be driven by the amount of community transmission that can’t be linked to a contact that can’t be linked to a trip. When you see significant, or we call on-link transmission then you start to have to evaluate the value. So it’s not one versus the other. But this nation should not give up on containment.
Donald Trump: (45:03)
Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much."
"Mar 4, 2020","THE PRESIDENT:  Wow.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It’s a great honor to have you at the White House, a very special place.  Beautiful and so meaningful in so many ways.  And our country has never done better.  You’re all doing really well.  Every state is doing well.  I can say most every state in the room today is setting records.  And we’d like to think that the federal government has been helping you a lot.","Donald Trump: (00:10)
And we’re talking about the effects of the virus on the air travel and what they see. In a certain way, you could say that the borders are automatically shut down without having to say shut down. To me, they’re to a certain extent automatically shut down. But it’s affecting the airline business as it would and a lot of people are staying in our country and they’re shopping and using our hotels in this country. So from that standpoint, I think probably there’s a positive impact, but there’s also an impact on overseas travel, which will be fairly substantial and Mike, maybe I’ll let you give a little briefing as to what we just discussed.
Mike Pence: (00:50)
Thank you, Mr. President. And grateful to have the opportunity to meet with the leaders of our airline industry today. Mr. President, you said from early on that we were going to have a whole of government approach, but the truth is as, evidenced by all these great industry leaders, it’s really a whole of America approach. And the American people deserve to know that according to all of our experts, the risks of the average American of contracting the coronavirus remains low. And that’s largely owing to your decision, Mr. President, to suspend all travel from China into the United States and to quarantine all Americans that are returning. It’s also owing to the tremendous cooperation of this industry, the airline industry, because in addition to suspending travel from China, you recently made the decision to designate as “do not travel” certain areas of Italy, certain areas of South Korea, but we also, at your direction, have worked with this industry so that now as of yesterday morning, all passengers on all direct flights from all airports in Italy or South Korea are being screened on multiple times before they board any of these airlines.
Mike Pence: (02:08)
We’re grateful for that, Mr. President. I know you are and everyone here should know that we’re going to continue to follow the facts and the data. Dr. Burks is working closely with all of our health officials to determine what additional screening might be required in the United States or in partners around the world. But our airlines are going to play a key role, Mr. President, in preventing the spread of this disease. And even earlier today at your direction, we met with leaders of our nursing home industry to talk about the measures, increased measures to prevent the spread of infectious disease. We’ve sent new guidance out to nursing homes. We’ll be announcing later today new priority of inspections for infectious diseases. We’re detailing that. We explained it to the industry today and also on the issue of testing, Mr. President, you’ve made that a priority. We’ll have over a million tests in the field today.
Mike Pence: (03:05)
I spoke to several governors this morning that were grateful for the fact that the changes you made this weekend through the FDA now make it possible for state health clinics as well as universities around the country to be able to conduct coronavirus tests. But we’ll also be meeting this afternoon with leaders of our commercial laboratories to make a coronavirus test more rapidly, more wildly available for doctors offices and medical clinics and consumers around the country. So Mr. President, as you said, it is a whole of government approach, but in a very real sense, it’s a whole of America approach. And I’ve already expressed, and I know you feel a great deal of gratitude to our partners in industry and in the airline industry for acting on your priority to put the safety and health of the American people first.
Donald Trump: (04:00)
Good, Mike. Thank you very much. I just want to add and to go a little bit further, the Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion. That was a decision we disagreed with. I don’t think we would’ve made it, but for some reason it was made. But we’ve undone that decision. Also, when people come in from certain areas we’re doing checks, not only at the site of takeoff, but at the side of landing. So when they land in our country, we’ll also do, that’s if the planes are leaving from certain destinations. I might ask doctor, if you could, I’d like you to say a few words. You’ve been doing a fantastic job in just a short time. We haven’t had much time, but you’ve really been doing a really fantastic time. Please.
Dr. Burks: (04:58)
Thank you. Well, before you came in, Mr. President, we talked about which Americans are most vulnerable and the fact that younger Americans may not be as vulnerable. So we’re really focused very much in that way and I think the airline industry can help us also in any kind of screening required, particularly to protect our older Americans.
Donald Trump: (05:19)
Good. Thank you. Thank you. Doug, do you have anything to say?
Doug: (05:23)
No. Thank you for having us. Thanks for the work we’re doing jointly to keep people safe. We’re proud of our team. We’re proud of the work they’re doing. We appreciate the aggressive containment efforts that the United States has done to protect Americans and the role we play in that. And so we’re happy to be here and continue to be interested in anything we can do as in particularly as we move from maybe aggressive containment to mitigation efforts, what could be done there as well.
Donald Trump: (05:54)
Doug is the head of American Airlines as you know. Maybe we’ll go around the room, if you’d like to say something, please.
Speaker 5: (06:00)
Well, thank you Mr. President. And again, we appreciate the leadership, appreciate the collaboration and coordination and certainly the industry wants to do everything that we can to keep Americans safe and certainly our employees and our customers. We’ve stepped up our efforts to make sure the airplanes are cleaned and disinfected and we work very closely with the CDC and I think that’s gone very, very well. So we’ve got the proper protocols in place whenever there is a suspected illness. And I think all that’s working very well where I think everybody’s doing a great job and doing all we can.
Donald Trump: (06:42)
We appreciate the job you’re doing. Thank you very much. Please.
Brad Tilden: (06:48)
Brad Tilden, Alaska Airlines. We appreciate the efforts, Mr. President. I think like all of the folks around the table, the focus of the airline leadership teams is the safety of our employees and the safety of our customers and that’s what we’re focused on. I think all of us have made a lot of changes to our cleaning procedures, changes to our onboard procedures, to gloves, sanitation, the service that our flight attendants are providing our customers and we’re trying to do everything we can to help everyone contain the virus and contain the spread of it. And we appreciate it. If there’s more that we can do to help, we’re here to tell you that we want to do that.
Donald Trump: (07:23)
Are you using different things for the cleaning, the fluids? Are you using different [crosstalk 00:07:28]?
Brad Tilden: (07:27)
We’ve taken a good look at them. The stuff that we’re using, I think we’ve concluded is effective, but we are changing the routines. There’s three levels of cleaning that we do and we’re intensifying the cleaning of the aircraft.
Donald Trump: (07:38)
Thank you very much. Great job. Peter.
Peter Ingram: (07:41)
Peter Ingram with Hawaiian Airlines. Mr. President, I echo my counterparts in the industry talking about the safety of our guests and our employees is paramount in everything we do and really appreciate the collaboration with the administration and the government to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to ensure that. I think it is very helpful to hear Dr. Burks talk about the specific areas of risk because there is a lot of concern out there. There’s concern internationally about travel and there’s concern domestically and I think the more information that we have to share with our guests about the facts is very helpful as we go forward with this challenge.
Donald Trump: (08:29)
Good. Thank you very much. Thanks, Peter.
Matt Koscal: (08:32)
Matt Koscal from Republic Airways. Thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity for us to come together as leaders in the aviation industry and to have a sharing of information, which I think is critical. We all represent the men and women that are on the front lines and need to ensure that they have the tools, resources, and information to do their job each and every day so these efforts are effective. And the one thing the aviation industry has proven it does very well is comes together in times of challenge to provide a solution for this country. So I feel very confident that with your leadership and all the folks in the room that we will continue to serve first and foremost our employees so they can serve the customers that depend on us.
Donald Trump: (09:15)
Chad, did you have anything to say about all that?
Chad: (09:17)
Well, I would just say, Mr. President, that again at your leadership, we’re funneling to 11 specific airports and contract medical staff that we put in place have screened over 53,000 individuals and prevented a number of folks from coming into the country. And that’s largely due to the cooperation and the flexibility of the individuals in this room. So again, thank you for everything that you’re doing to help us keep America safe.
Donald Trump: (09:38)
And Chad, anything different on the southern border where we’re doing so well? We’re setting records on the southern border in terms of allowing the people that are supposed to be here in but not allowing others in. Anything new on the southern border?
Chad: (09:50)
Well, again, from a screening standpoint, we have some of the same measures that we do at airports of entry at our land ports of entry. So we CVP officers and again contract medical staff, some from HHS and some contract are again screening individuals and then referring to CDC as necessary. So some of the same procedures at airports taking place at land ports of entry as well as maritime ports of entry. So for DHS we’re looking at every way individuals come into the country, not just through the airports, making sure that we’re securing the country as a whole.
Donald Trump: (10:19)
Good job. Thank you.
Speaker 10: (10:20)
Mr. President, thank you for having us. We were delighted when you made the vice president the head of the Interagency Task Force. We believe in collaboration. We want to try to solve these problems both short and longterm. We’ve been sharing ideas with the vice president’s staff and your staff. We think there are better ways to trace the passengers coming in. We’ve contracted to have a mobile app and a website developed that everyone would have to fill out that would go directly to CDC with that information. And we’re moving forward with that. So there’s been good progress. I think what we all need is the reassurance that you and the vice president and others have been providing the travel is safe and that we can go forward because right now the fear is almost worse than the virus.
Donald Trump: (11:02)
Yeah. And we’re we’re doing a good job. These professionals are really amazing, they’ve really stepped up like the airlines have stepped up very much so. Thank you.
Robin Hayes: (11:11)
Mr. President, Robin Hayes, JetBlue. Thank you very much for having us today, Mr. Vice President. A lot of it’s been said, but we’re taking many of the same measures as everyone else to keep our customers and our crew members, our employees safe and secure. Thank you for putting the vice president in charge of these efforts. The federal government has a tremendous capability when it comes together and is orchestrated with a common goal, and I’d just like to send just a quick shout out to the people in the federal government and the people that work for all of us who are really in the front lines of this and the heroic efforts they’re making every day to keep us safe and secure.
Donald Trump: (11:50)
Thank you very much. Oscar.
Oscar: (11:50)
Well, I’ll take a different angle just because a lot of it’s been said. I started my whole conversation earlier before you came in on the safety and health of our customers and our employees are the top one, so we will cooperate in collaborating with everything. I think as I look through this from a personal lens, I’m a heart transplant survivor. I am, if you think of the poster child for the individual that could be affected by this, I’m it. Older than the age and I have immune systems and so that’s the task we take at United about making our planes safe. We’re exploring all the different ideas and aspects that we can do to ensure that our planes are as safe as possible.
Oscar: (12:25)
From the ask perspective anything that continues to project stability, calm and Dr. Burks with regards to behavior, we’ve invented the corona bump at United where you’ll see us all bumping each other. It may sound silly, but it’s a fun way of expressing what I think we all need to know is be careful for the next few weeks as we control this that we adapt our behavior so that indeed we can continue to stay safe. So thank you for [crosstalk 00:12:52].
Donald Trump: (12:51)
That’s right. You are a heart transplant survivor. I was reading about that as one of the big executives, great executives of our country, of the world, and your heart transplant. I’ll tell you, you look very good to me, Oscar.
Oscar: (13:04)
I don’t recommend it.
Donald Trump: (13:04)
You have that one down. Don’t recommend it, but you, that’s fantastic story. Wow, that’s great. Thank you very much, Oscar. Mike, why don’t you finish it up?
Mike Pence: (13:12)
Well, thank you Mr. President. Again, the American people deserve to know that the threat of contracting the coronavirus remains low according to all our experts. But at your direction, we are going to continue to bring the full resources of the federal government and we’re going to enlist the full resources of American industry to keep the American people safe. And our airlines have been exceptional partners with us, not only the executives, but we also want to commend the crews that have been taking such good care of passengers, people that are cleaning the planes and keeping it all safe and working with us on the screening process and the funneling process. And as you said, Mr. President, we’re going to continue to lean into this effort and we will continue to do so until we find our way through the impacts of the coronavirus. And when we accomplish that, we’ll accomplish it as one American people, as one team. And I’m grateful to have the people on the team here in the room.
Donald Trump: (14:20)
Great job, Mike. As a certain areas get to be more of a problem, we may close them up as we have done with numerous areas. At this moment, we think we have it very much in hand. We’ve closed certain areas down very strongly. In some cases, not whole countries, but certain areas within countries like in Italy. We are I think doing a very effective job in terms of that. It’s very important.
Donald Trump: (14:47)
The one thing that we were discussing before is you really don’t know what the percentage of some people will have this at a very light level and won’t even go to a doctor or a hospital. They’ll get better. There are many people like that. Young people seem to be, you can’t say immune to it, but there’s certainly, the numbers are very small. And it does affect the older people that, like the nursing home situation that we have on the west coast, a single nursing home where we have a pretty big percentage of people. But as things go along, so we’re trying to adjust the number, we’re trying to see what the number might be, but if you add many, many people that have it and don’t know they have it or they think they have a cold and all of a sudden they’re recovering from it. I think that number will probably be a lot different numbers than the twos and even the one and a halves that we’re hearing. And I think that’s an important thing for people to know.
Donald Trump: (15:41)
I’m very proud of the people in the administration. I’m very proud of the airline business. You said it very well when you said the airline business always seems to pull together and I’ve seen that over the years and this is a great case of it. And I want to thank you all, you’re great executives and you love the country and you love what you do and thank you all very much. We appreciate it. Thank you.
Speaker 13: (16:00)
Mr. President, are you going to be giving any sort of financial support for the airlines to deal with that loss of business from overseas [inaudible 00:16:06]?
Donald Trump: (16:06)
Don’t ask that question please because they haven’t asked it. So I don’t want you to give them any ideas or you’ll end up heading an airline. He’ll end up heading an airline. That’s a pretty tough question. So I don’t. We haven’t discussed that yet.
Speaker 14: (16:20)
Is your message to Americans that it’s safe to fly and can you convince the traveling [crosstalk 00:16:27]?
Donald Trump: (16:27)
I think where these people are flying, it’s safe to fly. In large portions of the world are very safe to fly. So we don’t want to say anything other than that. And we have closed down certain sections of the world frankly. And they’ve sort of automatically closed them also. And if they’ll understand that and they understand it better perhaps than anybody. Yes, it’s safe.
Speaker 15: (16:47)
Are American businesses overreacting to cutting down domestic travel and they’re telling people not to fly to [inaudible 00:16:52] inside the United States?
Donald Trump: (16:53)
Well, a lot of people are doing a lot of domestic business now. I can tell you they’re staying in this country. They feel safe because we have a, if you look at a percentage, we have a very, very small percentage and a big percentage of what we have is when we brought in the 40 or so people from the ship. We brought them in, we immediately quarantined them.
Donald Trump: (17:11)
But you’re adding that to the numbers that we had, which were very small. Now what we’re going to do is as people get better, because most of these people are getting better. Some are already released, some are going home, some get a full 100% report. We’re going to take them off the list. But we have a very small number of people in this country. We have a big country. The biggest impact we had was when we took the 40 plus people, they’re Americans. I mean, I could say don’t let them into the country, but these are Americans and they were literally stranded and it was very unfair. We brought them back. We immediately quarantined them. But you add that to the numbers, but if you don’t add that to the numbers, we’re talking about very small numbers in the United States.
Donald Trump: (17:54)
We’ve all done a very good job, all of us. And I think the news has been in the, for the most part, the media has really treated us very fairly, which I appreciate. I think it’s very important.
Speaker 16: (18:04)
Mr. President, is there anything that they should be doing differently since you think it is safe to fly?
Donald Trump: (18:09)
Ask the head of American Airlines or United Airlines.
Speaker 16: (18:12)
Executives around the table that if you’re a passenger you’d get on that plane. We’ve been told, wash your hands.
Donald Trump: (18:17)
Maybe Dr. Burks, Dr. Burks, you can maybe say something.
Dr. Burks: (18:22)
Well, we’re always saying the common sense of washing your hands, not touching your face, ensuring that if you’ve touched anything, you go and wash your hands again, 20 seconds with soap. Hand sanitizers also work, but I think I was very reassured to hear the airlines talk about their cleaning procedures and there are three levels of cleaning procedures because I think that will be reassuring to the American public.
Donald Trump: (18:51)
And I haven’t touched my face in weeks and weeks. It’s been weeks. I miss it.
Speaker 17: (18:52)
Would you do anything to address some of the concerns of maybe travelers who booked their flights and they might be coming up on a trip and they might have to make rearrangements? Is that something…
Donald Trump: (19:02)
Doug, what would you say about that?
Doug: (19:05)
We’ve just issued, we put out a fair sale recently that allows customers the flexibility to book their travel in advance and if they find they want to change that later, the change fees are waived. So I think all of us were working to figure out ways to make sure that there’s flexibility for them.
Donald Trump: (19:20)
I would think, Oscar, how would you handle that? You have a lot of people they’ve booked and now made a-
Oscar: (19:26)
Listen, this is a time unprecedented in our history that we need to be absolutely understanding of people’s travel plans and like [inaudible 00:19:34] and most of the airlines, we are taking all appropriate measures to make sure that our customers get the best treatment.
Donald Trump: (19:41)
I think people are going to be very impressed with what the airlines do.
Speaker 18: (19:43)
Mr. President, you mentioned the Obama era rule that you had changed regarding this virus. I didn’t follow that.
Donald Trump: (19:50)
Well, let’s talk about it. Go ahead.
Mike Pence: (19:51)
We can talk. Bob Redfield, you might speak about the last administration asserted FDA jurisdiction over testing and the development of tests like this and Bob, the president changed that on Saturday. So that now as I spoke to several governors this morning, states now have the ability to actually conduct the coronavirus tests in state labs, university laboratories and that’s because of the change the president authorized. Bob, you just might very quick reflect on the changing jurisdiction of that that’s freed up more available testing.
Bob Redfield: (20:27)
Thank you, Mr. Vice President. So in the past we used to be able to have laboratories that could develop what we call laboratory developed tests and then be able to apply them for clinical purposes. And in the previous administration that became regulated so that now for someone to do that, they had to formally file with the FDA. And what the president’s decision did was allow that regulatory relief now and that those university labs and those other labs in this country now can be fully engaged in developing laboratory diagnostics for the clinical arena so the men and women this nation can get access to and the doctors to get to know the extent of HIV and the patients that they’re caring for. It’s really very, very important. It’s what’s changed the availability of testing overnight.
Donald Trump: (21:17)
This was a very big move and it was something that we had to do and we did it very quickly and now we have tremendous flexibility, many, many more sites, many, many more people. And you couldn’t have had that under the Obama rule and we ended that rule very quickly. Yes.
Speaker 19: (21:32)
Mr. President, on the contact tracing, can you explain what you’re hoping to get from these folks? What more information do they need to track or share with the government?
Donald Trump: (21:41)
Go ahead, Chad.
Chad: (21:42)
So what we’re asking for is additional pieces of information so that the CDC, HHS and others can track individuals as they come into the country and as they continue on to their final destination. And if we need to, from a health perspective, to continue to reach out, continue to track them and to get in touch with them, looking for a few more pieces of information and data from them.
Speaker 19: (22:03)
Do you think you’ll give us information in this meeting today on that?
Chad: (22:06)
I think we will continue to have conversations, but yes, we’ll get that for you.
Speaker 21: (22:09)
Can I follow up on that question? The North Carolina case was someone who was at the nursing home in Washington State, does the administration now have the contact information who were with that person on the flight to North Carolina?
Bob Redfield: (22:25)
That public health evaluation is ongoing right now and we’re working with the airlines and obviously within their North Carolina health department. CDC supports the local public health department to really work together to get all that information that’s in progress.
Speaker 21: (22:40)
But at this point you do not have that, the passenger information.
Bob Redfield: (22:45)
My understanding is we have the manifest. Now the trick is to go find them and that’s why we’re having this discussion.
Donald Trump: (22:50)
And much of that has been done already.
Speaker 22: (22:52)
All right. Thanks guys, let’s go.
Donald Trump: (22:57)
Thank you very much everybody.
Speaker 22: (22:58)
Thanks, guys.
Donald Trump: (22:58)
No questions on the election? This has to be [crosstalk 00:22:59].
Speaker 22: (22:59)
All right. Thanks, guys, let’s go. Let’s go. Come on, guys. [inaudible 00:23:07], let’s go.
Donald Trump: (23:11)
I think the election was a great last night. I thought it was great. I thought the results were, it was a great comeback for Joe Biden. Incredible comeback when you think about it. But if you would’ve looked, if Elizabeth Warren would have done what she probably should have done from their point of view, he would’ve won. Right? He would have won a lot of States including Massachusetts, probably Texas, definitely Minnesota. So Bernie would’ve won states that he lost I think it was fairly easily. But in particular, Massachusetts, I would say Minnesota in particular. I would also say Texas and some others. So had she, I put something out on it this morning. She was really a spoiler because other people got out in those votes in order to Joe. And those people really helped Joe by getting out early. But the couple that got out as the endorsement. In the case of Elizabeth Warren, had she gotten out, it would’ve been a very different situation I think.
Donald Trump: (24:16)
It would have been a very different night. Just that one simple move. Had she left, you pick up Massachusetts, Minnesota and probably Texas and those are the three I check. I would imagine there are others that he would’ve picked up, too. So Elizabeth Warren was the single biggest factor in that election last night. It would have been a very different thing and not in a positive way for her, in a very selfish way for her. She was very selfish from that point of view. Now do I care? No, because we’re just waiting to find out who we’re running against. But when you look at it, pretty incredible. If she would’ve gotten out and endorsed, even if she didn’t, she didn’t even have to endorse. I think there’s a lot of bad blood there, but had she gotten out and endorsed, he would’ve been a lot better off.
Speaker 23: (25:06)
What do you think happens now?
Donald Trump: (25:08)
Well now I think it’s a very tough, I think it’s tough. I think Joe has an easier path right now, believe it or not. I see Mini Mike just got out and he’s going to try and save face by putting some money into Biden’s campaign and we’ll see what happens. I don’t think that’s going to have an impact. You got to look, money has to be spent wisely. One thing this whole thing has shown that you can’t buy an election. It’s a beautiful thing. Steyer put in $250, $300 million and now who knows where he is? He’s home probably licking his wounds. And Bloomberg put in probably $1 billion and sometimes you just don’t have what it takes. And I said to him, “It’s not easy doing what I did, is it?” So it’s one of those things, but it’s going to be very interesting to think that this would have changed so much because if you go before Saturday, before South Carolina, I mean, Joe had absolutely no chance according to you people.
Donald Trump: (26:13)
But they used to say that about me, too. Not as much though. I think I always felt that I had a very good chance. But I’d watch and they’d say, “Well, it can’t happen.” But it happened and it happened pretty easily. I think Joe actually would have the advantage now. If you look at the states he’s going to with Florida and others, I think he’s got an advantage in those states. But again, had Elizabeth Warren endorsed Bernie, you’re talking about a whole different subject and that’s not even a question. You’re talking about a whole… because he would’ve gotten 80, 90 almost. I mean, he would’ve gotten most of those votes. So you’re talking about a much different…
Speaker 24: (26:49)
What do you think of the stock market’s reaction today? It seems like there’s been a sigh of relief that [crosstalk 00:26:53].
Donald Trump: (26:52)
I think, well, I’ve said from the beginning, it’s partially this, it’s a big part of this, but it’s also the fact that they didn’t like seeing what they’re seeing. But they don’t like Joe either. Joe’s become, a lot of people are with Joe. If you look at those people, they’re worse than Bernie in terms of being radical left. I mean, some of Joe’s handlers and that’s what they are is handlers. I want to be nice, but they are handlers. Some of Joe’s handlers are further left than Bernie. That’s pretty scary. So it’s going to be that way.
Speaker 25: (27:28)
Do you think Bloomberg’s money will be more powerful without Bloomberg himself in the race? He said he’s-
Donald Trump: (27:32)
Well, it couldn’t be less powerful because look what $1 billion did. He won nothing. I mean he got so few delegates. It’s incredible. I would say probably, well, now he’s doing that because he’s spiteful and he’s a spiteful guy. I know him well, he’s a very spiteful guy, he’s very upset. He made a fool out of himself to be honest with you. And he’s not too happy about that. I think the first thing he should do is fire his political consultants because I could have told, I know, I could have told him very easily, you can’t win. You can put $2 billion in, you can’t win. Okay. Thank you, everybody.
Speaker 22: (28:07)
Come on, let’s go. Come on, let’s go."
"Mar 3, 2020",9:11 A.M. EST,"Tony Fauci: (00:00)
[silence 00:00:00] Mr. President, thank you very much for coming to the NIH today. We really are very pleased-
Donald Trump: (00:16)
Thank you. Thank you, Tony.
Tony Fauci: (00:16)
We really are very, very pleased with your visit, and I want to just, again, thank you for your support of everything that we’ve been doing in this obviously very important problem. What I’ve asked is just first to have Francis Collins, our director-
Donald Trump: (00:30)
Good.
Tony Fauci: (00:30)
Just make a couple of comments about the NIH in general, and then I’ll talk to you about some of the things that you and I have been talking about for the past few weeks.
Donald Trump: (00:37)
Good. Thank you.
Francis Collins: (00:39)
Well, Mr. President welcome to NIH. It’s wonderful to have you here.
Donald Trump: (00:41)
Thank you, Francis.
Francis Collins: (00:42)
Even though we are in fact faced with a very serious public health situation, we have a lot of people here that are working hard on it and are honored by your presence.
Donald Trump: (00:50)
Thank you.
Francis Collins: (00:50)
And honored also by the presence of the secretary, my boss, and a wonderful boss he is indeed. Maybe I’ll just quickly say who else at the table so you understand who we’re with here. Starting over here. Dr. Barney Graham, who is the deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center, and that’s where we are right now. Next to him, Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett who is the frontline on the bench making this coronavirus vaccine happen.
Donald Trump: (01:15)
Good.
Francis Collins: (01:15)
So a wonderfully talented young scientist in our midst. You know Dr. Fauci of course. Next to him, Dr. John Mascola-
Donald Trump: (01:23)
Hi, John.
Francis Collins: (01:24)
Who’s the director of the Vaccine Research Center. And next to him, Dr. Larry Tabak who’s the principal deputy director of NIH.
Donald Trump: (01:30)
Good.
Francis Collins: (01:31)
And we are all thrilled to have you here. I just wanted to say a word about NIH because we haven’t had the privilege of having you with us before. And just to sort of set the context for this remarkable institution, supported by your administration, the largest supporter of biomedical research in the world, the National Institutes of Health.
Francis Collins: (01:48)
We distribute most of our funds, more than 80%, to institutions all over the country, so when you hear about a breakthrough in medical research that happened at the University of Illinois or Florida, it was probably supported by NIH. And we use the most rigorous peer review system in the world to decide what we’re going to fund. And we do everything from fundamental discovery to clinical trials, and everything in between. You could say we do Alzheimer’s to Zika, or A to Z, or some version of that. And we also support infrastructure that makes it possible, at a time like this, to be able to move rapidly in terms of developing a vaccine, and you’ll hear more about that from Dr. Fauci.
Francis Collins: (02:25)
The consequences of NIH research, you could measure in various ways. Extension in longevity, reduction in deaths from heart attack down 70% from what they used to be, strokes likewise. Cancer rates of death dropping about one or 2% a year. HIV, which used to be a death sentence now compatibles long survival. Cystic fibrosis, a disease it used to be, maybe get kids to live for eight or 10 years. Now, just in the last few months, announcement of a drug therapy. That means a lot of those individuals are planning for retirement. What a big change it has been.
Francis Collins: (02:58)
Economics. I think we could also say this is one of the government’s best investments, because the return on investment, every dollar that NIH spends is about $8.38, because of all of the other economic activity that that inspires.
Francis Collins: (03:12)
But a major component of NIH, though it’s only about 11% of the budget, is the intramural program, that’s where you are now on this campus. More than 5000 MDs, PhDs, and MD PhDs work here on a wide variety of things. A few hundred yards from here, the largest research hospital in the world, the NIH Clinical Center. Among their achievements, the first chemotherapy for leukemia, the development of AZT for HIV, cancer immunotherapy now saving lives including people who thought that there was no hope for them, and are now being not just helped but cured. Dramatic advances in treating depression, lithium was invented here. Ketamine now turning to be a really exciting development for people with resistant depression. The first gene therapy for humans done here at NIH. And now evolving to a point where we are curing on this campus, people with sickle cell disease with gene therapy. And of course vaccines. Vaccines developed here for childhood meningitis, for HPV, for Ebola, and now we’re going to talk about coronavirus.
Francis Collins: (04:16)
So, for all these reasons, people call us the National Institutes of Hope, and we’re happy to embrace that particular description. And you have next to you the, probably, most highly regarded infectious disease expert in the country. I might even say in the world. Dr. Tony Fauci. And we have been graced by his presence for many decades, and he is exactly the right person to tell you what we’re doing right now about coronavirus, and how we’re going to address the need for a vaccine in order to tackle this really difficult problem.
Francis Collins: (04:47)
So, thank you for being here. I hope that’s helped us.
Donald Trump: (04:49)
Thank you Francis. Thank you very much.
Tony Fauci: (04:50)
Okay. Again, thanks again. I just want to connect what we’ve been talking about over the past few weeks. So, if I could just get the… See this slide here, remember when I mentioned that the fastest from the time that you get a pathogen, you know what it is, to the time you do a phase one trial for safety. So, look at what’s happened when SARS was in 2003, from the time we got the virus to the time we did the first phase one trial. Remember that doesn’t mean you have a vaccine, it means for safety. It was 20 months. Then H5N1 Influenza, we got it down to 11. H1N1 Influenza 4. Zika, 3.25. And now, we believe, as I’ve told you several times, it’s two to three months, I think it’s going to be two. So that kind of thing is what this place is all about. It’s kind of like the SWAT team, of going out and responding to emerging microbes.
Tony Fauci: (05:52)
So, this building, this entire center was first started in response to making a vaccine for HIV, but the crew that we brought together, and we brought the best of the best from all over the country. Dr. John Mascola is the director of this place. We do everything from fundamental basic science to the clinical trials. We would, and I say this with some pride, but also with some modesty, is that there’s a lot of questions and things that we need to do, but this group is so good at what they do, that every time we have a challenge and that challenge could be flu, that challenge can be Ebola, that challenge could be anything. We always turn to this team to do that, and it’s really something that we feel that we’re proud of, but I think the nation should know that these are the kind of things that we have available for them. John, you want to?
John Mascola: (06:51)
I would just like to also welcome you Mr. President, Mr. Secretary, to our vaccine research center. We look forward to a brief tour for you upstairs where you can have Dr. Corbett, and Dr. Green tell you about how we’re working on the coronavirus vaccine.
Donald Trump: (07:05)
Good.
Tony Fauci: (07:06)
Just to give you a comparison, because we always talk about SARS, and we always talk about MERS, and things like that. If we could have, just go through the slide. I just want to go to the next slide. This is an article that I wrote a little while ago, and I called it Coronavirus infections – More Than the Common Cold. The reason is, up until recently, coronaviruses were mild things. They were just common cold, and they just… Next slide. In fact, those are all different kinds of viruses. The ones with with the red circle around them are the four viruses that cause the common cold. That was until 2002. Then we got a big surprise, and the surprise was, next, is that we had the severe acute respiratory syndrome and that was SARS. Multiple years later we got the Middle East respiratory syndrome.
Tony Fauci: (08:03)
But a story that you may remember. Next slide. In China, in the Guangdong Province, history repeats itself. Mr President. In China in the Guangdong Province, there was this strange disease that came up that nobody knew what it was. The Chinese didn’t really tell anybody about it for a few months. November until it got to Hong Kong. When it got to Hong Kong. Next slide. In a hotel in Hong Kong, this was way back in 2003, someone from China went to the hotel, infected a bunch of people. Next slide. And this is what you had. You had flights going. At the time, we didn’t make any restrictions the way you did, which I think saved us a really a lot of hurt. Next slide. And then this is what happened. There were 8000 cases, 774 deaths, and that’s how I get the number that I’ve been telling you, that the mortality of SARS was about nine to 10%. If you do that math, that’s what it is.
Tony Fauci: (09:02)
Right. Next slide. The other one is the MERS coronavirus, which was the one that was in Saudi Arabia. That was also from an animal reservoir. Next. In fact, it was from a bat. Next. From a bat, to a camel. And then for the people in the Middle East who got it, that was the infection there. So these are the kinds of things that go from an animal reservoir to a human. Sometimes it doesn’t go anywhere, it just goes one or two people. But sometimes it adapts itself to function very, very, very efficiently. Next. And that’s what happened. We had MERS coronavirus in Saudi Arabia. We had a few cases in the United States, but not many. And finally. Next. This is where we are right now, with the coronavirus. And then just getting back to the last, we got this sequence about a week after the Chinese were able to put it up on the board. And next. And then these are the things that we do. Therapeutics, vaccines. So we’ll stop there, but we’d really like to hear some comments from you, Mr. President. You want to?
Donald Trump: (10:07)
Well, I want to thank you all. This is incredible, and I’ve heard about you, and I know all of you by name, and now I get to meet you. Unfortunately, I get to meet you because we’re talking about this. But we’ve made tremendous progress. I know you’re dealing with other nations to help them out, because they got hit some of them very badly, and we’re talking to them also. And we’re making decisions as to whether or not we’re allowed to travel, they’re allowed to travel. We’ve been pretty severe on those restrictions, but I guess we did the right thing by being severe.
Donald Trump: (10:38)
NIH is the home of, I mean I see so many different factors, and it’s true the greatest doctors, I’ve heard that for so long. I heard that from my uncle, Dr. John Trump. He a big fan of what you’ve done, and how it started and it’s really been an incredible situation. But the scientists and researchers all over the world, they say this is the best there is, and I think the world is extremely happy that you’re involved. And, Tony, your reputation is second to none. I think we all agree with that. You have to agree with that, John, right? I mean you have no choice.
John Mascola: (11:13)
Indeed, sir.
Donald Trump: (11:14)
But the fact is that it is, in this case it’s true, and we’re very lucky to have you. I will say that the Vice President is over in the Hill, he’s just leaving now, and I told him to stay there and finish it up. But we’re doing very well in terms of getting the funding we need, the necessary funding. And I asked for X and they want to give us more than X and that’s okay, as far as I’m concerned. In this case, Francis, that’s unusual, but that’s okay. But I just want to thank everybody at NIH, and all of the great scientists and doctors, and everything. I know you’re working around the clock. I know you’ve made some great finds already, and that really makes us feel very good.
Donald Trump: (11:53)
We had some good meetings yesterday with the companies that, I guess you ultimately would go to the companies, you’d have to go to the companies. So we had Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, and some of the other great companies, and they were very positive as to the outcome. And therapeutics were a very big thing, because I guess therapeutics could happen faster than the actual vaccine, and certainly the result can happen a lot faster. So we’re looking for some good answers, but I just want to thank you very much Tony, and we really appreciate it. And John, thank you. Thank you very much. Fantastic job. Thank you very much. And you don’t have to shake hands. I see him everyday, so I don’t have to bother. So thank you all very much. Great job. Appreciate it.
Speaker 9: (12:40)
Mr. President, would travel to Japan or Italy right now.
Donald Trump: (12:45)
Well, I haven’t been asked to, but I think we’re making decisions on certain parts of those countries, as you know. We’ve already made a decision on parts of Italy, and Japan, it’s very unfortunate because I’ve seen the incredible job they did on the Olympics. As you know, they’re building a facility. It’s really finished. It’s beautiful. It’s finished right on time, as usual with the Japanese, the Prime Minister, very good friend of mine, Prime Minister Abe. And so I don’t know what they’re going to do. They have this magnificent facility and I don’t know what they’re going to do, but they’ll make the right decision, I know that. But yes, if it was necessary I would do it. Yes.
Speaker 10: (13:29)
What’s your timeline on further travel restrictions, Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (13:32)
Well we’re looking at different areas and we’ll make that decision with these professionals. We made an early decision based on a little bit of luck I suspect, but that was the original decision, on China itself. And China, and no offense to them, they never blamed us. It was a tough decision for them, but they fully understood. They were very reasonable about it, but that was a hard decision to make, but I guess we would’ve had a lot more people with difficulty if we didn’t make that decision very early on. But we’ll be making additional decisions as they arise, I guess, Tony.
Speaker 10: (14:08)
What about closing the southern borders? That’s still on the table?
Donald Trump: (14:11)
We’re not looking at it very strongly, we’re not seeing a lot of evidence in that area. We’re closing it, I guess, automatically because we have a very strong border there now. We didn’t have a strong border at all. We’ve built a 129 miles of wall, and the wall areas a hundred percent secure, but we haven’t seen any great, I don’t think we’ve seen any great evidence that that area is a problem at this moment. So we won’t have to bother with that, at this moment.
Donald Trump: (14:40)
Any body? You’re so nice today, I can’t believe it.
Tony Fauci: (14:43)
This is the NIH, that’s it.
Donald Trump: (14:45)
It’s NIH, it rubbed off.
Speaker 11: (14:47)
Super Tuesday?
Donald Trump: (14:50)
Say it?
Speaker 11: (14:50)
Tell us about Super Tuesday. How you’re watching the primary taking place?
Donald Trump: (14:54)
Well, it’s going to be a very interesting evening of television. I think it’s really going to be something. I’ve got some races going on that didn’t seem to exist a few days ago, and now Biden does come up a little bit, and I don’t know what’s happened with Bernie. I think they’re trying to take it away from him. I don’t know if that’s fair, but I guess it’s politics when you get right down to it. What’s fair? But I think it’s going to be a very interesting evening of television, and because of the time difference, California time difference, it’s going to go a little bit later than we’re accustomed to. Right?
Speaker 11: (15:26)
Who would you like to [crosstalk 00:15:27]?
Donald Trump: (15:26)
And I will be watching. Who would I like to win? Anybody. I’ll take anybody I have to. That’s the way it’s got to work. Doesn’t matter.
Speaker 11: (15:35)
Have a favorite opponent?
Donald Trump: (15:36)
I really just, we’ve done a great job. We have the strongest economy on earth. We’ve gone up, and as you know, China’s economy has been hurt very badly long before this. We’ve done a really good job, and I think people understand that, and I’m looking at polls that are very good, but you know, whoever it is it is. We’ll take them on. We have no choice, right? Anything else?
Speaker 12: (15:59)
Did you have a reaction to the North Korean launch of those missiles yesterday?
Donald Trump: (16:04)
No, I have no reaction. Short term missiles? No. No.
Speaker 12: (16:08)
And then on the Afghanistan, was that your first conversation with the leader of the Taliban?
Donald Trump: (16:13)
I don’t want to say that, but we had a very good conversation with the leader of the Taliban today, and they’re looking to get this ended, and we’re looking to get it ended. I think we all have a very common interest, we’ll find out about the country itself, but the country really has to get it ended. We’ve been there for 20 years. Other presidents have tried, and they have been unable to get any kind of an agreement. The relationship is very good that I have with Mullah, and we had a good long conversation today and they want to cease the violence. They’d like to see cease violence also.
Speaker 12: (16:51)
The Afghan government seems reluctant to turn over those 5000 prisoners.
Donald Trump: (16:55)
Well, they may be reluctant they’ve done very well with the United States for many years, far beyond military. If you look at all the money that we’ve spent in Afghanistan, we’ve spent trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars, and we’re really a police force. We’re really not fighting per se. It’s a fight that if we had to, we’d win, but I don’t want to kill millions of people. We would win it fairly quickly, but I don’t want to kill millions of people. I think it’s crazy. And so we’ve been there, will be very, very soon it’ll be 20 years. And I said right from the beginning, not easy to get out of these conflicts. Very complex in terms of all of the people you have to deal with. Including, frankly, people in the Senate, people in the House, and a lot of people feel differently about things. But I’ve been amazed at how positive the response is to getting out of Afghanistan, and to moving on. And I really had a great conversation with him today, yes.
Speaker 12: (17:58)
The meet the meeting today- [crosstalk 00:18:00].
Speaker 13: (18:00)
Considering new guidelines for nursing homes, given the cluster in Washington state?
Speaker 10: (18:05)
I’ll ask you to answer that question.
Tony Fauci: (18:06)
Do you want Mr. Secretary?
Alex Azar: (18:09)
So actually we have been educating healthcare providers really from day one back in January about the need to be on guard against respiratory syndrome. And then, when we had this case of the longterm care facility in Washington, we sent out special alerts to longterm care facilities to be very mindful about infection control, isolation, with these most vulnerable of our seniors, and other individuals who have comorbid conditions. And that’s really what we’ve been seeing around the world, is the prevalence of fatalities have been in the elderly and those who have other forms of medical fragility, comorbid conditions. And so really being on very high alert in our nursing home community is called for.
Speaker 12: (18:52)
Mr. Secretary, could you talk about your meeting with lawmakers today, and what specifically they’re asking of the federal government? What’s their biggest concern?
Alex Azar: (19:01)
Well, I think it’s the same concern that we’ve all had, which is getting testing out there rapidly into the community so that we can be testing as many people as possible. As you know, our excellent teams down at the CDC developed the test really in record time within weeks of getting the genetic sequence back in January, and we approved the diagnostic at the FDA under an emergency use authorization in record time. We’ve been able to be testing at CDC throughout without any backlog and testing, our throughput has been great there. We’ve had 12 labs qualified to be able to do the testing. We did suffer a manufacturing issue on that test as it went out to the rest of the public health labs. We’ve gotten that issue solved in the last week, so that’s up and running in the public health labs. We also have gotten this test produced by this contractor to get it out, so we will, this week, have up to seventy five thousand tests shipping out there to public health labs, as well as available to hospitals for ordering.
Alex Azar: (20:03)
And then something really important happened on Saturday morning. So one of the biggest issues around testing that people don’t understand, is during the Obama administration, the FDA for the first time, asserted control and regulatory jurisdiction over what are called lab developed tests. Before that, if a hospital or a lab like a quest diagnostics, a lab corp, or an academic medical center would develop a test on their own with reagents and tests, they could just do that if they were a certified clinical lab called a CLIA lab. But under the Obama administration, the FDA asserted jurisdiction and said, you have to come to us first, and get approval of that test before you can do it. On Saturday morning, Commissioner Hahn issued guidance saying under an emergency use authorization, we are permitting these labs, these public health labs, these hospital labs, commercial labs, to go ahead, get the test going, do your own test, make it available, and come to us for approval after the fact under emergency use authorization. That will make, this Commissioner Hahn has said, millions of tests per week available quite rapidly.
Speaker 15: (21:15)
Mr. Secretary, can I ask you about this study from the CDC today that showed the Americans most at risk of contracting coronavirus, are people living with patients. So should Americans be less worried about catching the virus from say people on the street or people on an airport?
Alex Azar: (21:31)
So what we said at the press conference just yesterday is very consistent with that, which is for the average American, in your daily life, the risk of getting the novel coronavirus is very low, but if you are around individuals who have the novel coronavirus, the risk obviously is higher and that’s why the efforts we’re taking with the state of Washington, and with Santa Clara County, and elsewhere in the country are around what’s called community mitigation. Which is to isolate individuals who have the disease, as well as to reduce social contact to bring the level of disease spreading down.
Speaker 15: (22:06)
Mr. President, I don’t know if you had seen reports about the Vice President having shaken hands with students from a Florida school, one of whom had been placed in a voluntary self quarantine. Does that concern you at all? What did you think about that?
Donald Trump: (22:20)
I haven’t seen that report, no. I haven’t seen it.
Speaker 9: (22:23)
Mr. President, how much money should go to hospitals for the uninsured?
Donald Trump: (22:27)
Well, we’re going to look at the uninsured, because they have a big problem and we’re going to look at the uninsured people that… This came as a surprise to all of us. Just happened to chose what could happen in life, but we’re going to be looking at the uninsured, see if we can help them out.
Alex Azar: (22:40)
We’re working, as part of the emergency supplemental, we’ll work with Congress on programs to help hospitals as they care for the uninsured with novel coronavirus.
Donald Trump: (22:50)
Okay, thank you all very much. [crosstalk 00:22:52].
Tony Fauci: (22:51)
We’re going to take you upstairs now, okay?
Donald Trump: (22:54)
Okay.
Tony Fauci: (22:58)
And we’re going to have Kizzmekia tell you a little bit about what she’s doing. [crosstalk 00:23:01]"
"Mar 2, 2020",Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY): “I was proud to attend President Trump’s State of the Union address and hear him discuss the crucial work we’re doing together for the American people.”,"Donald Trump: (02:45)
I want to thank you very much. North Carolina, thank you very much. I’m thrilled to back in the great city of Charlotte, where, by the way, we’re having our convention. I guess you heard that, right? With thousands of hardworking American patriots who love our country, cherish our values, respect our laws and always put America first. Eight months from now, we’re going to defeat the radical socialists. We’re going to win the great state of North Carolina in a landslide. We won it last time, we’re going to win it this time by even more. And you know, Eric and Lara named their daughter, you know what her name is? Carolina, Carolina. Her name is Carolina for a reason.
Donald Trump: (03:39)
This is an incredible time for our nation. Our country is stronger than ever before. And today, we just had the largest one day increase in the stock market in history. That’s great. That’s great. That was great. You know, our opponents were saying, ” Oh, maybe he’s in trouble, maybe the economy … ” They’ll do anything. They’ll do anything. I’m sure they were thrilled. Do you think our opponents were thrilled when they saw the stock market today? I don’t think so.
Donald Trump: (04:19)
By the way, look at this. Look back there, look at all of that press. Look at all them. Man, I don’t know if Sleepy Joe, or Bernie, I don’t think they have that much press. Bernie was going wild. Why would I be here tonight? Why would I be here? He said why would I be here tonight? We don’t have the primary, we’ve already won the thing, you know? I was going to say the you know what thing, I held it back, because they’ll say, “Horrible language. He used horrible language today.” But we’re doing fantastically.
Donald Trump: (04:59)
There’s never been a time where the Republican Party was so unified as it is now. Never, never. And you hear about enthusiasm for crazy Bernie, and that’s true, he does have some enthusiasm, but much less than we have and a much smaller group of people, too. And there’s not a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. I thought he gave up the presidency the other day because he said he’s running for the Senate. I looked at the First Lady, I said, ” Hey, he’s running for the Senate.” And today he just said Super Thursday, he’s looking forward to Super Thursday.
Donald Trump: (05:53)
Jobs are booming in our country, incomes are soaring, poverty has plummeted, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of a thing called the United States military. Every day, for me and for you, it’s promises made, promises kept. One of the most important promises I made is right to this era. You know, we look at it, it’s the never ending wars in the Middle East. We’re taking our soldiers, we’re bringing them back home. We’re not law enforcement. We’re bringing them back home. American troops cannot be the policemen for the world, or to create democracy in other nations that frankly probably don’t want it. The job of the American military is to secure and defend our country.
Donald Trump: (07:04)
Two days ago, the Unites States signed a deal with the Taliban so that after 19 years of conflict, and very close to 20, we can finally begin to bring our amazing troops back home. After years of rebuilding foreign nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation and taking care of our own American citizens
Donald Trump: (07:35)
And all of the things that we’ve done, we’ve wiped out the terrorists, we’ve done so much, and you know what? We’re 8,000 miles away. You got a lot of big countries surrounding Afghanistan, you’ve got Afghanistan itself. The progress that was made, was made possible by the extraordinary valor of our men and our women in uniform. You know that. We pay a special tribute, and I know you pay it, a special tribute to our great wounded warriors and those who made the ultimate sacrifice.
Donald Trump: (08:27)
As we bring back our troops, we are committed to ensuring that foreign terrorists are denied admission to America in the first place. They’re not coming here, and if they do, bad things happen to them. We must keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country.
Donald Trump: (08:42)
By the way, I have to say this, you know you have thousands and thousands of people outside. Somebody was saying that if Pocahontas, any one of them, Sleepy Joe, he doesn’t have that, so he doesn’t have a lot, he has very small crowds, but if Sleepy Joe or if any of them had a crowd one-tenth this size, they go around talking about how big the crowd. They never say that. Hey, take your cameras and spin them around this big arena. Right now. Spin them around.
Donald Trump: (10:26)
They don’t turn, they don’t turn. You notice, they don’t turn. But if there were some kind of trouble in a little corner, anything to make us look bad, that camera would turn like a pretzel. I used to think, you know, modern equipment it can’t turn, but when we would have a protestor, and I must say, I’ll say it out loud, we don’t have too many protesters anymore, do we? [inaudible 00:10:48]. No fun to be a protestor at a Trump rally, but do we have a great time at a Trump rally?
Donald Trump: (10:55)
My administration has also taken the most aggressive action in modern history to protect Americans from the Coronavirus. You know about this whole thing? Horrible. Including, sweeping travel restrictions. Today, we met with the big great pharmaceutical companies, and they’re really working hard, and they’re working smart, and we had a great meeting today with a lot of the great companies. They’re going to have vaccines I think relatively soon. And they’re going to have something that makes you better, and that’s going to actually take place we think even sooner.
Donald Trump: (11:43)
So a lot of good things are happening, but we have strong borders, and really, our tough and early actions have really been proven to be 100% right. We went out, we’re doing everything in our power to keep the sick and infected people from coming into our country. We’re working on that very hard. We closed our borders very early. I took a lot of heat for that. Remember when I closed the borders to certain areas of the world? I took a lot of heat. But there are fringe globalists who would rather keep our borders open than keep our infection, think of it, keep all of the infection, let it come in. And we’re working with other countries. In all fairness, look, it’s a problem, we’re working with other countries. Remember this, over the last long period of time, the flu, the common flu, you know this, right? From 27,000 to 70,000 people get infected, and many people die. Think of it, 27,000. You lose 27,000 people to the common flu. It can be much more. One year was much higher than the 70,000 number. Those people died. So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn’t know that. Three, four weeks ago, I was sitting there, I said, “What do we lose with the regular flu?” They said, “About 27,000 minimum, goes up to 70, sometimes even 80, one year it went up to 100,000 people.” I said, “Nobody told me that. Nobody knows that.”
Donald Trump: (13:17)
So I actually told the pharmaceutical companies, “You have to do a little bit better job on that vaccine. Really, have to do a better job on that vaccine.” [inaudible 00:13:28]. Last year was approximately 36,000 people died. So we’re working hard on it, and we’re going to come up with some really great solutions. In the meantime, we’re stopping … Only in North Carolina. Only in North Carolina. It can only be. How many people here are from South Carolina, by the way? All right, we love both places. But that was from North Carolina.
Donald Trump: (14:17)
But just to finish up, so we’ve made a lot of progress, we’ve really done a great job with it. We’re keeping our borders strong. My job is to protect the health of American patients and Americans first, and that’s what I’ll do. Washington Democrats are trying to politicize the coronavirus, denigrating the noble work of our public health professionals. But honestly, not so much anymore. Everyone appreciates, these are the greatest professionals in the world at what they do. We’re actually helping a lot of other countries where they have some very, very big problems. So we have our professionals in constant touch, I’m in constant touch with some of the leaders and helping them out. But the political attacks from some of the Democrats really must stop. We’ve got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. We’re going to safeguard our people, the United States.
Donald Trump: (15:08)
The United States is, right now, ranked by far number one in the world for preparedness. Earlier today, when I met with the pharmaceutical companies, things were discussed and learned honestly. The media didn’t know. Nobody knew. They’ve never heard this before. And we learned a lot, and maybe that had the impact on the stock market. Who knows what happened, but we’re going to reduce and the severity of what’s happening, the duration of the virus. We discussed all of these things. We will bring these therapies to market as rapidly as possible.
Donald Trump: (15:56)
And I have to say, with a thriving economy the way it is, and the most advanced health system on earth, America is so resilient, we know what we’re doing, we have the greatest people on earth, the greatest health system on earth. We have the greatest health system on earth. The renewal of American strength over the last three years means at times of challenge, we are the best prepared to rise to any occasion. No country is better equipped than America to handle new threats, and no people are more skilled, talented, tough, or driven than Americans.
Donald Trump: (16:44)
And together, we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That’s what it is. Last month, we added 225,000 new jobs in January alone. That makes seven million jobs since the election. We have destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate, and we killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He is dead. And we took out the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign on terror forever, Soleimani.
Donald Trump: (17:32)
While the extreme left has been wasting time with vile hoaxes and delusional witch hunts, we have been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, and lifting up American citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed.
Donald Trump: (17:49)
Tomorrow, voters in states across the nation will head to the polls for Super Tuesday, not Super Thursday. No, he said, “Super Thursday.” You can’t do these things. Can you imagine if I said Super Thursday? It would be over, right? I would be over. No matter how good you are at certain things, you can’t, as an example, a name like Sleepy Joe, he’s constantly naming the wrong state. “It’s great to be in the state of Ohio.” No, no, no, I’m sorry, you’re in North Carolina. No, no. Joe! Do you ever see them run up with a sign, “No, no, North Carolina, Joe!” Once that happens, you might as well leave the states, because it’s a disaster no matter how good you’re doing. We’re in North Carolina! It’s great to be in Idaho! No, you’re in Iowa. Nah, he makes a lot of those mistakes, they’re a little scary.
Donald Trump: (18:53)
Did you see [inaudible 00:18:54]? We’re going to protect your second amendment, you understand that. But did you see, Sleepy Joe, did you see Sleepy Joe, where he said, “Last year, 150 million people were killed by guns in our country.” 150 million! That means 50% of our country. That’s a big story. 150. Can you imagine Trump saying that? These people would never let me live it down. We can’t make even a little mistake. We can’t make even a little, tiny, tiny mistake. If we make a tiny mistake, it’s headlining. They say things like 150 million people killed, guns, they say Super Thursday, they say Georgia, he’s looking forward to winning Georgia tomorrow. Georgia’s not in Super Tuesday!
Donald Trump: (20:00)
So many mistakes! You can’t do that when you’re negotiating with China. Can’t do that when you’re negotiating with these countries, can you? Those mistakes would be very tremendous.
Donald Trump: (20:22)
Then you have Mini Mike. You see this guy? Can you believe it? Mini Mike. He’s being interviewed tonight on Fox. Can you believe it? Fox. They want to be politically correct. They want to interview, they end up interviewing more Democrats than Republic … I don’t know what’s going on with Fox. But they’re interviewing this guy the night before … Mini Mike, ay, ay, ay, what a mess he is. The worst debate performance in the history of presidential debate history. The worst in history.
Donald Trump: (20:42)
Nah, I got to have more. I’d get down real low, but I don’t want to copy him. Everybody saw it. Everyone said, “Oh,” they all say, “Oh! Do that again where you get down low.” But if I do that again, it’s a copy. It’s a copy! No, no. No. You never like to copy, even though you’re copying yourself. You don’t like to copy. You do it once. It was a big hit. But you do it once, and you sort of say, “That was nice, don’t do it again,” because if it doesn’t work the second time, it gets embarrassing, right? Right? We all know. But no, he’s a disaster waiting to happen. He’s a mess.
Donald Trump: (21:37)
No matter which Democrat candidate you’re talking about, and you understand that, any one of these candidates … And you see what’s happening, right? It’s being rigged against … It’s sad. It’s being rigged against Crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie is going to go crazy. Crazy. I think Crazy Bernie is going to be more crazy when they see what they’re doing. I called it a long time ago. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Buttigieg, May Pete, he quit. Out last night. Then I hear a Senator from a state we’re going to win, we’re going to win that state, but she dropped out. Sounds like they made a deal. They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo, that’s why. Don’t care. Quid pro quo. Quid pro quo, they made a deal. Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo.
Donald Trump: (22:57)
But they’ve embraced an extreme left wing agenda. Their plans would massively raise your taxes, destroy our liberty, muzzle our faith, and erase our sovereignty. You know that. The Democrat Party has gone crazy. Whether it’s Bernie Sanders plan to eliminate private healthcare, Elizabeth Pocahontas’s plan … By the way, she’s history. She’s history. I came up with that name far too early, I should’ve just waited. But it didn’t matter. I thought she was making a come back. I said, “Wow, I just did it to her.”
Donald Trump: (23:31)
But you know those embers were burning a little bit a couple of months ago? They never caught on. In fact, she’ll probably lose the State of Massachusetts to Bernie. So she doesn’t know what to do because you’re not supposed to lose the State of Massachusetts if you get in there. She’s the Senator. She’s the Senator for Massachusetts, I think she’s going to lose it to Bernie. And Miss Michigan, you see what’s going on over there? Michigan, we’re leading. We’re leading in Wisconsin. We’re leading in Florida. We’re leading-
Donald Trump: (24:01)
… Wisconsin, we’re leading in Florida, we’re leading in South Carolina, we’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading in New Hampshire. We’re leading in the great state of Florida that was one of the first ones [inaudible 00:24:19] in the last election. Hey, how great was the 2016 election? One of the greatest nights, one of the most highest rated television nights in the history of television. And remember, there was oh, this is going to be a quick one. This is going to be… oh, that wasn’t so easy for them. I love the scene. The scene of that convention center where Hillary was getting ready to speak, and then she found out she lost. But Elizabeth Warren’s here to plan to eliminate our borders, or Mini Mike’s plan to eliminate your second amendment. Mike Bloomberg wants to eliminate your second amendment. Don’t worry about it, it’s not going to happen. Not going to happen for him. For sleepy Joe, he doesn’t even know where he is, what he’s doing, or what office he’s running for. Actually, I honestly don’t think he knows what office he’s running for. And it doesn’t matter.
Donald Trump: (25:30)
Maybe he gets in, because he’s a little more moderate. So maybe he gets in. But he’s not going to be running it. Other people are going to. They’re going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country. But they’re going to be super left radical crazies. They’re going to be super left radical crazies, Joe’s going to be in a home. He’ll be watching television. Everything will be just fine. The insanity of Washington Democrats is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican party.
Crowd: (25:59)
Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.
Donald Trump: (26:25)
Turn those [inaudible 00:26:25]. We have the enthusiasm in our party. No, I really mean it. I constantly hear about the enthusiasm. They’re fighting each other, they hate each other, they don’t know what’s going on. We have all the love, we have all the enthusiasm, and we know what we’re doing. We know what we’re doing. So we’re thrilled to be joined tonight by many really great, terrific, brilliant, wonderful warriors. Even though he comes from a slightly different state, but not to far by, is somebody that really has distinguished himself, he’s become a great friend of mine. What he did for Justice Kavanaugh, do you remember that? One of the greatest statements ever made in the United State’s Senate, Senator Lindsey Graham. Come on up, Lindsey. Lindsey Graham, come on up, Lindsey. Come here, Lindsey. I got to have him say something, come here, Lindsey.
Lindsey Graham: (27:59)
Hello, Charlotte. It’s good to be in a place where I don’t have an accent. Mr. President, thank you for being the best Commander in Chief since Ronald Reagan. Thank you for killing the terrorists over there, so they can’t hurt us over here. Thank you for sticking with Judge Kavanaugh. Mr. President, everybody in this room has one thing in common, we all have your back. Mr. President, you are going to kick their ass in November.
Donald Trump: (28:49)
[inaudible 00:28:49] great guy.
Crowd: (28:49)
USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA.
Donald Trump: (29:12)
Great guy, great gentleman. Now some warriors that really defended us with the impeachment hoax, one of great hoaxes in the history of country, Representative Virginia Foxx, Patrick McHenry, Richard Hudson, Mark Meadows, David Rouzer, Ted Budd. They’re warriors, these guys are unbelievable the way they fight. The last straw, I’ll tell you, I came here and then it probably weren’t scheduled to win, and fake news, CNN and [inaudible 00:30:01] they were all set. They [inaudible 00:30:03]. They handle pressure so well. They came and we gave a rally that was like this and Dan Bishop and Gregg Murphy won by so much, it wasn’t even close. They’re great people, and they’ve done a fantastic job. Thank you very much. They handle pressure. They were under a lot of pressure, they handled it well. It’s nice to know people can handle pressure, there aren’t too many of them. North Carolina Republican party chairman Michael Whatley. Thank you, Michael.
Donald Trump: (30:48)
I have a few great friends of mine and they love North Carolina. Louis DeJoy, who you know, Louis DeJoy. Two great people, diamond and silk. Right? Diamond and silk. We love them.
Speaker 2: (31:39)
Okay, y’all know we about to win another election. I saw Mini Mike on Fox.
Speaker 3: (31:40)
Uh-huh (affirmative).
Speaker 2: (31:40)
Mini.
Speaker 3: (31:44)
Mini.
Speaker 2: (31:45)
President Trump is this high.
Speaker 3: (31:45)
Uh-huh (affirmative).
Speaker 2: (31:45)
You got to be this high to ride this ride. Now while the media continue to play the race card, we going to continue to play the Trump card, so we can [inaudible 00:08: 08].
Donald Trump: (32:05)
You know the first lady, a long time ago now, right? How long is that? Probably almost almost five years ago, she said, “There are these two women on the internet, they’re unbelievable. They’re unbelievable.” I said, “Oh, I know, I hear that all the time. I hear it all the time.” She said, the next day she came again. She said, “I saw them again, they’re unbelievable.” I said, “Let me see.” I saw them, I fell in love with it, and everybody fell in love with Diamond and Silk. So thank you.
Donald Trump: (33:00)
Some people that have really been helpful to me, Corey Lewandowski, David Bussey, and Pam Bondi, right here. Thanks also to all of the people who are working to make the 2020 Republican National Convention right here in Charlotte an outstanding success, RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel, RNC co chairman Tommy Hicks, and Convention president Marcia Lee Kelly, thank you all. You’re doing a great job, I’ll tell you they’re looking, they’re going to spend a lot of money and doing a good job. Should we doing a great job, but just an okay job? It doesn’t matter as long as you win. You know what I gave when we won last time, somebody else took them to convention center, spent a fortune and I just took a hotel ballroom. I said, “What the heck, if I win, nobody cares, if I don’t.” Look if you win, nobody cares what room you’re in. If you lose, nobody cares what room you’re in. So we took a ballroom, nice ballroom, that’s it, no big deal. I think it this way, if we win, nobody cares. And if we lose, I’m out of there, I save a hell of a lot of money.
Donald Trump: (34:25)
But I never thought we were going to lose. That’s on of the things they like to spread, “Trump felt that he wasn’t going to win.” Oh yeah, I’m running because I [inaudible 00:10:30], that’s not the deal. I mean it’s always possible that you don’t win, but boy I thought we were going to win and we were getting crowds like this actually, to be honest, I think our crowds now are bigger, stronger, and even more enthusiastic. I really think they’re more enthusiastic than ever before. And then there’s two set we’re eight months away, that’s a long, it’s not even our, in case you haven’t heard, we’ve got it made in the primers. For us, we’re not even really political season and we’re getting crowds like this, we were all over the last couple of weeks. We like to troll. We like to go the night before one of their primers. We do a little trolling, it’s called we do a little trolling. Bernie Sanders was very upset, “Why would he be there?” Why? Because I want to win, I want to keep everybody happy. That’s such a good reason. Honestly, when you’re two months or three months out, we’re getting numbers that are unbelievable. Colorado went, we went to Iowa, every place we’ve gone, New Hampshire. Every place we’ve gone, just came out of South Carolina, you saw that. That was an incredible [inaudible 00:35:57]. Every place that we’ve gone, it’s been amazing. I’d also like to recognize, so important, a woman who’s really helped us win North Carolina in 2016, I have a feeling this year, she’ll even do better, because she happened to grow up here, Lara Trump and my son Eric Trump. Two great people. I mean I have to say that about my son, but I know a lot of people don’t like their sons that much, but Lara has been fantastic, and thank you very much, what a job. She knows this state better than anybody in this room except maybe this guy right here. How are we doing, Lara? How are we doing? How are we doing in the state, are we doing good?
Donald Trump: (36:55)
And we’re doing well in Pennsylvania I hear, and South Carolina, I know we’re doing great there. Also with us tonight, is a man who’s really become a good friend of mine. We were going at it a little bit at the beginning, but I will tell you, and I would say if I didn’t get along, I would not be here. I wouldn’t do this. I think he’s been tremendous. He’s been a tremendous supporter and things that we’ve wanted to do, and fights that we’ve had which were so important, he’s been right up, and Lizzie will tell you that he’s been right up in front and really he deserves another six year term. Probably a lot longer than that, but he’s going to come up and I’m going to ask Senator Thom Tillis, come on up. Thom has really been incredible, he’s been working everyday. And he really wants to fight to the radical left and he does it and he knows how to fight, and take care of our amazing veterans, and stop illegal immigration. Thom is the champion for the people of North Carolina. This November, we need everybody to go and vote for Thom, he’s doing great. He’s doing great. I hear he’s way up in the polls, he’s way up in the polls. Thom, say a few words.
Thom Tillis: (38:17)
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you all for being here, thank you for supporting our President, make sure that I come back for another six years, and we get him back for four more years. Let me tell you about this President, I think it’s very important since before this president was ever sworn in and they were trying to impeach him, did he back down? No. When the media goes out, tries to spread false news or fake news, does he back down?
Crowd: (38:47)
No.
Thom Tillis: (38:48)
When he makes a promise, does he keep it?
Crowd: (38:48)
Yes.
Thom Tillis: (38:49)
When he told you he’d cut taxes, did he do it?
Crowd: (38:51)
Yes.
Thom Tillis: (38:51)
When he told you he would support [inaudible 00:38:54], id he do it?
Crowd: (38:51)
Yes.
Thom Tillis: (38:53)
When he told you that we would refund the military and become the world’s superpower, did he do it?
Crowd: (39:00)
Yeah.
Thom Tillis: (39:00)
When he told you that he was going to confirm Supreme Court Justices, circuit court justices, the district court judges, now 200 of them, did he do it?
Crowd: (39:09)
[inaudible 00:39:11].
Thom Tillis: (39:09)
Ladies and gentlemen, you got to start choice, it starts tomorrow, we’re both on the ballot. You need to vote for us so we can go back and do it again, but let me tell you again, we can’t forget what they’re promising you on the other side of the aisle. Bernie Sanders is so liberal, he doesn’t even call himself a democrat, he calls himself a socialist. This President went to the State of the Union and he said, “America will never be a socialist country.” That’s another promise he’s going to keep. Now mind you ladies and gentleman, I want to thank the President for coming back, and I can’t wait to welcome him in August for the RNC Convention. Quiet. Mr. President there was one thing that you said back at the campaign in 2016, it’s the only thing, I just don’t believe it’s happened, have you gotten tired of winning?
Thom Tillis: (40:08)
Do you want to win some more?
Crowd: (40:08)
[inaudible 00:40:06].
Thom Tillis: (40:08)
Then you got to get this man reelected. SO we can give you the free stuff that a free country deserves, free markets, free trade, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and the freedom for you to protect yourself with your right to bear arms. That’s the freedom that this man represents, that’s the freedom I represent, get him elected for four more years.
Donald Trump: (40:14)
Wow. Hey that’s pretty good, that’s pretty good, Thom. Lot of times we get people up and they just can’t do it. They start breathing bad, they can’t breathe, “Oh help me,” like Bloomberg. Did you see the debate? Huh? She came after him. She’s mean, she’s very mean. She came after him and he started chocking [inaudible 00:41:10] “Get me off this stage. Get me off. You guys didn’t tell me this was going to happen.” No, that was great Thom. We’re also honored to be joined tonight by a true American hero, a veteran of World War II and the Korean War who just turned 100 years old. His name is George Washington Perry, legit. George, thank you very much for being here. Thank you, George. 100 years. He’s 100 and he looks good. Thank you, George. With the help of everyone here tonight, America has now become the hottest economy anywhere on the planet earth. Since my election over 219,000 new jobs have been created right here in North Carolina.
Donald Trump: (42:16)
We have lifted 10,000,000 people off of welfare, including 7,000,000 people off of food stamps. Median household income has reached the highest level ever recorded, think of that. The average unemployment rate from my administration is the lowest for any US president in recorded history, that’s happening, that’s happening. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached the lowest level in recorded history. Very important to me, African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty is that the lowest rate ever recorded. For decades democratic politicians betrayed, and they truly did, they betrayed African Americans. My administration is delivering for African Americans like never before. No president has done more for our black community, no president has done more for our black community, and it’s an honor to do it. Last month here in Charlotte, we launched a nationwide campaign to create a better future for all Americans. It’s called Opportunity Now, you know about it. We’re also fighting to ensure that working families have access to paid family leave, reducing the cost of childcare and giving 40,000,000 american families an average of $2,200 thanks to the Republican child tax credit. The Republicans are claiming that we did that nobody else did, but the Democrats are saying, “How did they do that one?”
Donald Trump: (44:29)
We’re reversing decades of calamitous trade policies and decimated manufacturing in North Carolina, you know all about. It’s probably the number one reason running, and the deals we’re making, the trade deals, are unbelievable. Your state lost 43% of all manufacturing jobs after NAFTA was signed, think of that. Weeks ago, we finally ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new US [inaudible 00:20:57]. The USMCA is a giant for North Carolina’s incredible farmers and factory workers. And by the way, speaking of farms, factory workers, and small businesses, are all for the death tax. You know about the death tax, right? It’s called the inheritance tax. You have a small farm some place, you have a small business, you have a nice business, you no longer have an inheritance tax or a death tax. So if you want to leave it to your children, you can leave it to your children, there’s no tax to be paid by your children. So they don’t have to go back to the evil banker, borrow money from the banker, lose the farm, lose the business, it won’t happen. And I always say, I know a lot of parents that don’t love the children very much.
Donald Trump: (45:54)
Is there anybody in this room that does not love your children? Please raise your hand. Please raise your hand. Nobody. Nobody, that’s because we’re North Carolina, you love your children. But if you don’t, then it doesn’t matter because if you don’t love your children, don’t leave them a damn thing, but you don’t have the inheritance tax anymore, which is great. A lot of people don’t even know that, but that’s a big deal or no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betraying the American people than on the issue of immigration.
Donald Trump: (46:33)
Every Democrat running for president supports free federal welfare for illegal aliens, on your tax. Not only does illegal immigration drain our treasury, but it is threatens innocent lives as just one heartbreaking example, two illegal aliens in Maryland who had been previously charged with attempted murder were released, unaccountably released, and they went on to further a teenage girl beating her with a baseball bat and slashing her with a machete. The entire democratic field supports [inaudible 00:47:15] sanctuary cities, which release dangerous criminals to terrorize your communities. Right here in North Carolina, believe it or not, the sanctuary county of Durham released an illegal alien criminal, who then receded to viciously murdered a young 19 year old woman last year, you know all about it. Killing her and dumping her body into the woods. Last year alone, sanctuary jurisdictions in North Carolina, how did that happen to North Carolina? Deliberately set free hundreds and hundreds of, and these are really dangerous criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of burglary, gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even mur-
Donald Trump: (48:03)
Gun crime, sexual assault, kidnapping, and even murder. Got to change it. Your Democrat Governor, Roy Cooper, vetoed a bill that would save North Carolina lives and ban sanctuary cities [inaudible 00:48:18]. What is he thinking? But while your super Liberal Governor is putting your families at risk, your Republican Senator Thom Tillis has introduced a bill allowing American victims to sue sanctuary cities for the horrible pain and [inaudible 00:49:06] suffering they inflict on our people. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. We’re building the wall. Mexico’s paying for the wall, by the way. We built 127 miles as of today, 127.
Donald Trump: (49:13)
Mexico is paying for the wall. The media is going to be thrilled when I explain that Mexico is paying for the wall because you know, now finally they said I’ve had obstruction like you wouldn’t believe. The entire democratic party. I could get anything. I created Space Force. I could do anything. I could get. Lindsey and Thom Tillis knows. Mark knows this. All of them knows this. If I wanted 25 cents for the wall, they didn’t want to get it. They didn’t want to do it, but now we got it, and you think that’s easy? Nobody else could have done this. We’re building it. We’re building our hearts away. We’ll soon be building many, many miles a week, but we’re up to over 125, I guess 127, 28 by now, of the super duper wall, super duper.
Donald Trump: (49:52)
I went to Border Patrol, I said, ” What is your wish?” “Well, sir, we’d like it to be steel and concrete.” They want it exactly what they have it, and the barriers up top, they want everything. It’s called a no climb provisor, no climb provisor. I said, “What does the word provisor mean?” They didn’t know. All it means is you’re not able to climb over it. It is very tough. I don’t know if you saw. In a part of the wall, a couple of weeks ago, they were climbing the wall, and the fire department had to come and take them down. That’s what the no climb is. That’s what the no climb is. It’s a no climb. It’s more money. It’s a little more expensive. Thank you. Who is that? What a voice. Pavarotti.
Donald Trump: (50:47)
So, we’re building the wall. It’s going great. So, they said, “All right. He’s building the wall, but Mexico’s not paying for it.” Yes, they are. You’ll see. You’ll see. You understand. Some of you understand because I told a few people last week, it got linked to the fake news media. If you want to end sanctuary cities in North Carolina and across America, then you have only one choice. You must vote Republican. You have to. You have to.
Donald Trump: (51:15)
Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we reduced illegal border crossings by a staggering 75% since last [inaudible 00:03:29]. We’ve added catch and release, one of the worst loopholes you’ve ever seen, catch and release. You catch them. You then say, “Where do you live?” They don’t know because look, let’s face it, they don’t know. I understand that. It’s not even to be laughed at. They don’t know. “Where do you live?” I don’t know. Mexico, maybe, Honduras, Guatemala, who knows? El Salvador. “Where do you live?” Like this guy, he’s a Mexican. You’re about as Mexican as I am. Look at this guy. He’s as Mexican as I am. Look at that hat. Are you Mexican? Are you Mexican? No, you’re not. Are you? He is.
Donald Trump: (52:08)
It’s like Elizabeth Warren. She said she was an Indian. I said, “I have more Indian blood in me than you have, and I have none. She said, “Oh, this is terrible.” So she went out and got a test and it turned out not so good for her. Right? 1024th, right? One thousandths, so I was right. I probably have more in me. What a phony she is. What a phony.
Donald Trump: (52:39)
Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. 132 Congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie Sanders’ healthcare takeover. While the Washington Democrats are trying to destroy your healthcare and your social security, and they are going to destroy your social security. Remember they used to say with me, “I’m going to end it the first day.” Well, you know what, we’re going to soon be four years and all I’ve done is make it stronger. You know that. My administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great healthcare. You’re going to have great health. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep the plan of your choice.
Donald Trump: (53:26)
Remember President Obama? You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan. 28 times. They said, “Impeach him. You should impeach him.” 28 times he lied. 28 times on record, “You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan.” Well, that’s not true. It wasn’t. Impeach him. We’re making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the last five years before I took office. We are now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they’re better plans. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will, and we are trying terminate, in the Supreme Court of the United States, the worst healthcare in the world, and we are going to give you the best healthcare you’ve ever seen at a low price and again, protecting preexisting conditions. Protecting preexisting conditions.
Donald Trump: (54:29)
We’re fighting to stop surprise medical billing. You know what that is? Surprise. You get all sorts of surprises. We have people that take a blood test in one place, it’s $26, and in another place it’s $2000. Same blood test, maybe the cheap one is better, who knows? Same blood test. It’s wrong. Surprise medical building. Bombed. Out. Billing.
Donald Trump: (54:55)
I signed an executive order opposing price transparency that’s going to be bigger than healthcare, because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. Right? It’s a big thing. It’s a big thing. We’ve approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as name brand drugs, but a fraction of the cost. We have given them, and there’s a lot of political pressure not to do that, you can understand why.
Donald Trump: (55:26)
To care for our amazing veterans, we passed VA Choice and VA Accountability, and nobody said it could be done. So now, instead of waiting in line for days and days, and weeks and weeks to see a doctor, you go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get all fixed up. What a great thing. It’s called VA Choice. I got it done. They’ve been trying to pass it for almost 50 years and they haven’t been able to. Those people over there were a great help. We have passed the spectacular Right to Try. You know what that is? Hopefully nobody in the room needs. Hopefully nobody in the room needs Right to Try. We are combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We’ve launched new initiatives combating kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, and we’re pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America’s youngest patients, and breaking all records in so doing. Virtually every Democratic candidate has declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb, right up until the very moment of birth. How about that? That is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion of babies, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift of God.
Donald Trump: (57:14)
Then you have the Governor of Virginia. The baby is born. The baby is born and he says, “And then you go over and start talking to the mother as to whether or not you execute the baby.” This is the Governor of Virginia. The Governor of Virginia. He’s a beauty. You remember what he did? He wanted to dance like Michael Jackson and his wife stopped him. He got lucky. But the Governor of Virginia wanted to do that. The baby is born and then he goes over and talks to the mother. The doctor will now talk, and you’ll make a decision as to whether or not the baby lives. Did you ever hear of anything like this?
Donald Trump: (57:59)
The Democratic party is the party of high taxes, high crime, unlimited regulations, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. So many people came up to me tonight and they want me to fight, and we’re doing it for school choice, so that every child who needs it, gets it. No parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school.
Donald Trump: (58:55)
I passed criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Alice Johnson, do we love Alice Johnson? This could not have been done by anyone other than the Republican party.
Donald Trump: (59:16)
I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our historic investments in the United States military include $200 million to a place that nobody’s heard of in this audience, I’m sure, Fort Bragg. $300 million for Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point. More than $500 million for Marine Corps Air Station New River.
Donald Trump: (59:58)
Listen to this one. No Democrat’s going to this. They don’t even want to spend money on the military. They don’t like the military. They’re not going to spend money. $1.2 billion for Camp Lejeune. $1.2 billion. Do you think that a guy like sleepy Joe’s going to put, he doesn’t know what it means. I know what I means. We have to have a strong military. We have the strongest military we’ve ever had. When I came in, our military was in sad shape. It was depleted, but we’ve rebuilt it, $2.5 trillion dollars went into our military.
Donald Trump: (01:00:43)
For years you’ve watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the people of North Carolina and always will. [inaudible 01:01:01] is the actual survival of an our nation itself. If you want your children to inherit the blessings of generations of Americans who fought and died to secure, and you know what they’re securing, they are securing us, they’re securing our freedom, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November, November 3rd to be exact.
Donald Trump: (01:01:28)
Only this way can we save the America we love, and drain the Washington swamp, which is by the way, much more vicious, much dirtier, much deeper than I ever thought, but we are kicking ass. With your help, we will lift billions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration, and we will continue with the great Thom Tillis. We will get Thom Tillis. Thom, I don’t think anybody even wants to run against you, Thom, but we’re going to reelect Thom Tillis. Is that right? We’re going to reelect Thom Tillis. If we don’t, I’m going to be so angry at you. I’ll only come back here a few times a year.
Donald Trump: (01:02:39)
No, Thom is going to be great. Thom, I think you’re in great shape. I think you’re in great shape. One more hand for Thom Tillis, please. We don’t even know who’s running against him. Nobody wants the run.
Donald Trump: (01:02:58)
We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful, beautiful, beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right? Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in less than nine years. We’ve already started. Who would have thought? We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty and the right to keep and bear arms.
Donald Trump: (01:03:41)
Your second amendment rights are under siege. Believe me, they’re under siege. We don’t get in, you can forget your second amendment. That’s what I think. I really believe it. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that binds us together as one beautiful America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work, and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust.
Donald Trump: (01:05:16)
From Fayetteville to Wilmington, from Raleigh to Greensboro, from Asheville to Kitty Hawk, to right here in Charlotte, this state is the home to some of the toughest men and strongest women, and most incredible patriots ever to walk the face of the Earth. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, blazed the trail, sailed the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, won two world wars, defeated fascism, and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater every single day.
Donald Trump: (01:06:12)
Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people, that’s what’s happening. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of North Carolina, the best is yet to come. Because together, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we have made America great again.
Donald Trump: (01:07:13)
Thank you. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:07:13)

"Mar 2, 2020",9:06 P.M. EST,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Discuss how the federal government can accelerate the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatments for the coronavirus. We want to welcome Dr. Deborah Birx. And Dr. Birx has been to the White House a lot over her career, and she’s now going to be here working with Mike Pence and everybody full-time. And we appreciate it. We appreciate it very much, Dr. Birx, and a real expert in her field. And if you’d like, you can ask her a couple of questions when we’re finished.
Donald Trump: (00:31)
We’re working very hard to expedite the longer process of developing a vaccine. We’re also moving with maximum speed to develop therapies so that we can help people recover as quickly as possible. We have a lot of recovery going on. We want to see if we can advance that. It’s likely that therapies will be available before a vaccine is actually ready and we’ll seek to bring all effective treatments to market as soon as possible. Some very good work has been done on the vaccine. However, they have some good progress and you’ll be able to ask a couple of questions of the folks here. We’re also working with Congress to ensure that America has what it needs to respond to this challenge, this great challenge, but everybody’s responding very well. Since the start of the outbreak, my administration has taken the most aggressive action in history to protect our citizens, including closing our borders very early, a lot earlier than people wanted us to do and that turned out to be a good decision.
Donald Trump: (01:31)
I ordered sweeping travel restrictions, increased travel advisory levels, established screening measures and opposed historic quarantines. We have quarantines all over the country. A lot of the Coronavirus shows the importance of bringing manufacturing back to America so that we are producing at home, the medicines and equipment and everything else that we need to protect the public’s health. And I’ve been talking about this for a long time.
Donald Trump: (01:59)
That process has already started. It started long before we ever knew about this. We want to make certain things at home. We want to be doing our manufacturing at home. It’s not only done in China, it’s done in many other places, including Ireland and a lot of places make our different drugs and things that we need so badly. And it’s not good to be dealing with one or two or three countries and we do very little at home and we’re going to start doing it at home.
Donald Trump: (02:28)
And we’ve been talking about that for long time. And a lot of the drug companies, because of what we’ve done in terms of incentives and taxes, they’re heading back here anyway. The Coronavirus shows the importance of bringing all of that manufacturing back to America, and we will have that started. It’s already started, frankly. It started about a year ago.
Donald Trump: (02:50)
The White House Coronavirus Task Force led by Vice President Mike Pence has been meeting daily and coordinating closely with the state and local governments. Mike had a call today with 53 governors and I heard it was a very good call and everybody’s very well coordinated and the Governors and the States, all of them, I can’t think of an exception, they’ve been really working closely with us. It’s been a very good relationship.
Donald Trump: (03:18)
We will confront this challenge together and we will continue to do exactly what we’re doing and we’re going to be very successful. A lot of things are happening, a lot of very exciting things are happening and they’re happening very rapidly. So with that, I’d like to introduce Mike and you can say a little bit as to your calls and some of the things that are happening today.
Mike Pence: (03:40)
Well, thank you Mr. President and the White House Corona Task Force, we’ll be meeting again this afternoon. But as you mentioned earlier today, at your direction, we hosted a video and telephone conference call with 53 governors. As the President said many times, we’re all in this together. And today’s meeting is a reflection of the fact that this President understands that industry is a part of the one team in America that’s going to address the coronavirus in this country.
Mike Pence: (04:10)
And I’m grateful for these leaders of the nation’s top pharmaceutical companies to come in to speak to us about the development of vaccines, but also the development of therapeutic medications that can be available in the short term, and we’re grateful for your participation. The President will also be traveling tomorrow to the National Institute of Health, CDC, before the week is out and we will be meeting with leaders of the airline industry.
Mike Pence: (04:39)
We’ll be meeting with leaders of the cruise line industry. And we welcome the partnership with industry in this country as we work out the President’s top priority, which is the health and safety and wellbeing of the American people. And let me also, Mr. President, extend my welcome to Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the leading experts in infectious diseases in the world. She has served in uniform in the United States. She has served in multiple administrations and she’s going to be our right arm here as we implement your vision for putting the health and safety and wellbeing of the American people first. So with that, Mr. President, I know Secretary Azar has a few thoughts and look forward to the meeting.
Donald Trump: (05:30)
And Alex maybe you can give a little update and then we’ll go around the room and people can introduce themselves, if that’s okay? Go ahead, please.
Alex Azar: (05:36)
Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. We continue to see cases here in the United States. As you know, we tragically have experienced several more deaths reported today and our condolences go out to their families of course. That’s why the President’s leading this whole government response at the direction of the Vice President.
Alex Azar: (05:56)
We’re here working with the pharmaceutical company leaders on three key issues: how do we speed vaccines, how do we speed therapeutics and what are the supply chain challenges that we may be facing for pharmaceutical products here in the United States? With regard to therapeutics and vaccines, we want to know how we can not get in the way but rather speed that development process along.
Alex Azar: (06:20)
And I want to make sure that they all know that we’ve got Commissioner Hahn here from the FDA and this is all in the context of emergency powers, emergency use authorizations and the President will be asking you, how can we make it faster? How can we make anything faster? How can we challenge some of those normal pharma timelines? That can be a little slow and bureaucratic. What can we do to speed that along given the nature of this emergency and be a good partner with you in making that happen, especially once we get the emergency supplemental passed by Congress in the next week or so. So with that said, Mr. President, thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (06:56)
Supplemental is moving along very rapidly. Everyone wants to get that done. Moving along quickly, Emma, please.
Emma Walmsley: (07:05)
Emma Walmsley from GlaxoSmithKline. First of all, I’d like to really say how much we welcome the leadership, Mr. President, of this task force, the NIH and BARDA, and recognize the very substantial efforts that have already been made by the administration to protect people here in the US. As a science led company with a very large, including manufacturing, presence here, we know we have a responsibility and a vital role to play.
Emma Walmsley: (07:29)
And our priority is to make sure we make available, as part of this one team, our pandemic adjuvant technology available to any company with a highly promising vaccine because this new technology could make these other vaccines either bring more efficacy or indeed allow them to be antigen sparing, which means we could protect more people. Which is obviously incredibly important as we’re trying to work at pace and at scale.
Emma Walmsley: (08:00)
We’ve already announced two collaborations and hope to announce more and we’re also ready to produce, should the US Government require it, a stockpile of this adjuvant. We know fighting COVID-19 requires a global effort and the US is the vital leader in this and we’re absolutely committed to play our part in the task force.
Donald Trump: (08:23)
Thank you, Emma. Beautiful. Thank you very much. Please, Anthony, go ahead. I’d like you to say something anyway, I think [inaudible 00:08:31].
Anthony Fauci: (08:30)
I’m Tony Fauci, the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Very pleased to be on this task force, which I think you’re going to see is working extraordinarily smoothly under the leadership of the Vice President and Secretary Azar. And as you know, we’re involved and that’s the reason why I am pleased to be in this room with you all because we are involved in the fundamental basic and clinical research to develop countermeasures in the form of therapeutics and vaccines and I’m sure I’ll be working with many of you around the room and I look forward to it. Thank you, Mr. Presidnet.
Donald Trump: (09:00)
Thank you, Tony, very much. Bob?
Bob Redfield: (09:03)
Thank you, Mr. Presidnet. Bob Redfield, the Director of CDC. I also want to thank you all for being here. I want to extend that if there’s anything CDC can also do as you begin to try to evaluate some of your fruits of your labor, we’re here to make that what we have available to help. We’re all counting on the new countermeasures to be in the arena pretty quickly.
Donald Trump: (09:30)
Thank you, Bob. Please.
Daniel Menichella: (09:32)
Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. Thanks for having me here. Good afternoon, I’m Dan Menichella, CEO of CureVac. We are a clinical stage biotech company. We use messenger RNA technology, optimized messenger RNA molecules once injected into the body they instruct the cells on how to make proteins. For instance, we can use the MRNA technology to trigger an immune response against viruses or we can get the body to increase its production of T-cells for cancer vaccines.
Daniel Menichella: (09:59)
In this way CureVac can make potent prophylactic vaccines and cancer treatments. The technology also works well to replace missing proteins so we can also work in a rare disease case. One strength of our technology is that we can produce prophylactic vaccines using a very low dose. For instance, the phase one rabies trial that we just completed was done at a one microgram dose. In other words, millionth of a gram dose, a very, very tiny dose.
Daniel Menichella: (10:24)
And so more broadly, our company focuses … This year we have four programs in phase one clinical trials and the coronavirus program will be the fifth program in phase one. We expect that the phase one program for coronavirus will start beginning of June. Our technology platform is fast and it’s agile. We were the first messenger RNA company to have GMP manufacturing. We started in 2006. Currently we have three large scale GMP facilities and we are up and running up now.
Daniel Menichella: (10:52)
Today we have a fourth facility built and we’re looking for additional capex to put the machinery in there. Once we have that machinery in the fourth building, we can make hundreds of millions of doses of the coronavirus vaccine. We’re very excited about that and we want to help there.
Daniel Menichella: (11:07)
Additionally, we have developed a fully automated production machine. This automated machine is part of the collaboration with CEPI and additionally with CEPI we are working on the coronavirus. They have funded our efforts to get the program and the vaccine through phase one by June. The key point here being that we believe we can develop the vaccine for COVID-19 very, very quickly and we have the where with all to manufacturer it, although we would like some additional help on our largest GMP four facility. Again, we appreciate the opportunity to be here today and thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (11:36)
Thank you very much. Appreciate it. John, go ahead, please.
John Shiver: (11:42)
Sure. I’m John Shiver, Head of Vaccine Research Fraud and Development for Sanofi Vaccine. Sanofi has been making vaccines for over 100 years. And for this project we’re working with proprietary, recombinant, protein technology that makes the first flu vaccine, that’s not an X. That’s based on this technology.
John Shiver: (12:03)
It has the potential to be applied very readily to coronavirus. Some early work done with SARS, the related virus, was very promising. We intend to leverage that work so that we can get to the clinic as soon as possible because we are a major flu vaccine producer, with this technology, we have the ability to produce large amounts of vaccine. We predict, depending upon the final formulation, 100 to 600 million doses per year made in New York and Pennsylvania, which is where we make about 90% of our flu product.
John Shiver: (12:36)
And we can do this without jeopardizing our flu vaccine production. Importantly, because we know that’s very important to maintain that. Mr. President, we’re willing to do whatever it takes to work with you and this administration, the collaboration we’ve had with NIH and with BARDA, who’s co-sponsoring our research to make sure that we do what we can to help with this problem.
Donald Trump: (12:55)
When do you think you could have the vaccine? When do you think you’d be able to have it, start producing it?
John Shiver: (13:00)
We’re producing it now. The experimental lot, proteins take somewhat longer than some of the other technologies, more exploratory, but it’s approached, it’s a technology that works. We think we can be ready for the clinic in a year. And depending upon the nature of how the epidemic goes or doesn’t go, and with the help of the agencies of this country, perhaps as few as several years. Difficult to predict, Mr. President, knowing that a vaccine has to be both safe and efficacious because it’s given to healthy people.
Donald Trump: (13:31)
All right. Okay. Thank you very much. Lenny?
Lenny Schleifer: (13:35)
Thanks, Mr. President for having us. I’m Lenny Schleifer the founder and CEO of Regeneron, a company that I built with the George Yancopoulos over the last 30 years. And we are a monoclonal antibody primarily centered company. We are no strangers to collaborating with the administration. We work with Secretary Azar’s group, BARDA, and we came up with a cure for Ebola. And we’re very proud of that.
Lenny Schleifer: (14:01)
Dr. Fauci’s group was really instrumental in testing that under unbelievable conditions in the Congo. And it didn’t create quite as much excitement because thank goodness it didn’t hit our shores, but we can use the exact same technology and we already have, we have 1000 antibodies that are already sitting in dishes. We’re screening them, we’re selecting them. We anticipate if all goes well, 200,000 doses per month can come out of our factory in New York starting in August. The unique thing about our technology-
Donald Trump: (14:31)
That means you’d be able to use a vaccine that early?
Lenny Schleifer: (14:35)
Depends on what we see, how we work closely with the FDA, which we will do. The FDA has already reached out to us, but we’ve got to work closely-
Donald Trump: (14:43)
That process would be faster than John’s?
Lenny Schleifer: (14:46)
It would be.
John Shiver: (14:46)
Can you explain why that would be?
Lenny Schleifer: (14:50)
Well, so we make passive vaccine and therapeutic. Our drug will be able to protect you, whether or not you’re infected, it’ll protect you from getting infected or if you are infected, it would treat you. And we have just taken processes that normally take years, literally years, and we put them end to end and now do them in weeks to months that nobody else in the industry can do. So we’re very excited to collaborate once again.
Donald Trump: (15:22)
So this would be a combination of a vaccine and also it will put it in a different way, make you better quicker.
Lenny Schleifer: (15:28)
Yeah. Well think of it this way. If you get immunized with one of these vaccines, you’re going to make some antibodies to protect you. We’re going to already make those antibodies and give them to you so you don’t have to go through that whole process, so it will protect you. And as we showed with Ebola, you give enough of them, it was lifesaving, truly lifesaving.
Donald Trump: (15:47)
That’s true.
Lenny Schleifer: (15:47)
It beat out anti virals, it really was the way to go. It’s very predictable. I just want to say I hope everybody succeeds here. This is bringing everybody together here is really critical and there’s going to be success. This industry is really talented as an industry. Sometimes we run astray, but we’re going to get this done.
Donald Trump: (16:08)
Thank you very much. Thanks, Lenny. Appreciate it. Please.
Stephane Bancel: (16:12)
Thank you, Mr. President, for the invitation. Stephane Bancel the CEO of Moderna. So, Moderna team [inaudible 00:16:18] very proud to be a working with US Government, and to have already sent in only 42 days from the sequence of a virus, our vaccine to a Dr. Fauci’s Team at the NIH. And we’re now waiting for the vaccine to be green light from the FDA so that the team can start dosing as soon as possible. What is very interesting about our technology is that we use messenger RNA.
Stephane Bancel: (16:42)
So basically it’s an information molecule that allows us to move very quickly from vagility to formation of a virus, to having a vaccine. So we have already have nine vaccine in the clinic, in the US, in Germany, and in Australia. We have five of those for respiratory diseases. We work with the partnered with data from Department Of Defense, with BARDA [inaudible 00:17:02] we’re having ongoing discussions. We were able to go so fast because we are working for many years with the NIH and we had worked with Dr. Fauci’s team on the MERs vaccine for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, which is coronavirus.
Stephane Bancel: (17:18)
And so we’re able to move very, very fast from a few phone calls to getting a vaccine made ready for the clinic. We’re now working on the phase two material. So that as soon as we get the phase one dose out of the NIH, we’ll be able to start the phase two right away.
Donald Trump: (17:32)
And what is your timing then? What would you say?
Stephane Bancel: (17:35)
So we’re hoping to get the phase one start very soon now, we’re just waiting for a green light. The product is at the NIH and then it’ll be a few months to get the human data that will allow us to pick a therapeutic dose to start the [inaudible 00:17:50] right away.
Donald Trump: (17:50)
So you’re talking over the next few months you think you can have a vaccine?
Stephane Bancel: (17:53)
Correct. For phase two.
Donald Trump: (17:55)
Yeah.
Anthony Fauci: (17:56)
You won’t have a vaccine. You’ll have a vaccine to go and get tested.
Stephane Bancel: (17:59)
For phase tow, yes.
Donald Trump: (18:01)
And how long would that take?
Stephane Bancel: (18:05)
The phase two would take a few months before we can go into phase three.
Donald Trump: (18:06)
So you’re talking within a-
Anthony Fauci: (18:07)
A year. Like I’ve been telling you, Mr. President.
Emma Walmsley: (18:09)
[crosstalk 00:18:09] So 18 months.
Anthony Fauci: (18:09)
A year to a year an a half.
Donald Trump: (18:09)
Lenny’s talking about two months.
Lenny Schleifer: (18:09)
And we would be there in June. We will be there in June, in phase [crosstalk 00:18:18]-
Donald Trump: (18:18)
In a couple of months.
Lenny Schleifer: (18:18)
Yes.
Donald Trump: (18:20)
I mean, I like the sound of a couple of months better. Let’s be honest.
Alex Azar: (18:23)
But when you say June phase one initiation then right? In June? Not a completed vaccine is what I mean.
Lenny Schleifer: (18:29)
Yeah, well it would be a vaccine that would be ready for testing in phase one [crosstalk 00:00:18:31]-
Donald Trump: (18:33)
Ready to use [crosstalk 00:18:33]-
Lenny Schleifer: (18:33)
Got it completed.
Donald Trump: (18:35)
Ready to use when? Would you say. Ready to use?
John Shiver: (18:38)
On the public?
Daniel Menichella: (18:39)
I think-
Donald Trump: (18:39)
For next season.
Daniel Menichella: (18:40)
So assuming that the vaccine is well tolerated and safe and efficacious, as John said then I think the question is how do we work with the FDA to expedite that as fast as possible to some sort of fast track program to get it through phase two and three testing to get to [crosstalk 00:18:54]-
Donald Trump: (18:54)
Go quickly.
Daniel Menichella: (18:54)
So, as quickly as possible.
Donald Trump: (18:55)
What do you say to that, Lenny?
Lenny Schleifer: (18:58)
Look, I sense a cautiousness of Dr. Fauci, and he’s right to be cautious.
Speaker 1: (19:03)
It’s the cautiousness of Dr. Fouchey, and he’s right to be cautious because vaccines have to be tested because there is precedent for vaccines to actually make diseases worse. And you really don’t want to make it… You don’t want to rush and treat a million people and find out you’re making 900,000 of them worse.
President Trump: (19:17)
That’s a good idea.
Speaker 1: (19:17)
So yeah. So that’s, I think, why Dr. Fouchey is being a little bit cautious. I don’t want to speak for him. We need to prove that. I think that with our technology, by knowing that we have neutralizing antibodies that we give, we know that this approach worked for Ebola. We know that it worked for MERS in animals. We’d have a greater degree of confidence that this would work sooner, I think.
President Trump: (19:42)
Okay.
Speaker 1: (19:42)
But that’s just the way it is.
President Trump: (19:44)
Thank you very much. Daniel.
Daniel: (19:46)
Yeah, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, thank you for having us here. I’m going to switch it up a little bit. We’re not a vaccine company. We’re a therapeutic company focused on antivirals.
President Trump: (19:54)
Good. Let’s talk about that.
Daniel: (19:55)
Gilead Sciences, I know has worked with a lot of people around the table here. Let me first take the opportunity to thank you for the efforts of the administration, the Secretary on the HIV Elimination Program, which we’re closely connected with.
President Trump: (20:07)
Right. Incredible what they done with HIV, incredible.
Daniel: (20:08)
To be able to prevent and treat this disease is just extraordinary.
President Trump: (20:11)
So we’re saying 10 years, but now we’re into 9 years because it could have been started earlier and somebody else didn’t start it earlier. But we started it right away. And I’m now saying, I started off saying 10 years, now I’m down to nine years. Do you think by the end of nine years, HIV is where?
Daniel: (20:28)
I hope we can eliminate it in the developed world.
President Trump: (20:30)
Can you imagine? We’ll be eliminated in this country.
Daniel: (20:32)
Because we have the ability to prevent it now.
President Trump: (20:34)
That’s such a great thing.
Daniel: (20:35)
And if you can get to the people to really prevent it and then treat everybody. I think it’s certainly something we’re fully committed to.
President Trump: (20:40)
If you remember back 10 years ago, horrible that was and a little beyond the 10 years and now, to think about what’s happened. So Daniel, let’s talk about this-
Daniel: (20:50)
We’re using that same anti-viral experience that Gilead has had decades too now to apply it to coronavirus. So we have a medicine called Remdesivir, which is like a decade-long development that’s an antiviral used to treat coronaviruses, the same viruses, the same family of SARS and MERS. And we’re hoping it has an effect now against the Covid-19. So we know in-vitro that it has very high effect.
President Trump: (21:16)
So you have a medicine that’s already involved with the coronaviruses and now you have to see if it’s specifically for this. When?
Daniel: (21:25)
Correct.
President Trump: (21:25)
You can know that tomorrow, can’t you?
Daniel: (21:27)
So now the critical thing is to do clinical trials, and we’re in the process. We have two clinical trials going on in China that were started several weeks ago. They’re 400 patient trials each. They’re getting close to halfway enrolled or-
President Trump: (21:41)
Any response yet?
Daniel: (21:42)
Well, we don’t know because they’re double-blind randomized trials, so we have to wait until the conclusion of the trial. We expect to get that information in April. Then we’ve been working with Tony and the group at NIH to have another protocol, an NAAID that will also be a protocol that we’ll use in China, outside of China, here in the United States to test for the virus. And we have two other clinical trials that we’re going to initiate next week.
President Trump: (22:06)
Anything here? Anything?
Daniel: (22:07)
Yes, yes. Well, the NAAID trial already had its first patients in Nebraska. And I think Tony, we’re working on getting-
Tony: (22:14)
In Washington also.
Daniel: (22:15)
In Washington state now.
President Trump: (22:16)
Would you go to Washington state where it seems to have the problem?
Daniel: (22:19)
Absolutely. So the intention is to begin-
President Trump: (22:22)
I think it’s a great idea.
Daniel: (22:22)
… with patients here in the coming days.
President Trump: (22:23)
Yeah.
Daniel: (22:24)
Because the trial is really ready to go. So we’re fully-
President Trump: (22:27)
You can go to specifically the nursing home where that outbreak?
Daniel: (22:30)
Yes, and the community, of course, that that touches because all the healthcare workers and that, the family members that have-
President Trump: (22:36)
When will that take place?
Daniel: (22:38)
Literally, I think, Tony, go ahead. I think it’s the next couple of days.
Tony: (22:41)
Probably a couple of days, yeah.
President Trump: (22:42)
If Tony is involved, it’ll be tomorrow morning.
Daniel: (22:45)
But this is a collaboration. We worked on the protocol together. Obviously, we’re providing the investigational medicine. We’re working hand in glove with many people around the table to make sure that whether it’s FDA, or CDC, or NIH.
President Trump: (22:58)
So when will you know of it works? I mean you already have this medicine. When will you know?
Daniel: (23:02)
Well, I think we’ll know in the April timeframe.
President Trump: (23:04)
That’s good.
Daniel: (23:05)
Yeah.
Speaker 2: (23:06)
Do you all, if you’re able to say, do you have any negative kick outs like futility analyses or DSNB reviews that will occur that-
Daniel: (23:13)
There is DSNB review in and the trial in China. They would probably take a look at some of that data in March. So far there’s that would be only stopped though for safety reasons.
Speaker 2: (23:22)
Okay.
Daniel: (23:23)
You really have to wait until the end of the trial to see efficacy. So we’re moving as fast as we can. I think everybody around the table is moving as fast as we can. And on top of that, of course, we have to anticipate success that we’re significantly investing in the manufacturing facility and capacity. We’ve been working closely with the administration to make sure we keep that supply chain.
President Trump: (23:39)
And you’ve already built the facility to manufacture?
Daniel: (23:42)
We have facilities that we’re repurposing for the coronavirus.
President Trump: (23:45)
This would be tremendous news if that works because you’re there. I mean you’re there. You have the plant. Do you have everything ready?
Daniel: (23:51)
We have a trial in severe patients and in more moderate patients, and we’re trying to understand as we all are with the epidemiology of this disease, where and when is the best place to treat.
President Trump: (24:01)
That’s very exciting. Get it done, Daniel.
Daniel: (24:02)
We’re on it.
President Trump: (24:03)
Don’t disappoint us, Daniel. Do you understand that? Great company, really great company. Thank you. Doctor, perhaps you’d like to say a few words, please.
Doctor: (24:12)
Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. It’s really an honor to be here with you. I’m really interested in hearing on the efforts that are ongoing. You know that we’re working with you very closely now, with many of you, and it’s been a great relationship. We’re very interested. This is the message I want to send, we’re very interested in facilitating the development of therapeutics, diagnostics, vaccines for the benefit of the American people. And we, of course, want them to be safe and efficacious, but really look forward to working with you on this. Thank you.
President Trump: (24:39)
Thank you. Thank you. You do a fantastic job.
Doctor: (24:42)
Thank you, Doug.
President Trump: (24:43)
Please.
Pfizer: (24:45)
Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, I’m chief scientist for Pfizer. We are very pleased to be here. And for us, it’s been always important when major public health threats to come together across the industry with biotechs and federal agencies. So we were highly appreciative of the initiative that you’ve taken in this powerful way to have all of us around this table.
Pfizer: (25:11)
Pfizer, as you know, is a proud American company. We have 170 years of experience, originally founded in Brooklyn and headquartered in New York, and we have brought many vaccines, therapeutics of the small or large types for patients suffering from many different diseases including infectious diseases. Now, specifically for the Covid-19, the coronavirus, we have identified compounds, medicines that we have that we think, due to their activity against very related viruses, have good high probability to be active against Covid-19.
Pfizer: (25:51)
And in March, we are confirming that assumption with laboratories that have access to do this hazardous work of using the live virus to confirm activity. That would allow us to work closely with Dr. Horn here at the FDA and identify the fastest path to bring it to patients. That should happen if things go well this year. And as soon as possible I can hear your encouragement to all of us.
Pfizer: (26:24)
I wanted also to say that Pfizer has a 30 R&D and manufacturing sites in the US, more than 30,000 Americans involved in making or discovery medicines, and we’re willing to share our experience, our capabilities as a team here to make sure that the public in America gets the best solutions.
President Trump: (26:46)
Do you expect to be dealing with each other a little bit? You’re competitors, but in this case it’s different. This is something we want to get done very quickly. Do you expect to be sharing your own capabilities with Pfizer and everybody else?
Tony: (26:58)
Absolutely.
President Trump: (26:59)
Good.
Pfizer: (27:00)
I think the call to action that has come from you makes all of us feel that we should be one team here.
President Trump: (27:05)
I agree. We would appreciate that.
Pfizer: (27:07)
As a closing remark, we’ve had a tremendous partnership with NIH and NIAID in many areas pioneering to bring medicine or advances forward with CDC dialogues and with FDA here. So for us, we look forward to extend this relationship to make sure that Americans can, as fast as possible given your encouragement to us, and with having different options to protect them, protection is by vaccines to deal with those that are exposed. We need treatments and those that are ill will need treatment. So it’s not just one solution. I think from this team we should offer multiple approaches, therapeutic and vaccines for patients.
President Trump: (27:53)
Do you see that happening because I noticed you have a few different variants of what we’re talking about? Do you see that happening where maybe there are different either therapeutics, or vaccines, or both where you use combinations of each in different areas?
Pfizer: (28:08)
You are right on the frontier of science. It is about combination. And even looking at our colleagues here at Gilead, we have learned that if you have two different mechanisms and put them together as treatment, the likelihood of curing or very long lasting responses is higher. And we actually work on complimentary mechanisms.
President Trump: (28:27)
I think that’s fantastic.
Daniel: (28:28)
It’s been the story of HIV.
President Trump: (28:29)
I love it. Yeah. I love the complimentary. If you can do that, I love the complementary.
Pfizer: (28:34)
You can count on [inaudible 00:28:35].
President Trump: (28:35)
Yeah, that’s fantastic. Thank you very much. That’s really very exciting. Please.
Joseph Kim: (28:40)
Mr. President, Mr. Vice president. My name is Joseph Kim. I run a company called Inovio Pharmaceuticals out of Pennsylvania. We’re a proud American biotech company with R&D and manufacturing in California as well. Inovio is the leader in coronavirus vaccine development in the world. We have a phase two product for a related MERS coronavirus vaccine in phase two stage. When the new outbreak occurred, we applied our very innovative 21st-century platform called DNA Medicines Platform to Covid-19.
Joseph Kim: (29:24)
By getting just the DNA sequence of the virus, we were able to fully construct our vaccine within three hours. And we’ve been working on preclinical and preparation work with the help of the FDA, and acceleration, and really working very well together. Our plan is to start the US-based clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine in April of this year followed by shortly thereafter a trial in China and South Korea. There are a lot more infections in those areas.
President Trump: (30:02)
We can give you an area too where we. Now we can. I mean, you take a look at Seattle again, we can give you an area.
Joseph Kim: (30:08)
Absolutely.
President Trump: (30:08)
If you don’t mind, yeah.
Joseph Kim: (30:11)
We’ve been collaborating with US agencies like DARPA, NIH. We collaborated with Dr. Bergstein HIV vaccines many, many years ago. With existing resources and capacity, by end of this year, Inovio could deliver about one million doses, but to scale by end of this year. But to scale beyond that, we need your help, Mr. President. We need to work with you and your agencies, Barta and others to help us scale our vaccine to manufacture in America, to protect American public, also to lead the world in vaccine development from America. Thank you very much.
President Trump: (30:59)
All right, thank you very much. You’ll have our help. Thank you. Please.
Paul Stoffels: (31:04)
Mr. President, Mr. Vice president, I’m Paul Stoffels. I’m Vice chairman and Chief Scientific Office for Johnson & Johnson and in direct vaccine research since 30 years. I did several drugs for HIV. At the moment, working within the vaccine platform, which has been deployed or is being deployed in HIV. We did in the times of Zika as well as now in Ebola. We are working with Tony on a phase two and phase three study with the HIV, with the same platform. With Barta, We have extensively collaborated on an Ebola vaccine.
Paul Stoffels: (31:37)
At the moment, we are vaccinating a thousand people a day in Rwanda and in DRC showing the safety of the … and the same vaccine platform we are now deploying for corona. And since the availability of the information on the virus mid January, we have been working day and night on getting to a vaccine. The first versions of that are being tested in animals at the moment with positive results. And in parallel, the company has decided to start upscaling now. Time to resolve will depend to on GMP manufacturing, safety, preclinical safety. You have to work closely together with the FDA that.
Paul Stoffels: (32:18)
Before the year and hopefully in November, we have the first clinical data starting. And early next year, the results of that. And at the same time, you’re looking for significant quantity of vaccines being already produced in that timeframe. But you can’t do anything else then. At the moment, starting parallel, the biological clinical work and parallel doing the upscaling. And let’s see where we end as fast as possible.
President Trump: (32:44)
Did you have different concepts and methods than, you know, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson? All great companies. Are you having different? Some seem to be faster than others, and others, they do seem to be different concepts.
Paul Stoffels: (32:59)
The difference in the concept is that we are using a cold virus, an Athena vector, which there is a place where you can place a piece of corona, Ebola, or HIV. So we treat the body with another virus and generate the antibodies like that.
President Trump: (33:14)
And that’s different from the others?
Paul Stoffels: (33:16)
That’s different from the others. The difference is also it’s been used for many years now. It has been proven for many years that you can do it like that. And we also have a validated upscaling platform which can produce millions of doses in a very short timeframe. And that’s a parallel process where we developed a cell line, which, if we follow what we could do with Ebola, we could produce up to hundreds of millions of vaccines in a small, let’s say reasonably small, facility for manufacturing.
President Trump: (33:45)
So can you have it ready for next season, any of you? I mean would you say for next season?
Paul Stoffels: (33:49)
The next season should be-
President Trump: (33:50)
That would be your goal.
Paul Stoffels: (33:52)
Yeah. But like many people said-
President Trump: (33:53)
It seems to be very seasonal, right?
Paul Stoffels: (33:55)
We have to be very careful here if you vaccinate several hundred million.
President Trump: (33:59)
You’ve got to make sure it works.
Paul Stoffels: (34:00)
Works and it’s safe.
President Trump: (34:02)
And doesn’t hurt. Right. I agree. I agree. Thank you very much. Thank you. Great company. Thank you.
Speaker 1: (34:08)
Dr. [inaudible 00:34:09].
President Trump: (34:10)
Would you like to say something?
Anne Schuchat: (34:13)
Anne Schuchat from the CDC, and we really appreciate the chance to hear everyone.
President Trump: (34:17)
Thank you.
Speaker 11 Louis?: (34:19)
Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, thank you for saving the most exciting company for the last. So we’re Novavax. We’re down the street in Maryland. We’re a vaccine company. We make recombinant nanoparticles. We make respiratory vaccines. We have two in phase three trials. We have an RSV vaccine where we vaccinated 4,600 pregnant women to protect infants from RSV disease and the youngest kids. We have a flu vaccine. We all know we need a better flu vaccine, and we have one in phase three trials we’re going to unblind in four weeks, exciting time for the company.
Speaker 11 Louis?: (34:55)
But we actually are a company that is focused on emerging infectious diseases. We’ve made two coronavirus vaccines. We’ve made one for SARS. We made one for MERS. We tested MERS all the way through animal challenge trials and showed 100% infection protection.
Speaker 11 Louis?: (35:10)
We have an Ebola vaccine that with the NIH showed in four different nonhuman primate studies that we had 100% protection at extremely low doses. And we’ve made a pandemic flu vaccine for H7N9 and others. And we’ve twice now taken from the gene sequence to the first in human studies done in 90 days and published it in the New England Journal. And we’re once again doing the same thing since the gene sequence was identified, I think it published on January 10th. We’ve taken our same recombinant nanoparticle platform and have been in animal studies for a couple of weeks. We expect data this week from one of them.
Speaker 1: (35:52)
And on this is on corona?
Speaker 11 Louis?: (35:54)
I’m sorry, on corona, yes. And we’re going into nonhuman primates this week with a coronavirus vaccine candidate.
President Trump: (36:01)
So what do you think in terms of timing? What do you think?
Speaker 11 Louis?: (36:05)
Timing is what you hear around the table with this. We can get into humans in the May-June timetable, and in a phase one study also, but we’ll have primate data.
President Trump: (36:14)
So those are unheard of speeds, I think, right? Pretty much. Well make it very easy for you, and we have to be very safe, but those are unheard of speeds. Go ahead, Louis.
Speaker 11 Louis?: (36:25)
No, and we’re trying to identify scale so that we can get to the billion unit scale, both where we have a vaccine antigen and we also have an adjuvant. And we put those together and you get the most promising result we think. And so we desperately need and have good relationships with the FDA and to work with the FDA to see where, instead of waiting 30 days to get to an IND, you get it in 10 days or 20, whatever the number is.
Speaker 11 Louis?: (36:56)
But there are a lot of things that we could do with the FDA. And frankly, we need money. We’re a biotech company. I am not one of the larger pharma companies, and so we need money to get scaled.
President Trump: (37:08)
You work with the other companies also?
Speaker 11 Louis?: (37:09)
We have worked with the other companies. In this particular instance, we have not yet, but can.
President Trump: (37:16)
Dr. Stephen Hahn, by the way, is the new head of the FDA for those of you that don’t know. And he’s one of the most respected people in the country, and this is the man we wanted, and this is the man we got. You didn’t know you were going to be hit with this your first month. You’ve been here for a couple of months and this was a pretty big. Debra, would you like to say something?
Debra: (37:37)
Well, thank you. It’s a privilege to be here. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. I think what was exciting to hear around the table is you have a potential for a bridge, a bridge between the therapeutics and monoclonals while we work on the vaccines. And I think that’s the most promising piece for the American people to know that there’s technology that can be used as an immediate bridge, and then as we work on the vaccines. I think making sure that we’ve tested all of the antivirals that you have in your …
Ambassador Birx : (38:03)
Making sure that we’ve tested all of the antivirals that you have in your collection against this particular virus. Do IC50s across the board. Many of you have antiviral medication, and I think just to assure the American people that we have tried using our innovators to actually screen all the current drugs for potential activity against this virus would be key. But I think this is very promising with this linkage that you put together in this room between monoclonal antibodies, therapeutics, and vaccines. It’s very encouraging.
President Trump: (38:32)
It is, very exciting, and the speed is very exciting, too. Anybody else have anything to say? Anybody at all?
Speaker 3: (38:39)
I’ve got something on the screening. So, we set up already an industry construction where everyone is now able to submit, biotech or pharmaceuticals, to submit to a screening, which is set up for everybody supported by Barda and supported by Europe.
President Trump: (38:55)
Yeah. That’s fantastic. You’ll move rapidly. Media, would you like to ask any questions of any of the geniuses around the table?
Speaker 4: (39:00)
Mr. President, what economic stimulus measures are you considering to boost the economy as a result of the virus?
President Trump: (39:05)
Well, I guess the market’s up today. Our country is very strong economically, as you know. This was something that came out of China that was a big surprise to the world. It happened just a few weeks ago. I’m sure the Fed is looking at it. I hope the Fed is looking at it. They should be, but a lot of these central banks are looking at it for stimulus.
President Trump: (39:27)
One thing I want to add, we keep talking about for America, but really we’re looking at for a cure for the whole world because this is a world cure, not just the United States. We want to take care of the United States, but whatever we do is going to inure it to the benefit of the world, so we want to do that. Fortunately, some of your companies are so large, you can handle that. But you work together, thereby making it even better, so we appreciate that. We would love to have you work together on this. Get it done and get it done safely and quickly.
President Trump: (39:56)
But I think, we’re in very strong shape, very strong shape financially. I have to tell you. I came into the room not expecting to hear quite what I’ve heard, but a lot of work has already been done. We’ve been encouraging them for the last few weeks. I mean literally from the first day, when we shut down the border, so to speak, we shut it down to China, something we didn’t like to do, but we made a good decision. But we also called some of the companies around the table, said, “Get going. Just in case, get going.” We’re very proud of the work that some of them have done. Some are very advanced already on this particular coronavirus, so we appreciate it. That’s tremendous news, and I think the speed is a lot greater than a lot of people would have thought.
Speaker 4: (40:40)
Do you see a need for federal dollars to go to some of these drug companies? I think two of the CEOs around the table-
President Trump: (40:45)
I don’t know. I think you’re so rich. I know the companies very well. Some of them are so rich, I think they can actually loan money to the federal government. They don’t need money. They need time. I think what they need more than anything else, Dan, you might tell me, but I think what you need is FDA and Tony have to help you get through the process as quickly as possible, the bureaucratic stuff and we don’t have bureaucrats here. We have people that really know how to get it done between Tony, and Bob, and Steven, they’ll get you folks through very, very quickly. [crosstalk 00:03:17].
Speaker 4: (41:20)
Do you think that they should have called an emergency meeting before the meeting in a couple of weeks that cooperates, is your administration-
President Trump: (41:27)
Well, I think they should have had a meeting already, so I think they should have, and the central banks are going to be talking about various things tomorrow, but we’ll see what happens. But I think they should have had a meeting already. I don’t know what takes them so long. [crosstalk 00:03:40]. I’ll see what happens. Let’s see what happens tomorrow.
Speaker 5: (41:48)
What would you say to Americans who are buying out all the hand sanitizers at CVS?
President Trump: (41:48)
Buying what?
Speaker 5: (41:48)
Buying out all the hand sanitizers at CVS, or stockpiling groceries and face masks. We’re concerned about a long term situation.
Speaker 6: (41:57)
Listen, as the President has said and we’ve said from the outset, we’re going to see more cases here in the United States, and we need to be prepared. We prepare for the worst case. We hope for the best case. Part of preparing is normal preparedness activities by individuals. Go to cdc.gov to get information about just sound preparedness at home like you would have for a hurricane or for the flu season. That’s the same type of activity now, so having some food, having some hand sanitizer, but frankly soap and water are good, a good soap and water hand washing for an appropriate amount of time. If you look@cdc.gov for guidance, is as effective as that kind of sanitizer, but people should not be panicked. They shouldn’t be. I know they may feel that. They may feel a sense of unease. They feel the uncertainty. We’re trying to reveal all information we have, but there are steps people could take like that, just good everyday prepared us. Nothing different today than I would have advised six months ago to people.
Speaker 7: (43:01)
Mr. President, are you considering tightening any of the travel regulations that you said-
President Trump: (43:05)
Yes, we are to certain countries where they have more of a breakout. We are. You know what those countries are. I don’t have to say, but we are doing that, and we’ve already done it, as you know, with three countries in addition to China. So, we will be doing it. Yes.
Speaker 8: (43:20)
Mr. President, you said supplementals here. What’s the [inaudible 00:05:24], and are you also considering a national emergency declaration that would allow states and local governments [inaudible 00:43:32]?
President Trump: (43:32)
I don’t think you’ll need that because I really think we’re in extremely good shape. We’re prepared for anything and we could always do that at a later date if we need it. But I don’t think we need that at this stage. Interestingly, we were discussing it. A question I get asked a lot by people is on average you lose from 26,000 to 70,000 or so and even some cases more from the flu. We have deaths of that per year, worldwide it’s hundreds of thousands of deaths from the common flu. They ask what’s the difference and how does this differ?
President Trump: (44:05)
I guess there are things that are similar and things that are different. Every one of them is different. It might not be a bad question to ask because I get that all the time. So far we have six here. You have in other countries, I mean China obviously got hit the hardest. I noticed that South Korea is hit very hard. Italy is being hit very hard. But I would like to maybe now, because I am often times asked. We average, I suspect, Tony, I think you said from around 26, 27,000 up to 60 or 70,000 deaths per year. That’s a lot of deaths. Here we’re talking about a much smaller range. Now, hopefully it stays at a much smaller range. Again, we’re prepared for anything. Could I ask you, or any of you, if you’d like to answer that question? What would the public think when you have so many? That’s taken routinely, and I was shocked to hear this. Three, four weeks ago I said, “Well, how many people die a year from the flu?” Of this country, I think last year was 36 or 37,000 people. I’m saying, “Wow, nobody knew that information worldwide.” You just multiply it out times the world, right? So, what is the difference then?
Speaker 9: (45:17)
Well, I think there are people around the table that probably are more medically qualified, but I mean, clearly when we’re bringing up represented around the table is the ability to prevent an endemic of sorts and the ability to treat. Those two things going together, I think, are really, really important as the best [inaudible 00:45:37] presented.
President Trump: (45:37)
We may have to up our research on the flu.
Speaker 9: (45:40)
Well, yeah, right.
President Trump: (45:41)
The common flu.
Speaker 9: (45:44)
We have treatments for the flu, and we have vaccinations for the flu, and we need to continue to improve upon.
President Trump: (45:47)
Doctor.
Speaker 9: (45:48)
We’ve actually taken on the challenge that you just mentioned. So, we are investing in what could be new technology to completely [inaudible 00:45:56] out from a flu, and you need to think about how you can move fast from the first cases to have the right type of vaccine, and how you can be able to manufacture it very fast, because I think you are right on to point that the numbers in flu are so large and we haven’t come to that level yet. But I think it’s also the fear that there is no experience yet with these survivors, and we don’t have the feeling of going to CVS and get the flu vaccine, or use some of the drugs. But I think you’ve summarized it very well. These are challenges we should take on year by year that [inaudible 00:46:34] and protect lives. [crosstalk 00:00:46:37].
President Trump: (46:36)
Including, Tony, that maybe we have to step up our work on the flu because when you lose that many people, that’s something.
Dr. Tony Fauci: (46:45)
Mr. President, What we’re doing is that we have a major effort to develop what we call the universal flu vaccine, namely a vaccine that you can give that would cover all the different strains so you don’t have to keep worrying about it mutating from year to year. So, that’s a major effort that we have.
President Trump: (47:03)
Because I notice every year they say a different vaccine, they have a little different, a little, and then you know, I hear numbers that are not great, 60%, 70% coverage success, and yet I hear numbers that are better than that with respect to corona. You think you can really knock it out and that’s because you know specifically what it is, I suspect, so that’s impressive. What do you think Lenny?
Speaker 10: (47:28)
I think one thing we can be sure and we’re going to be surprised about what happens over the next couple of months, and we’ve got to be prepared as you’re trying to do for every surprise that’ll come at us, because remember, maybe 100 million people, I was just checking, get vaccinated for the flu, even if there’s 60% protection. We have nobody in this country vaccinated for coronavirus right now, so that if it goes through the-
President Trump: (47:51)
But the same vaccine could not work. You take a solid flu vaccine, you don’t think that would have an impact or much of an impact on corona?
Speaker 10: (47:58)
No, probably none. So, that’s why you have a difference when you have a population that is totally naked to this virus. That’s why a vaccine approach getting out as quick as we can of course is paramount. The other thing is we have a group of people around this table, myself included, who are in an industry where optimism is an essential part of the toolkit, but realism is that 95% of what we all work on doesn’t go too far.
Speaker 10: (48:30)
So, that’s why it’s so important to have so many different approaches. We can’t-
President Trump: (48:35)
It seems to me just based on what you said and also what the other folks said from great companies, companies I know very well from just seeing what they do, and I find it very interesting. I have for a long time. It would seem to me that you already know pretty much where you’re going, and where you’re headed, and what the answer’s going to be. It would seem that, Steve. Doesn’t it seem? You seem to know what the answer is to this. You have to get it done, or is that too optimistic a statement?
Speaker 9: (49:02)
I think some of the new technologies that have come, that we heard today about [inaudible 00:49:08] MR 99, where you use completely new tools and technologies. They give us an opportunity to move fast, and that’s why some of the companies that have been working under the CDC can quickly change priorities and need huge public health threat.
Speaker 9: (49:24)
But, I think we should take on as a team to do something with seasonal flu, and actually I think, Robert Redfield, that has been one of your key priorities, and we have certainly picked up on that.
President Trump: (49:34)
By the way, it’d be a great thing if you could do that. Just aside from this meeting, if you could do that, that would be a great thing. Does anybody else have anything to say, please? Well, I want to just thank you all very much for being here and it’s a very optimistic meeting. I didn’t realize you were that far advanced and you’ll get together if you have to. You’ll deal with Tony and Bob, and you’ll deal with Steven and get it done. We need it. We want it fast. Okay? [crosstalk 00:12:02].
Speaker 11: (50:01)
Mr. President, do you expect that this will take longer, probably than you would like?
President Trump: (50:07)
I don’t know what the time will be. I don’t think they know what the time would be. I’ve heard very quick numbers, a matter of months, and I’ve heard pretty much a year would be an outside number. So, I think that’s not a bad range. But if you’re talking about three to four months in a couple of cases, and a year in other cases. Wouldn’t you say, doctor, would that be about right?
Speaker 11: (50:28)
Is it realistic to think, really, that a vaccine could be ready-
President Trump: (50:31)
Well, you have the greatest companies in the world sitting around the table. I mean, Johnson and Johnson, and Pfizer, and all of the companies, Gilead, you have all of these great companies and that’s what they’re saying. So, I think that-
Dr. Tony Fauci: (50:43)
Would you make sure you get the President the information that a vaccine that you make and start testing in a year is not a vaccine that’s deployable. So, he’s asking the question, when is it going to be deployable? That is going to be, at the earliest, a year to a year and a half, no matter how fast you go. Do you think that’s right? [Crosstalk 00:51:02].
President Trump: (51:03)
Well, I think treatment, in many ways, it might be more exciting.
Speaker 12: (51:10)
Yeah. That’s what I think. Ambassador Birx, I think, laid out a really nice framework as we think about managing expectations, which is be thinking antiviral therapeutics, transitioning to monoclonal antibodies, and eventually to vaccines, as we think about the continuum of research and development here. Is that fair for [inaudible 00:51:32]?
President Trump: (51:34)
Well, I think, Tony, I think that’s interesting because the concept of treatment in a certain way, especially when you have people that are looking for treatment, they’re beyond the vaccine stage. That would be very exciting.
Dr. Tony Fauci: (51:46)
It always goes faster than vaccine because you’re dealing with someone who’s already sick. The safety issues are going to be much, much different, and you will know your result almost immediately, whereas with vaccines it takes-
President Trump: (51:58)
So, then what would be your timing for treatment therapeutics, commonly known as, I call it, what would be your number?
Speaker 13: (52:08)
For us, we can think about producing 20,000 doses by the end of the summer of a course of treatment, and as Doctor Fauci said, you’re going to find out very quickly. It’s not going to be a mystery whether these things work or not. We’re pretty confident that ours is the monoclonal antibody approach. We think that that approach has a very high probability in the near term of delivering.
President Trump: (52:33)
So, treatment, I mean just for the media, so the treatment element of it goes faster than the vaccine element of it, which in my opinion in this case would be better. Go ahead, please sir.
Speaker 14: (52:44)
Mr. President, I mean, [inaudible 00:52:46] our medicine is in phase three trials right now and these trials are conducted very fast. I mean, we’re talking about 30 day endpoints, so you recruit them, you know in 30 days, once you recruit, whether it works or not. Thankfully, so far the drug seems to be very safe, but we have to determine is its level of efficacy, it’s clinical effectiveness, and that as I said, we’ll know potentially as early as April.
President Trump: (53:07)
So, it could be used as a treatment. Somebody is sick, they have the problem, Tony, when do you think it could be used?
Dr. Tony Fauci: (53:13)
Is well, if the trial that Daniel was talking about proves efficacy, which you likely might know in a few months whether it’s effective or not, if you know by June that it’s effective, then you just scale up and manufacture it and you’re good to go.
President Trump: (53:30)
How good is that? You hear that, Jeff? That’s good even by your standpoint, Jeff.
Speaker 6: (53:35)
Well, let me give you an example, for instance, with the Regeneron product with Ebola. So, Tony Fauci and his team, and the World Health Organization ran a historic forearm clinical trial in the war zone in eastern Congo, and two of the products, one of them developed by NIAID, and the other [crosstalk 00:53:55] one developed by Regeneron proved so effective that the ethical board said stop on the other two. I’m sorry, yeah. [crosstalk 00:54:03] They said, and start treating, and when I went to the Congo, I got to see people that even before FDA approval are being treated still in the extension of this clinical trial, and being cured of Ebola now, walking out where they would have had a death sentence before. That’s what we would try to do.
Speaker 15: (54:22)
So, for us, that’s an end of the summer type of an event.
Speaker 6: (54:23)
That’s what we would try to do.
President Trump: (54:27)
He just got back from the Congo and that’s dedication. That was not an easy trip, wasn’t it?
Speaker 15: (54:33)
I mean, it wasn’t easy to do that trail there, but kudos to Tony.
President Trump: (54:38)
I want to thank everybody in this room. Mike, go ahead.
Vice President Pence: (54:41)
I was about to do the same as the President, just pledge that our whole task force, this whole team, HHS, I know CDC, President and I will be at NIH tomorrow, look forward to working with all of you, and I want to commend each and every one of you for responding to the President’s call for action. This is all hands on deck and the news out of this meeting that you’ve already formed a consortium. We know we have the greatest pharmaceutical industry in the world, in the United States, Mr. President, now we know they will be working together to create therapeutics and ultimately a new vaccine to deal with the coronavirus.
President Trump: (55:14)
That’s fantastic.
Vice President Pence: (55:15)
I want to thank you all.
President Trump: (55:16)
Anybody delays you, please call me. They don’t just call Tony and Bob.
Speaker 16: (55:21)
The DOW jumped 1300 points today.
President Trump: (55:25)
1300?
Speaker 16: (55:26)
Yeah, 1293, 5%.
President Trump: (55:28)
They must have heard about this meeting. Who’s talking outside? This is very optimistic. I know optimism, and not optimism, and the worst pessimism, and I will tell you, the whole thing with therapeutics to me is very exciting, and obviously vaccine, but therapeutics is very exciting, especially when you’re so far advanced. That’s great. That’s really great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Say hello to everybody. [crosstalk 00:55:54] [inaudible 00:56:00]"
"Mar 2, 2020",Uknown,"President Trump: (00:00)
We have a rally scheduled and that should be I think terrific. It’s thousands of people who are already out there waiting, so we’re going to have hopefully a good time. We’re going to make a lot of different predictions tonight also.
President Trump: (00:14)
Working very hard with the CDC, with everybody on a subject that has become a very big subject. Our country is doing very well. Our professionals are doing really an incredible job. We’re also working with other countries to help them because they really have a fear of the unknown. We’re working very much with a lot of other countries including Columbia, but we’re working with a lot of other countries on helping them with respect to this problem. And again, we’re doing very well. Some additional people were reported. They’re in good shape, but we have some additional people that were reported and not very many in the United States, so we will be having a news conference later.
President Trump: (01:00)
I’m also meeting with the pharmaceutical companies later on this afternoon. We have a big meeting with the biggest companies, really the most powerful companies, hopefully the smartest companies anywhere in the world. When it comes to drugs and vaccines, because we’re talking about a vaccine, maybe a cure. It’s possible. So we’ll see about that. But we’re talking about a vaccine and they’re moving along very quickly. All of the pharmaceutical companies are moving along very quickly, but you’ll be invited to a part of that meeting. So we’ll see you a little bit later on in the afternoon and thank you all very much. Thank you.
Speaker 2: (01:32)
[crosstalk 00:01:38].
President Trump: (01:39)
Well, you’re going to have to spray. If you don’t spray, you’re not going to get rid of them. So you have to spray with regard to the drugs in Colombia. Yeah.
Speaker 3: (01:46)
Let me… something that is very important and we have to combine all the elements that we have. Obviously, precision spraying but also are record heights that we reach in 2019 on manual eradication and also dismantling the drug cartels. So we have to work on all the elements and we have to be very strong against that crime. That crime is hurting our people and it’s hurting people everywhere and we need to work jointly in that effort as we have been doing so far.
Speaker 4: (02:12)
What’s the next steps for Venezuela?
President Trump: (02:13)
We’re talking about Venezuela. One of the things we’re talking about is Venezuela. A big subject for us and they’re treating the people of Venezuela unbelievably badly. They don’t have water, they don’t have food, they don’t have anything. And we are talking about that. That’s a big topic of discussion yesterday.
Speaker 3: (02:33)
Mr. President, if I may add something, it’s very important that we are stronger on sanctions against the dictatorship in Venezuela. Venezuela is running out of [inaudible 00:02:43]. They have destroyed all their healthcare system, so we have to in this year work together, join me. So there’s a political and democratic transition that is effective in Venezuela.
Speaker 5: (02:54)
What do want to hear from pharmaceutical [inaudible 00:03:00] in Mexico?
President Trump: (03:00)
We said that before and that was about drug pricing. This meeting was set up a long time ago with the pharmaceutical companies and that meeting was about drug pricing because we brought the numbers down last year, first time in 51 years that the drug prices prescription have come down. And I have a meeting scheduled on drug prices, but now we’re going to make another subject and that’ll be probably the first subject and that is to do with the vaccine and how are they doing?
Speaker 5: (03:26)
Is it possible [inaudible 00:03:23].
President Trump: (03:26)
That’s what we’re going to find out. We’ll know that. Well, we’ve asked them to accelerate whatever they’re doing in terms of a vaccine. Absolutely.
Speaker 6: (03:34)
Mr. President, is it safe or appropriate to be holding rallies during a public health crisis like this?
President Trump: (03:38)
These were set up a long time ago and others are. I mean, you could ask that to the Democrats because they are having a lot of rallies. They’re all having rallies. That’s what they’re doing. They’re campaigning.
Speaker 6: (03:48)
But do you think it’s safe? Are you worried at all?
President Trump: (03:50)
I think it’s very safe. Yeah. I think it’s safe.
Speaker 7: (03:56)
Mr. President, do think the interactive talks are going to actually start as planned-
President Trump: (04:02)
Well, we’re going to find out, but we’re getting out. We want to get out. We had good meetings with the Taliban and we are going to be leaving. And we’re going to be bringing our soldiers back home. We’d been there for almost 20 years. It’s a long time. We’ve done a great job in terms of getting rid of terrorists. Now it’s up to other countries to get rid of those terrorists.
Speaker 7: (04:23)
What if the [inaudible 00:04:24] again?
President Trump: (04:25)
We have discussions to go, but we’ve made a lot of progress. Okay? Thank you. Thank you all very much. [crosstalk 00:04:43]."
"Feb 25, 2020",11:11 A.M. EST,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Thank you very much, please. So we had a couple of really great days in India. Prime Minister Modi is a terrific man. He’s a terrific leader. And we have a lot of things going in terms of product being purchased by India. We just had a meeting. A lot of the press was there. I thought it was a great meeting with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. They come from India, they’re agreeing to invest billions and billions of dollars. You heard it for yourself. They’re going to be investing billions of dollars in our country. That was the purpose of the trip. Also, we’re all set for $3 billion worth of helicopters, the Apaches and various other types in addition to other equipment. They’re buying that, and they’re buying a lot. They’re going to be buying a lot, and they’re also going to be buying a lot of our energy, all forms of our energy, because they need energy.
Donald Trump: (00:56)
And we have more than anybody. We’re number one in the world now in energy. So that’s going to be very exciting. But I thought it was a great two days, was a fantastic two days. I’m going to be not at all controversial, because I don’t want to blow the two days plus two days of travel on one answer, one little answer, little answer. Like John will ask me one little simple question, and you’ll blow it out. And that will be the end of the trip. They won’t even talk about the trip. I’ll be very, very conservative in my answers if you don’t mind. But we did. We had a great time. We had great meetings and we’re going for a state dinner. And then after that we get back onto the plane and we go back home. It’s going to be about 19 hours, but we look forward to it, get in tomorrow.
Donald Trump: (01:42)
But this is a tremendous country. It’s 1.4 billion, probably at least the most people. And it’s a tremendous market and they really like us. And I think they like us more now than they’ve ever liked us, frankly. We have a terrific, a really great relationship between the prime minister and myself. So we’re going to be doing a lot of things. I think it was really, really worth it. You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it. And the people that have it are in all cases, I have not heard anything other, maybe there’s something new because for two days I haven’t been seeing too much of that news, very much news because it’s been very all encompassing. We’ve accomplished a lot. We had a lot of meetings as you know. But the people are getting better, they’re all getting better.
Donald Trump: (02:39)
We brought in some Americans from a ship, because it was really the right thing to do. And they’re in quarantine. And we think they’ll be in very good shape very, very soon. We discussed a lot of different elements. We actually discussed the coronavirus, and at this moment India doesn’t have much of a problem, they feel. It wasn’t expressed that they did, which is great. And I think that whole situation will start working out. A lot of talent, a lot of brain power is being put behind it. Two and a half billion dollars we’re putting in. I see that Chuck Schumer criticized that. He thought it should be more. And if I gave more, he’d say it should be less, automatic with these characters. They’re just not good for our country. If I gave more, he’d say it should be less.
Donald Trump: (03:35)
But that’s what they do in the meantime. That’s all they can do. They’re not getting anything done. We have so many things we could get done. We could so easily do prescription drug. Last year was the first year in 51 years where prescription drug prices went down. But we could drive them down really well if we had the Democrat votes. We need some additional votes. We would really drive them down, as you know. So with that, I think what we’ll do is take some questions and we’ll go to a nice state dinner and then we go home. Yeah. John, go ahead.
John: (04:08)
Mr. President, you just addressed coronavirus, so I will put that aside for the moment. You tweeted about Justice Sotomayor yesterday, saying that she and Justice Ginsburg should recuse themselves from future cases dealing with the administration. What is the basis for your opinion on that?
Donald Trump: (04:27)
It’s very obvious. I always thought frankly that Justice Ginsburg should do it because she went, while during the campaign when I was running, I don’t know who she was for. Perhaps she was for Hillary Clinton, if you can believe it. But she said some things that were obviously very inappropriate. She later sort of apologized. I wouldn’t say it was an apology, but she sort of apologized. And then Justice Sotomayor said what she said yesterday, you know very well what she said yesterday. It was a big story. And I just don’t know how they can not recuse themselves for anything having to do with Trump or Trump related.
Donald Trump: (05:06)
The right thing to do is that now as a Supreme Court Justice there’s a different standard. But at the same time I think it’s a higher standard in a certain sense. So they’ll have to decide what to do. But her statement was so inappropriate when you’re a justice of the Supreme Court and it’s almost what she’s trying to do is take the people that do feel a different way, and get them to vote the way that she would like them to vote. I just thought it was so inappropriate. Such a terrible statement for a Supreme Court justice.
John: (05:34)
What was inappropriate about the statement? I’m not an attorney so I can’t really look into it.
Donald Trump: (05:39)
You know what the statement was, John.
John: (05:40)
She seemed to criticize the White House for running to the Supreme Court at the drop of a hat to seek [crosstalk 00:00:05:46].
Donald Trump: (05:45)
No, I don’t think that was it. But I think what she did say is she’s trying to shame the way I look at it. She’s trying to shame people with perhaps a different view into voting her way. And that’s so inappropriate. So let’s see what happens. We have things, whether or not they recuse themselves both. Look, Justice Ginsburg during my campaign, I protested at the time, she apologized in a very minor form. And what Justice Sotomayor said yesterday was really highly inappropriate. And everybody agrees to that, virtually everybody I’ve seen. I’ve seen papers on it. People cannot believe that she said it. Yeah, please. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: (06:28)
Thank you, Mr. President. The intelligence community believes that Russia is trying to meddle in the 2020 election. Do you agree with their assessment, and what is your message to Vladimir Putin about potentially interfering, regardless of the candidate they support?
Donald Trump: (06:44)
You know what, I’m reading, and again, I’m over here for the last number of days. But they went to see Bernie and they told Bernie about something having to do with, they want Bernie to win. They did not tell me. Intelligence never told me. And we have a couple of people here that would know very well. They never told me anything about that. And it was a strange thing that they went to Bernie. And now I find out, if I believe what I read in some of your documents, in some of your papers that it was highly exaggerated. And frankly I think it’s disgraceful. And I think it was leaks from the intelligence committee, House version. And I think that they leaked it. I think probably Schiff leaked it, but some people within that… Schiff leaked it, in my opinion.
Donald Trump: (07:32)
And he shouldn’t be leaking things like that. That’s a terrible thing to do. But basically they would like to see Bernie as probably winning. And looks like he’s winning and he’s got a head of steam. And they maybe don’t want him for obvious reasons, so they don’t want him. So they put out a thing that rushes back in him. This is what they do. I’ve gone through it for a long time, I get it. I get the game better than anybody. And that’s the way it is. Terrible thing to say. And they didn’t say it about me. I will say this, somebody leaked it in intelligence, but nobody ever told me that. We have Ambassador O’Brien in the audience someplace. And he can tell you that this was never discussed with us, so I think it’s terrible. They ought to stop the leaking from intelligence committee. And if they don’t stop it, I can’t imagine that people are not going to go after them and find out what’s happening.
Speaker 1: (08:24)
But do you believe-
Donald Trump: (08:25)
Go ahead ma’am.
Speaker 2: (08:29)
Mr. President, this is [inaudible 00:08:32] from Indian TV news, [inaudible 00:08:33] News. You’re trying to get a peace agreement [crosstalk 00:08:35]
Speaker 3: (08:34)
Med TV agency. [inaudible 00:08:37].
Speaker 2: (08:37)
-Afghanistan. So the way the deal is being worked out, what would be India’s role and Pakistan’s role in the region?
Donald Trump: (08:44)
I think India would like to see it happen. I spoke with Prime Minister Modi today and I think they would very much like to see it happen. And we’re pretty close, we’ll see what’s going on. We’ve got two days now under our belt without violence or I guess a minimum of violence. And we’ll see what happens, but people want to see it. It’s very interesting that one, is everybody’s happy about it. Even people that are normally against me 99.9% of the time, because we’ve been there for 19 years and everybody would like to see it happen. I was actually surprised. I thought the Schumers of the world would say whatever the opposite is. Because that’s all they can do, crying Chuck. But people are really happy to see that we’re trying very hard. It would bring it down to 8,600. And from there we’ll make a decision as to what the final outcome would be.
Donald Trump: (09:39)
But there’s been tremendous praise for the fact that we’re doing something. Other administrations have tried to do something, in particular, the previous administration for a long time. They were never able to get anything done. And we’re really serving not as a military force as we are a police force. And we’re not a police force. They have to police their own country. We’re not a police force. It’s like law enforcement and that’s the way it is. So we’d like to, I can tell you after 19 years, we’d like to bring our young people back home. That’s where they want to be, and we’ll always have intelligence there. We’ll have other things there, but for the most part, we would like to bring them back home.
Donald Trump: (10:22)
We want to watch the area. The area is a hotbed of problems. And when we bring them home, we’ll let them know that if something happens, we will hit them so hard. And we could win that easily if I wanted to kill millions of people. I don’t want to kill millions of people, innocent people. We could win that very easily. We don’t have to act as a police force. We could act as a military force to win, not a military force to just take care of things in that very, very difficult part of the world. It’s a very difficult part, very dangerous part of the world. So let’s see what happens. So far, so good. So far, but I’m very impressed with the kind of kudos we’re getting. Yes, please.
Speaker 4: (11:03)
Mr. President, namaste. I’m Saurabh Shukla, editor in chief of News Mobile. If you remember, I interviewed you during your last campaign in New Jersey. And I asked you this question earlier at that time about a Trump doctrine on fighting out Islamic fundamentalism, which you spoke about and you discussed with Prime Minister Modi. And you spoke about a Modi Trump doctrine. So what is your roadmap to fight out Islamic radical terrorism?
Donald Trump: (11:34)
I don’t think anybody’s done more than I have. If you look, because I came in and if you check your maps and look at Iraq and Syria, it was all over. In fact, they had it painted a certain color. I won’t tell you what color, because it doesn’t matter. Somebody will say it was a Republican color, so I don’t want to get people confused. But it happened to be red. And it was basically trying to show where ISIS was in those areas, and it was out of control. And I gave the orders, and we have 100% of the caliphate. We have tens of thousands of people in prisons now. They’re being guarded by the Kurds and others. Europe should take a lot of them back. So far they haven’t agreed to do that. They should do that because we did them a big favor.
Donald Trump: (12:22)
We captured them, but I did that. We killed al-Baghdadi a few months ago and Soleimani is gone. He’s no longer putting roadside bombs all over the place. Somebody else may be, but he was the father, the king of the roadside bomb. All of those young people that you see with missing legs and missing legs and arms. I’ve seen every combination. The legs are gone. You go over to Walter Reed, I have to say the doctors at Walter Reed are incredible. What they’re able to do, incredible. But that’s what his thing was. He thought that was a beautiful weapon. Roadside bombs. It’s a coward’s bomb, and all of these young people that have been so badly hurt. And we did a big favor. In addition to that, as you know, Hamza bin Laden is now gone. He was looking to do damage and he’s gone. And al-Qaeda last week, you saw what happened there.
Donald Trump: (13:24)
So nobody has done more than what I’ve done. but at the same time, Russia should do it, Iran should do it, Iraq should do it. Syria should do it. We’re in a different part of the world. We’re doing it. Everybody says you’re the only ones that can do it. At some point these other countries, Iran should do it. Iran hates ISIS and they should do it. And we’ve done a great job. We’ve taken our soldiers essentially out of Syria except for little hotspots that we’ll do that develop. But we’ve taken the oil and the soldiers we have, they’re the ones guarding the oil. We have the oil. So that’s all we have there. If you look, we are down to a small force in Iraq. And we’re down to a small force very shortly. But right now even we have a small force in Afghanistan, and so we’re moving out and moving around. But the only soldiers we have in terms of Syria, the predominant number of soldiers are the ones guarding the oil.
Speaker 4: (14:28)
What about terror groups in Pakistan? That’s a big concern in this region. There are lot of terror groups who pose dangers to the United States and democracies like India as well.
Donald Trump: (14:38)
I agree. But you also have other countries that can do this. The United States is 8,000 miles away. And they’re all saying, could you do it? Yeah, we could do it. We’ve been doing it for a long time, but I’ve been doing it much better than anyone else has done it. What we’ve done in the last couple of years has been incredible. We have 100% of the caliphate. Remember we had 99% I’d say, good, we’re leaving. And I was hit with, people couldn’t believe it. They said do 100, so we did 100. I did 100 with some great generals that knew exactly what they were doing. They were unbelievable. We took 100% of the caliphate. And we have thousands of prisoners right now locked up. And these are ISIS fighters and killed thousands. Not that I want to do that, I don’t want to do that. But that’s what we had to do. And when I came in, ISIS was all over the place. It was totally out of control. Please, thank you.
Speaker 5: (15:35)
While you’ve been here in the country, in the capital in the northeast part of Delhi, there have been violent clashes. Police have been killed, some demonstrators, nine deaths so far, we hear, and about 100 plus injured. What did Prime Minister Modi say to you about this amended citizenship law, and how concerned are you about this kind of religious violence?
Donald Trump: (16:01)
So we did talk about religious freedom and-
Speaker 6: (16:03)
– have religious violence [crosstalk 00:00:01].
Donald Trump: (16:03)
We did talk about religious freedom, and I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom and very strongly, and he said that in India, they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom. And if you look back and look at what’s going on relative to other places especially, but they have really worked hard on religious freedom. I asked that question in front of a very large group of people today, and he talked about it. We talked about it for a long time, and I really believe that’s what he wants. As far as the individual attack, I heard about it, but I didn’t discuss that with him. That’s up to India. Yeah. Go ahead, please.
Emily Goodman: (16:44)
Hi sir. Emily Goodman with the daily mail.com I was wondering, do you think justice was served in the Harvey Weinstein case?
Donald Trump: (16:51)
I was never a fan of Harvey Weinstein, as you know. In fact, he said he was going to work hard to defeat me in the election. How did that work out, by the way? I’m trying to figure that out. He was a person I didn’t like, never liked. I don’t know too much about the case, because as you know, I’ve been over here. Between traveling and being at meetings almost every hour of the day, every minute of the day, I haven’t been able to really see too much of it, but I was just not a fan of his. I knew him a little bit. Not very well. I knew him because he was in New York. Not a person that I like. I will say the people that liked them were the Democrats. Michelle Obama loved him. Loved him. Hillary Clinton loved him. And he gave tremendous money to the Democrats, and I guess my question is, will the Democrats be asking for that money back? Because he gave a lot of money to the Democrats, and it’s too bad, but that’s the way it worked out. Yeah, Peter?
Peter: (17:50)
I just want to follow up on that very quickly, if I can, Mr. President, then I have a question that I wanted to ask you. But just on the Harvey Weinstein situation, this is being viewed as a milestone for the Me Too movement. What message can you as President deliver to women in America who are still afraid to come forward and share their stories of sexual harassment and assault?
Donald Trump: (18:09)
Well, again, I don’t know the actual results. I haven’t seen too much, because I’ve been in India as you know.
Peter: (18:14)
Aside from this case.
Donald Trump: (18:15)
I think that from the standpoint of women, I think it was a great thing. It was a great victory and sends a very strong message. A very, very strong message, Peter. Yeah, please.
Peter: (18:28)
Can I follow up with my question? I just wanted to follow up on hers quickly. On Coronavirus specifically, Mr. President, 2014 when the Ebola situation was very concerning to so many Americans, you tweeted, “Ebola patient will be brought to the US in a few days. Now I know for sure that our leaders are incompetent.” In all caps, he wrote, “Keep them out of here.” More than 20 Americans have now been brought back to the United States with Coronavirus. By your own measure, does that mean that your government has been incompetent? Are you pleased with the response?
Donald Trump: (18:56)
No, no. There’s a big difference, in case you don’t know, between Ebola and Coronavirus. Big, big difference. It’s like day and night, and I felt that we should bring them back. They’re Americans. We should bring them back. With Ebola, it’s very explosive. It’s very terrible. We’re making tremendous strides on Ebola with the things that we’re doing, as you know. People are living with-
Speaker 6: (19:16)
Isn’t some of the money that you’re requesting… Sorry. Please.
Donald Trump: (19:19)
Let me answer the question. But there’s a tremendous, there’s a vast difference than [inaudible 00:00:19:23], especially in around ’14. Was that ’14 or ’12? And at that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola or ever conceived of something where you basically… People would disintegrate, and we’re still working on Ebola. We’re doing the vaccines.
Speaker 6: (19:43)
To be clear, all those brought here survived though, right?
Donald Trump: (19:44)
Excuse me. Yeah, we’re doing a vaccine. We’re doing a lot of things having to do with Ebola. We’re not forgetting about Ebola. That’s a horrible thing. But we have that now very much under control, other than certain parts of the Congo where they are having war and we can’t get in, so we’re still working on that. But as far as what we’re doing with the new virus, I think that we’re doing a great job. I felt that, and the decision was made in Japan, let these Americans come back and we’ll see where they are, but they were immediately put into quarantine. There’s no problem with it whatsoever. They’re all in quarantine. And as you know, I approved two and a half billion dollars for just that purpose and also for working on getting a vaccine.
Speaker 6: (20:29)
For clarity, those with Ebola, when they were brought here were quarantined and all the Americans also survived, right?
Donald Trump: (20:35)
The level of death with Ebola, at the time it was a virtual 100 percent.
Speaker 6: (20:40)
But none of the Americans who came here.
Donald Trump: (20:41)
There’s a very good chance you’re not going to die. It’s very much the opposite. You’re talking about one or 2 percent, whereas in the other case, it was a virtual 100 percent. Now they have studied it. They know very much. In fact, we’re very close to a vaccine. Yeah, please go ahead. Go ahead, Peter. Oh, all right. [crosstalk 00:21:03]
Swathi Chandrashekar: (21:04)
Hi, I’m Swathi Chandrashekar from TV5 Network.
Donald Trump: (21:07)
Thank you.
Swathi Chandrashekar: (21:08)
How do you define, differentiate, and deal with the love of yours for Indians in India, and Indians love for H-1B visa in America? How do you differentiate this?
Donald Trump: (21:23)
Yeah, we’re talking about the H-1Bs, and look, the relationship we have, this is not from me. This is from almost everybody that saw it. They say the history of India, which has a long history and a brilliant history in so many different ways, there’s never been a reception given to somebody like was given, and I would like to say for the United States of America. But nobody else that came here got the kind of reception we got. It was 125,000, I think, seats they had yesterday. They were full. You had thousands and thousands of people outside. Prime Minister Modi was telling me thousands of people outside. That’s not uncommon for me, to be honest with you, but when I look at 125,000 seats… And that was an incredible scene yesterday. In addition, all of those people lined up from the airport to the event. It was an incredible thing. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.
Donald Trump: (22:14)
The ambassador just told me that he’s been in India for a long time. In fact, both ambassadors, their ambassador and the ambassador from India said in 40 years, he’s never seen anything like it, what took place yesterday and earlier than that. But yesterday, they’ve never seen anything like it, so it was a great compliment. It was a great compliment to our country. I’m the leader of the country, but it was a great compliment to our country. But Prime Minister Modi said today they’ve never, ever had any event like that. In fact, they said usually when somebody comes in, they have to look for people to fill up the areas. There was something very special. Look, it’s a massive country in terms of its population, and people just wanted to see. They wanted to pay their respect to the United States, and so I appreciate it. I was a recipient, in a sense, but I was just really representing the country. Yeah, Peter? Yeah?
Speaker 7: (23:12)
[inaudible 00:23:14].
Peter: (23:16)
Thank you. Sorry. Thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (23:18)
Go ahead.
Peter: (23:19)
Mr. President, your newly installed personnel director has begun talking with agencies about finding people in the government that are not loyal to you and perhaps moving them on. How large a list do you imagine this will be? Is this a big problem in your mind? Can you describe for us the scale of the problem as you see it?
Donald Trump: (23:37)
Yeah, I don’t think it’s a big problem. I don’t think it’s very many people. I think we had a whistleblower who was a fake, because if you look at the whistleblower as an example, if you look at his report and then you compare that to the transcripts, it bore no relationship. That was a very sad situation and a lot of time, a lot of time wasted. Although as you will admit, in fact you wrote very nicely, I appreciate it, the poll numbers have gone up very much, but that’s not appropriate to have to benefit by something like that. Then there was supposed to be a second whistleblower. As soon as I released the transcripts, the second whistleblower was gone. Nobody ever heard what happened to the second whistleblower. I’ll ask you. Where is he? Remember, the second was he or she.
Donald Trump: (24:20)
The second whistleblower was going to happen. It was just a matter of moments. And then I released the real call, the transcripts, which are now 100 percent accurate, even according to Lieutenant Colonel Veneman. Now, we want to have people that are good for the country, are loyal to our country, because that was a disgraceful situation. Please [inaudible 00:24:42].
Speaker 8: (24:45)
Mr. President, I am [inaudible 00:24:47]. I am from [inaudible 00:24:48] Television. It’s a parliamentary channel of India, upper house [inaudible 00:00:24:52].
Donald Trump: (24:52)
Good.
Speaker 8: (24:53)
You know, India’s concern is [inaudible 00:24:56] neighborhood, and even Prime Minister Modi tell that you are very good friends. What are your strategy about terrorism that is coming out from Pakistan to India? Because we had been suffering from this type of terrorism for last 20 years or so. What are your strategy? What are we going to do?
Donald Trump: (25:12)
We talked a lot about Pakistan. I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan. Very good. We talked about it today at length actually, and Prime Minister Modi, and it’s no question it’s a problem, but it’s a problem they have. They’re working on it. India is, it’s a brave nation too. There’s no pull-back from India, and we just hope. And I said I’ll help. I’ll do whatever I have to do, if I can do that, because my relationship with both gentlemen is so good. But there has been difficulty in Pakistan, and we’re seeing what we can do about it. Anything I can do to mediate, anything I can do to help, I would do.
Donald Trump: (25:54)
They’re working on Kashmir. Kashmir has been a thorn in a lot of people’s sides for a long time, and there are two sides to every story, but they’ve been working on that very hard. We discussed it at great length, terrorism, and I think we have some very good ideas. He’s very, very struggling against terrorism. I’ll tell you, Prime Minister Modi, he’s a very religious man, as you know. He’s a very calm man, but he’s actually a very, very strong person. Very tough, actually, when I’ve seen him in action, and he’s got that foremost in his mind, terrorism. He’ll take care of it.
Speaker 9: (26:31)
[inaudible 00:10:32].
Speaker 10: (26:31)
[inaudible 00:26:32].
Donald Trump: (26:36)
Please. Go ahead. You. Right here. That’s fine. Right there.
Speaker 11: (26:43)
Mr. President, thank you. [inaudible 00:26:45] have been invading for far too long. I’m [inaudible 00:26:48] from Business Line, and we would like to take you to your today’s meetings. Before coming to India, you said [inaudible 00:26:55] will be later, but of course sometime soon. In the morning, you spoke about energy security and energy deal, and you are already the fifth supplier to our country. You said other sources also. We would like you to elaborate on that. When we are talking energy security and energy deal, what are we looking at, and is nuclear happening?
Donald Trump: (27:17)
We talked about many things, many, many things. We talked about Iran, we talked about Iraq, we talked about… We were together for two days. I’m going to be with Prime Minister Modi tonight for a state dinner at 7:00. It starts at 7:00, I believe. And we talked about exactly all of the things that you’re talking about. We also talked about tariffs, because as you know, India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world, meaning charging tariffs to outsiders, and I said we have to stop that. We have to stop, at least as it pertains to the United States, and I think we’re understanding each other. With China, we worked a deal, and we worked it because of the tariffs. And I was able to leave the tariffs on. That will take care of phase two. We still have 25 percent and $250 billion, but in the meantime, we’re working with China very much on the virus. We feel that’s something.
Donald Trump: (28:12)
And I have to tell, I spoke to President Xi the other day. He is so committed to solving that problem. He is working very hard. He is very capable. The country is very capable. And it snuck up on him, but I think he’s going to do well. Now you see it’s going to South Korea, just going to Italy, and it’s going to other places. But I spoke to all of them. They’re all working very, very hard on it. The United States, because of an early decision I made, I made a decision… I believe it was the first time it’s ever been done. We closed the country to certain areas, as you know, and I was criticized for that decision. Now they’re saying it was a good decision.
Donald Trump: (28:58)
I think it was a good decision, because we have very few people, and you can add to it a few people that we took in because they were Americans. I mean, what are we going to do? And they were almost in-between countries where people weren’t going to take them and they were Americans, but they’re fully quarantined. They call it fully quarantined. We did the right thing. If you were out there, if you were an American and you refused to have any help from your country, these were wonderful people. It wasn’t their fault. But we’re really down to probably 10. Most of the people are outside of danger right now. But we’ve had a very strict line on the people that we’re taking the areas from which we take, and I did it very early. It’s never done before, and I did it early. I think it was a good decision as it turned out. Yeah, please.
Speaker 12: (29:52)
Just wanted to follow up on my colleague’s question about Russian interference. Can you pledge to the American people that you will not accept any foreign assistance in the upcoming election? And on this idea of a purge in your administration, there was recently the departure of your acting DNI, Joseph McGuire. You replaced him with your Ambassador to Germany, Rick Grenell. Some of your critics have pointed out that Ambassador Grinnell has no intelligence experience. How can you justify to the American people having an acting DNI with no intelligence experience?
Donald Trump: (30:25)
Okay, first of all, I want no help from any country, and I haven’t been given help from any country. And if you see what CNN, your wonderful network said, I guess they apologized in a way for… Didn’t they apologize for the fact that they said certain things that weren’t true? Tell me, what was their apology yesterday? What did they say?
Speaker 12: (30:48)
Mr. President, I think our record on delivering the truth is a lot better than yours sometimes, if you don’t mind me saying.
Donald Trump: (30:54)
Let me tell you about your record. Your record is so bad you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You have probably the worst record-
Swathi Chandrashekar: (30:58)
I’m not ashamed of anything in our organization [crosstalk 00:30:59], sir.
Donald Trump: (30:59)
You probably have the worst record in the history of broadcasting. As far as McGuire is concerned, he’s a terrific guy. But you know, on March 11th his time ended anyway, so his time came up. We would have had to, by statute, we would’ve had to change him anyways, so the time was [crosstalk 00:31:16].
Swathi Chandrashekar: (31:16)
Will your new DNI have experience in the intelligence field?
Donald Trump: (31:19)
I think yes, yes. In fact, we’re talking to five different people right now. I think all people that you know, all people that you respect, and I’ll make a decision probably over the next week to two weeks. We have some very good people. But Joe McGuire is a very excellent guy. He’s a very good man, and his time was March 11th. I believe it was March 11th where he would have had to leave. But we are going-
Swathi Chandrashekar: (31:40)
Was he forced out because he wasn’t sufficiently loyal to you?
Donald Trump: (31:42)
No, not at all. Not at all. He was pushed out because frankly… He wasn’t pushed out. He would’ve had to get out. On March 11th, he would’ve had to leave, but we’re going to be making a decision on DNI very shortly.
Swathi Chandrashekar: (31:52)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (31:53)
Yeah, please. Go ahead, please. Yeah.
Speaker 13: (31:57)
[inaudible 00:16: 01].
Donald Trump: (32:02)
Well, that’s not nice.
Speaker 14: (32:03)
Mr. President-
Donald Trump: (32:03)
Well, that’s not nice. Let her do it.
Speaker 14: (32:04)
Let’s go one by-
Donald Trump: (32:06)
I know, but you ripped the mic out of her hand. You can’t do that.
Speaker 14: (32:07)
Sorry about [inaudible 00:32:09].
Donald Trump: (32:07)
Boy, that wasn’t very nice. He’s worse than you.
Ruchi Bhatia: (32:11)
President Trump, I hope you’re having a good visit here in India. I’m Ruchi Bhatia from ET Now. We have heard from Prime Minister Modi as well as you on a long impending trade deal. It’s still not happened. Even today, we heard both you and him talking about how in future there is going to be one. Have you been able to figure out the kind of differences that were there, especially on data localization? That has been one of the sticky points.
Donald Trump: (32:39)
Yeah. We know the problems. Sure. Yeah, sure, we know the problems. I know the problems. Previous administrations had no clue. They didn’t know the problems. I know the problems. We’re being charged large amounts of tariffs and you can’t do that. You can’t do that. They understand that that’s where I am and if they want to deal with us, and they will, they’re going to, just like China. Everybody said, “You’ll never make a deal with China.” I made a deal with China. It’s a great deal. They’re going to buy $250 billion worth of product and that’s only a piece of the deal. It’s a large piece. It’s probably 40 to 50%, but it’s an incredible deal.
Donald Trump: (33:14)
In addition to that, we’re taking in billions and billions of dollars worth of tariffs that we can now use for phase two, because they want to get rid of the 25%. We have the 25%, they want to get rid of it. Well, with India, India is, I think, the highest, again, I said it before, but the highest tariff. When you deal with India, Harley Davidson has to pay tremendous tariffs when they send motorcycles in here. When India sends motorcycles into the US, there’s virtually no tariff. For the most part, there is absolutely no tariff. I just said that’s unfair and we’re working it out. We’re working it out.
Speaker 15: (33:50)
[crosstalk 00:33:51].
Donald Trump: (33:54)
Go ahead.
Speaker 16: (33:56)
Good evening, President.
Donald Trump: (33:58)
I think we’ll win that one easily. We’re working on that, yeah. We’re working on that too.
Speaker 16: (34:01)
Good evening, President. This is [crosstalk 00:34:03].
Donald Trump: (34:03)
It’s just not a fair situation when one company is paying 100% in the case of numerous companies, not just Harley, but where they’re paying tremendous. Actually tariffs were raised not too long ago. We also did something. There was a form of rent control that was, if you put it in a different sense, it was given to India and we terminated it. We terminated it.
Speaker 15: (34:28)
[crosstalk 00:34:26].
Donald Trump: (34:28)
No, we’re talking. We have great discussions. Look, I can’t lose this. I can’t lose it. You know what? I’ll never lose it. It’s too easy, because I want reciprocal. It has to be reciprocal. The money you’re talking about is major, but the United States has to be treated fairly. India understands that the relationship is outstanding, but India understands that we’ve had a tremendous deficit for many, many years with India, with everybody, with frankly so many different countries. We’ve had a massive, massive deficit, but a large deficit, $30 billion with India, it’s now down to $24 billion because of what we’ve been doing, but still that’s too high. We shouldn’t have a $24 billion deficit. With other countries, we have more than that. Japan, we’re doing now 40 billion is coming in. A lot of very good deals are being made and they’ll be kicking in toward the end of the year. I would say if the deal happens with India, it will be toward the end of the year. If it doesn’t happen, we’ll do something else that’ll be very satisfactory. It’ll be very good. Go ahead. Who else?
Speaker 16: (35:38)
Yeah. President, my question is that you said that the time of the Article 370 application that you would like to mediate in Kashmir, but India rejected it.
Donald Trump: (35:45)
[crosstalk 00:03:47].
Speaker 16: (35:45)
What is your … My question is something different.
Donald Trump: (35:50)
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I didn’t say that. I didn’t say anything about that. I just said Kashmir, obviously, there’s a big problem between Pakistan and India. I think they’re going to work out their problem, but I will say they’ve been doing it for a long time. [crosstalk 00:04:02].
Speaker 16: (36:02)
Okay. My question is something different at the moment. What is your position at the moment on India’s Citizen Amendment Act of the moment?
Donald Trump: (36:08)
I don’t want to discuss that. I want to leave that to India. Hopefully they’re going to make the right decision for the people. That’s really up to India.
Speaker 17: (36:16)
President, good evening.
Donald Trump: (36:16)
Yeah, go ahead, please, please.
Speaker 18: (36:21)
Thank you, Mr. President. My name is [inaudible 00:04:23], an Indian journalist and I have a very simple question.
Donald Trump: (36:26)
Go ahead.
Speaker 18: (36:27)
Now back home, when you reflect upon your tour of India, the first diplomatic visit to the country, how would you describe it, a cultural diplomacy, Trump diplomacy, or do you have any other word for that?
Donald Trump: (36:30)
Well, first of all, I’d describe it as incredible because when I looked at the various things, like today when we went … You probably saw where we were. When you look at all of the things that we’ve seen today, when we look at yesterday, the Taj Mahal and other things, in addition to working in between and even during, where we worked very long and hard with representatives from India, most particularly with the Prime Minister, I just think it’s an incredible country. It’s got unbelievable energy. You see that when you come in from the plane. When you see from … I think I can say virtually from the plane to whatever venue we were going to, it was wall-to-wall people. They’ve never seen anything like it. Somebody said it was the greatest greeting ever given to any head of state from any country. Now, India has more people than any other country, a little bit more than China, a little bit, tiny.
Speaker 18: (37:41)
How would you describe it diplomatically? Is it Trump diplomacy, cultural diplomacy-
Donald Trump: (37:42)
I think the diplomacy is a diplomacy of great friendship and respect. I think it’s going to all work out very well. I really do. I admire your country tremendously. I respect your Prime Minister tremendously. I think it’s really a diplomacy of friendship. I think it’s going to work out very well. Go ahead, please. Please, go ahead, right next to Steve.
Speaker 19: (38:09)
Thank you, Mr. President. As you know, the Chinese government recently ejected several Wall Street Journal reporters. What is your administration considering to do in retaliation to that move? Are you considering banning or restricting the access the Chinese journalists, for example, have of the United States?
Donald Trump: (38:27)
I haven’t really been given a full briefing on that. We’ll get a look at it. We will look at it. It’s something that I don’t like to see. I don’t think it’s fair because we give very good access. Maybe some people would say we give too good. I don’t believe in that. I think we give very good access, so I don’t think it’s fair, but we’ll have a decision made on that relatively soon. Thank you. Good question. Please, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.
Speaker 20: (38:54)
Yeah, you have a policy for Venezuela, so will you allow Canadian companies to continue to buy Venezuelan oil from third parties, especially when you have some [crosstalk 00:39:02]?
Donald Trump: (39:03)
Well, you’ll be seeing something on that in the not too distant future, yeah.
Speaker 20: (39:05)
There could be more stringent sanctions against Venezuela?
Donald Trump: (39:08)
There could be very serious sanctions.
Speaker 20: (39:09)
Against the Indian companies continuing to buy the Venezuela-
Donald Trump: (39:09)
What’s happening in Venezuela is so sad. People are starving. Here’s a case where a country was wealthy 15 years ago, and very wealthy 20 years ago, very, very wealthy, the wealthiest in all of Latin, South America, the wealthiest, and by far, not even a contest. When you look today, they don’t have water. They don’t have basic food. They have no medicine. It’s incredible what’s happened to Venezuela. No, we’re watching Venezuela very closely. We don’t like it. We don’t like it, not at all.
Speaker 20: (39:44)
Are the sanctions going to be against the Venezuelan entities or the Indian companies who will continue to buy the Venezuelan oil?
Donald Trump: (39:48)
You’re going to see in a little while. You’re asking a question right in the middle of us doing something. Go ahead, please.
Speaker 21: (39:56)
[inaudible 00:39:56] from BBC. There was some back home that were hoping you would raise concerns about some of these policies that Prime Minister Modi has introduced that discriminate against Muslims, and also about a rise in hate crimes here in India, but as someone who-
Donald Trump: (40:14)
Well, we did discuss that. We discussed that and specifically Muslims, and we also discussed Christians.
Speaker 21: (40:20)
But someone who you-
Donald Trump: (40:22)
I had a very powerful answer from the Prime Minister. We talked about religious liberty for a long period of time in front of a lot of people. I had a very, very powerful answer. As far as Muslims are concerned, as he told me, I guess they have 200 million Muslims in India. A fairly short while ago they had 14 million. He said that they were working very closely with the Muslim community.
Speaker 21: (40:52)
But sir, you yourself have been criticized for policies that have discriminated against Muslims, like the travel ban. There’s also been a rise in hate crimes over the last couple of years in the US.
Donald Trump: (41:01)
Well, again, [crosstalk 00:41:00]. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 21: (41:01)
Are you in a position to talk to him about those subjects?
Donald Trump: (41:04)
Yeah, I won the travel ban, as you probably know. A lot of people said I lost it. No, I won the travel ban. We used the travel ban where we think there’s, not based on religion, but where we think there’s going to be trouble where we’re looking at certain countries. As you know, we added a few countries onto it, but we won the travel ban and we won it in the Supreme Court. The travel ban is not a thing against Muslims. It’s a thing against areas where we don’t want people coming into our country that are going to cause problems, cause harm, cause death, hurt our people. I feel very strongly about that. Okay, please go ahead.
Jimmy Chan: (41:41)
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I am Jimmy Chan.
Donald Trump: (41:44)
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Jimmy Chan: (41:44)
Thank you. I’m Jimmy Chan with Shanghai Media Group. I’d like to know, some people say that India could be to the US in Asia during the 21st century what the UK was in Europe during the 20th century. How do you view it?
Donald Trump: (42:01)
Well, I think that India is going to be a tremendous player over the next … It’s now, but over the next period of 50 years or 100 years, look, you’re talking about the largest population in the world. You’re talking about a tremendous country in terms of its heritage, its potential wealth, frankly. Right now they have incredible potential. Economically, they have great potential. Their schooling system is getting better all the time. They’re doing a fantastic job in certain sectors with respect to education. We see it. In the United States, we see it. We have a lot of Indian students coming to our schools. They’re great students. They’ve done fantastically well in our schools, but we have thousands and thousands of people coming from India coming to our colleges in particular schools, but our colleges in particular. Now, India has got a phenomenal future. I mean, you can rarely think of a place that has a better future than India, and highly respected, especially with leadership like Prime Minister Modi. Yeah. Go ahead, pick one. Go ahead.
Speaker 22: (43:17)
Sir, [inaudible 00:43:18] from CNBC TV18 India. American companies have been investing in India for a long, long time. Are you satisfied with the Indian investment regime, especially on issues like multibrand, retail and eCommerce, on which companies from US have a lot of interest in?
Donald Trump: (43:34)
I’m very satisfied because they’re investing tremendous amounts of money. I met Mr. Patel a little while ago. He’s the largest steel person in the world by far. I don’t think there’s even a contest. He’s going to be building a billion dollar plant in Alabama. We had the press, I left them in there, always a risky thing to do, but if you see the … Let’s say we have answered 15 questions. They were talking about how much better it is to work in the United States now in terms of their investment. They have done a [inaudible 00:44:05] … some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world. I’m not even sure if the media really understood who they were. I knew many of them, certainly heard of all of them. The job they’ve done is incredible, but Mr. Patel, who’s I think the biggest steel company, certainly the biggest steel individual, but I think he’s the biggest steel company by a lot, he’s investing billions of dollars in the United States. He’s only doing it because of what I’ve done to bring back the steel industry.
Donald Trump: (44:32)
The steel industry was dead, absolutely dead in the United States, and now it’s a vibrant industry. It’s incredible. We need it. Again, we need it for defense. It’s not just like certain industries that you don’t need. We need it for defense, but he was glowing. One of the reasons he’s spending a billion dollars in Alabama, and more money in other places in the United States, is because we brought it back. We’re very proud of that.
Donald Trump: (44:55)
I think what we’ll do is we’re going to see some of you on the plane on the way back. It’s been an honor to be here. It’s an incredible place with incredible leadership and an unbelievable future. I just want to thank you all. I’ll see you back in the States. I think some of you are on the plane and we’ll talk a little bit on the plane too. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much."
"Feb 10, 2020",11:51 A.M. EST,"Donald Trump: (02:41)
Hello, Manchester, and I am thrilled to be in the great state of New Hampshire with thousands of hardworking patriots who believe in God, family, and country. Thank you. Thank you. And I’ll tell you what — we have more in this arena, and I hate to say this to you… we have more than this outside of the arena trying to get in. So if you’d like to give up your seat or where you’re standing… Sorry we couldn’t get you seats, but if you want to give it up, let them come in, you go out. Does anybody want to make that deal? I don’t think so.
Donald Trump: (03:16)
But we have more in this arena and outside of this arena than all of the other candidates, meaning the Democrats, put together and multiplied times fave. And the fake news, these guys will never report that. They’ll never report it. They don’t even like showing the crowd. They always show my face. They never show the crowd. But you know what? The people can hear the crowd. The people can hear the crowd. They know. That is not the sound of 200 people. One of their prime candidates today, they worked a big deal. They had exactly 104 people, and the fake news said, “It was a nice crowd. Very nice.” If I had one empty seat here, one empty seat in this massive arena, they’d say, “He didn’t sell out.” But you know what? We have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and I came down the escalator. Never, not one time. And we have the biggest arenas in the country.
Donald Trump: (05:05)
With your help on November 3rd we are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats. We are going to win New Hampshire in a landslide. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy we’ve ever had, the most prosperity. We have got the most prosperity we’ve ever had. By the way, we’re going to keep it that way, too, if it’s okay.
Donald Trump: (05:40)
And we’ve just built the most powerful military anywhere in the world. It was totally depleted. Now it has all brand new jets. It’s got brand new missiles and rockets and everything you can imagine. And if it hasn’t been shipped yet, it’s going to be shipped soon. On Tuesday, I delivered my address on the State of the Union, and I had somebody behind me who was mumbling terribly, mumbling, mumbling, [inaudible 00:06:19], who was mumbling, very distracting, very distracting. It’s true. You know, it was very distracting. I’m speaking and a woman is mumbling terribly behind me, angry. There was a little anger back there. We’re the ones that should be angry, not them. We’re the ones that should be angry, but we proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. Our country is stronger today than ever before.
Donald Trump: (07:11)
And the day after my address, our good Republicans in the United States Senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full, complete, and absolute, total acquittal. And it ,wasn’t even close and I want to thank our Republican senators and our Republican House members. They were tremendous. In the House, we won 196 to nothing and then we got three Democrats. And in the Senate, other than Romney, we got 52 to nothing, 52 to nothing. That’s something, and in one case we got 53 to nothing, but I don’t even count that to be honest.
Donald Trump: (08:19)
The radical left’s pathetic partisan crusade has completely failed and utterly backfired with 18 votes… think of that… 18 votes to spare, with a lot of votes to spare. And also very importantly, as of today, I… we, because it’s not we. It’s not I. It’s we. We’re all in this together. We have the highest poll numbers that we have ever had. Thank you, Nancy, very much. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (08:57)
While the extreme left has been wasting America’s time with this vile hoax, we’ve been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our borders, and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed. From our rural communities to our cities, we are expanding the blessings of America to all of our citizens. We added another 225,000 new jobs last month alone. Amazing.
Donald Trump: (09:40)
And I listened. I watched. I had all these experts. They were saying, “Yes, I think 60,000.” Another one said 101,000. Another one said 125. Another one was 118. And then the number came out, 225,000. Pretty good. Pretty good. We have destroyed the ISIS caliphate. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS. Al-Baghdadi is dead. Al-Baghdadi is dead, and we just took out the world’s top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever.
Donald Trump: (10:23)
The fact is, America is respected again. It’s been a long time. But as we keep on winning, Washington democrats keep on losing their minds. They’re crazy. That’s why millions of registered Democrat voters are leaving their party to join our movement. They’re joining our great Republican party. Now, I can’t tell you what’s happening tomorrow because you know you have some pretty strange election laws here, right? Remember last time? We won the primary tremendously. We should have won the election, but they had buses being shipped up from Massachusetts, hundreds and hundreds of buses. And it was very, very close even though they did, but this year we have a great governor, Governor Sununu. Great governor, Chris. And now you get prosecuted if you do what they did, so it should be a lot different. But we have done great. This has been an incredible state for us. It’s a state where the people are great, just great people. And we hear that there could be because you have crossovers in primaries, don’t you? So I hear a lot of Republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the Democrats. Does that make sense? You people wouldn’t do that. My only problem is I’m trying to figure out who is their weakest candidate? I think they’re all weak if you want to know the truth.
Donald Trump: (12:06)
We proudly welcome and embrace voters of all parties and political persuasions who want to join our mission. A very simple mission, remember? Make America great again. And then after we make it great again, which we already have… We’ve had 141 days where the stock markets have reached their all-time historical high. 141, think about it. Out of three years, 141. And to me, I view it differently. Well, look at your 401ks. I mean, who is doing well with their 401k? Up 90%. Up 104%. Is there anybody doing badly with the 401k? I’d like to not talk to that person. Does anybody have a 401k where they’re doing badly, please? Oh, don’t put up your hand. I don’t believe it.
Donald Trump: (13:07)
Nah, the 401ks, they’re up 90%, 95%. I always tell this story. People come up to me. They say, “I want to thank you. My wife thinks I’m a total loser, sir. She thinks I am the worst person with money, with financial. She thinks I’m just horrible. In the last three years, I’m up 94%, sir. She thinks I’m a total genius when it comes to finance. She loves me again. She didn’t love me before, sir. She loves me again.” That tells you something about money, doesn’t it?
Donald Trump: (13:43)
The first step to victory in November is tomorrow. Go send a message that Republicans… And you can vote for the weakest candidate if you want. Don’t worry about it. I don’t really think we actually have a candidate against us… that Republicans are energized, that we’re united, and that nine months from now we are going to take back the House of Representatives. We are going to hold the Senate and we are going to keep the White House.
Donald Trump: (14:12)
You know, they always talk about the Democrats. They have enthusiasm, right? We have so much more enthusiasm than them. It’s not even close. They’re all fighting each other. They’re all going after each other. You got them all over the place. They don’t know what the hell they’re doing. They don’t know what they’re doing. They can’t even count their votes.
Donald Trump: (14:44)
We’re thrilled to be joined tonight by many great leaders from across this state and this country, great national leaders. I want to thank our tremendous Vice President, Mike Pence, who spoke earlier this evening. And also with us, our warrior senators, the two people that wanted to be here. They’re going to be here tomorrow. They’re going to be here to get out the vote. I don’t think we have to worry too much about it, but that’s okay… And very highly respected, Senators Lindsey Graham and Rand Paul. Great guys. Warriors, they’re warriors. Hey, Lindsay and Rand. That’s not bad. Can you imagine if you actually came from New Hampshire what it would be? Right? That’s not bad, but they have been great. All they do is they looked at everybody for the last couple of months and they said, “Read the transcripts please. Read the transcripts.” But I want to thank you both very much. Two great people, two great friends. Man, look at all that television back there. Whoa! That’s bigger than those terrible Academy Awards, I’ve got to tell you. That used to be big. Not so much anymore.
Donald Trump: (16:46)
A friend of mine, another great leader and somebody that’s going to be Speaker of the House hopefully next year, Kevin McCarthy. Our leader, Kevin McCarthy. Oh, will that be nice to have Kevin, a pro. You’ll see things get done like you’ll never believe. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Great.
Donald Trump: (17:19)
A very brave man… He took a bullet. He got shot and he got up. He was going to die that night. I tell this story all the time. His wife, she was crying so much. When he finally did awake, I said, “Well, one thing I learned, your wife loves you.” “Why do you say that?” “Because she was devastated.” I know many wives that don’t get too upset. His wife was devastated. His family was devastated. The doctor told me he didn’t have a good chance, but he’s tough as hell and he’s a really terrific friend. He’s a winner. He put himself back into shape. He actually looks better now than he did before he got shot. Steve Scalise. Lot of guts.
Donald Trump: (18:17)
Your NRCC Chairman, Mr, Tom Emmer. Congressman, thank you. Tom Emmer. Thank you, Tom. And Representatives Mark Meadows. Did anybody ever hear of Mark Meadows? These are warriors. Matt Gates. Matt. Whoa! Not bad, Matt. That’s not bad. Mike Johnson, great lawyer. Mike Johnson. Thank you, Mike. And a man with a very familiar last name, Greg Pence, the brother of Mike. Thank you. Thank you, Greg. And thanks also to New Hampshire Senate Republican leader, Chuck Morse. Thank you, Chuck. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (19:13)
And I see somebody, two great people, a great couple in the audience, Matt Schlapp and Mercedes Schlapp. They are warriors also. They’re warriors also. And I see next to them, two warriors. Corey, you just are such a fighter. You are such a fighter. Ah, boy, if we could get him to run for Senate, he would win so easily. Corey Lewandowski, who loves this state a lot. And Dave Bossie. Thank you, David. Thank you, David. Great job.
Donald Trump: (20:06)
I’m just picking these people out of the audience. We have everybody here. The New Hampshire House Republican leader, Dick Hinch. Thank you, Dick. Thank you, Dick. A man who’s been with us right from the beginning… When I left here last time, I felt so good. Everybody coming up to the room, “you’re going to win. You’re going to…” We win by a lot, right? We had actually a total of 18, and we won. We had a tremendous night and I’ve never forgotten it. And there was a friend of ours, Chairman of the New Hampshire Republican party, Steve Stepanek. Steve Stepanek. That was a big evening.
Donald Trump: (20:56)
And three friends of mine that are co-chairmen, Al Baldasaro, Fred Doucette…
Donald Trump: (21:03)
Baldasaro, Fred Ducette, and Lou Gargiulo. Thank you all very much. And David and Corey, thank you also for being here. Also a woman that not too many people know. Very powerful, very smart, very beautiful even though I’m not allowed to say that because she’s my daughter, Ivanka.
Donald Trump: (21:53)
Fred Ducette and Lou Gargiulo. Thank you all very much. And David and Corey, thank you also for being here. Also a woman that not too many people know. Very powerful, very smart, very beautiful, even though I’m not allowed to say that because she’s my daughter, Ivanka. Come here. Come on up, Ivanka.
Donald Trump: (22:14)
And Jared who’s making deals that are so good for this country, people have no idea what’s happening. I will tell you, we are making trade deals and other deals the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. Jared Kushner. Thank you, Jared. Thank you. And Kimberly, thank you so much. I heard your speech on the plane on the way in. I was very impressed. And did Don Jr. make a good speech? Come on.
Donald Trump: (22:39)
They’re good kids. They went through a lot with this hoax, I want to tell you. They went through a lot with the hoax.
Donald Trump: (23:06)
Helping us was the RNC chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel. Great job. I said, “Get me the woman from Michigan to head up the RNC! Who’s that woman from Michigan to head up the RNC?” Thank you, Ronna. Great job. Setting all kinds of records, polling records, contribution records, everything. We’re doing everything so it’s great.
Donald Trump: (23:32)
And Tommy Hicks. I want you to say hello, Tommy Hicks, who’s a special friend. And Haley. Thank you, darling. I retweeted you, Haley. I retweeted you all over the place.
Donald Trump: (23:49)
And all together we’re building the world’s most prosperous economy and the most inclusive society anywhere in the world. It’s a great thing. It’s a great thing. Since my election, America’s gained 7 million new jobs. The unemployment rate has hit the lowest rate in half a century. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. You believe that one? That’s pretty amazing. That’s pretty amazing. The unemployment rate among African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans has reached record lows, all time, never been lower than what it is now.
Donald Trump: (24:43)
And by the way, our poll numbers with African Americans, with Hispanic Americans, with Asian Americans, the other side is getting a little nervous because they are like rocket ships. They’re going up. African American youth unemployment is so important. It was a horrible number a few years ago. You remember, it was a really terrible thing was happening. It’s just reached the lowest time in the history, lowest, the best number in the history of our country.
Donald Trump: (25:20)
And African American poverty numbers have hit the lowest rate ever recorded. Wages for African American workers have increased by $2,400 per year, also a record. And you know this. For decades, the Democrat party has betrayed African Americans. They betrayed us all. They betrayed all of us. But we’re delivering for African Americans. We’re delivering for Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans like nobody has ever done. We are fighting for great jobs, great schools, great healthcare, and a truly great future for our country and for them. We are the party of equal opportunity for all Americans.
Donald Trump: (26:20)
Thank you. To support working families, we’ve reduced the cost of childcare, expanded paid leave, and given 40 million American families an average of $2,200 more in their pockets thanks to the Republican child tax credit. Who would have thought that?
Donald Trump: (26:54)
We have cut more job killing regulations than any… You know this one. So you go back four years, eight years. In one case, longer than eight years. We’ve cut more job killing regulations than any other administration in the history of our country, and we’re not finished.
Donald Trump: (27:18)
We’ve ended the war on American energy. They want to take our energy away. They want to take our wealth away. They want to give us wind. Wind. If it blows, wonderful. If it doesn’t blow, you got problems. Wind. They want to destroy our countrysides, put windmills all over them. Watch your house go down in value. You ever see what happens? They build a windmill within distance of your house. You could forget about your house. You could just say, well, that was the end of that investment. You want to see a bird graveyard, go to the bottom of a windmill. Take a look. It’s a graveyard for birds. They kill all the birds. Lowering utility bills and reducing prices at the pump, that’s what we’re doing.
Donald Trump: (28:05)
We are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies, Washington politicians… You know this. They shuttered New Hampshire factories. You were one of the worst examples ever. NAFTA, what NAFTA to your communities, I mean to your state, is incredible. Shattered your communities and sacrifice your jobs on the altar of globalism. We can forget globalism. We want to take care of our country.
Donald Trump: (28:38)
New Hampshire alone lost one in four manufacturing jobs following that twin disaster of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the WTO, the World Trade Organization, one of the truly bad deals ever made in the history of our country. For decades, politicians campaigned across this state promising to replace NAFTA. They lied. They never did it. They never even tried to do it. They wouldn’t have been able to anyway. It wasn’t easy, I will tell you that. But then they got elected and they did absolutely nothing.
Donald Trump: (29:10)
But I’m not like those other politicians. I keep my promises. We took care of it. We took care of it. You saw last month being bye-bye. I say Donald J. Trump, bye-bye NAFTA. We ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new US Mexico Canada Agreement into law. That’s going to be great for our manufacturers, our farmers. Great for everybody. Great for our workers. The USMCA will bring jobs back to New Hampshire right where they belong. They should have never left in the first place.
Donald Trump: (29:51)
Probably the number one reason I ran for office. I’m one for one. I have friends. Some of these great senators, look at Lindsey over there and look at Rand. These great senators. Sure, I’ve run five times and I’ve won three. And other senators said “Sir, I’ve won seven times, sir.” Southern senator. “I won seven times, sir, and I’ve won five of those damn contests.” I said, “Senator, I ran once and I won just once.” And we’re going to run twice and that’s going to be it. Although they think we’re going to run much more than that, you know that, right? It scares the hell out of the fake news, I will tell you. They can’t take a joke.
Donald Trump: (30:34)
I also took the strongest ever action to confront China’s massive theft of American jobs, and our strategy worked. Massive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in, poured in by the billions and billions. We never took in 25 cents from China. They ripped us so much you wouldn’t believe it. Now they respect us again. Last month we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defeat so many of our opponents. The money that’s pouring in, people don’t even believe it.
Donald Trump: (31:09)
And by the way, the virus, they’re working hard. Looks like by April, in theory when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away. I hope that’s true, but we’re doing great in our country. China, I spoke with president Xi and they’re working very, very hard and I think it’s going to all work out fine. Rough stuff, I tell you. Rough, rough stuff, but I think it’s going to work out good. We only have 11 cases and they’re all getting better. But our trade agreement with China will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and substantially boost exports of American made goods. Is that nice?
Donald Trump: (31:53)
After years of building up other countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. On no issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than a thing called immigration, right? Before I came into office, the far left’s policy of open borders allowed deadly drugs to flow freely into our country and that’s what they want. I see them campaigning right down the street. It’s really boring to watch, but I try and watch. No, I have an obligation to watch really boring stuff. But they want open borders. They want thousands and thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom are not exactly what we’re looking for, okay? I mean murderers, rapists, and some other things. They’re going to be poisoning our children with drugs, including right here in New Hampshire, and you have one of the drug problems in the country. And we brought it down 18% but we have to do better. 18%. Washington Democrats put the needs of illegal immigrants before the wellbeing of American citizens. They want to let anyone into our country from all around the world. Just come on in, folks, we’re going to give you free healthcare. We’re going to give you free education. We’re going to give you more than our vets are getting. Every family will get a free Rolls Royce. You know I said that, Matt. I said that to them and some of the fake news picked it up and they said, “President Trump said every family coming into our country illegally gets a brand new free Rolls Royce. He lied. He lied. He lied.” They gave me a Pinocchio. They don’t get it, Matt, do they, Matt? Actually they get it better than we understand. They get it very well. They get it. They know what’s happening. And the wall is being built. I will tell you the wall is being built. And you know they went after us on everybody knows the wall is going up. So what’s happening? You do know who’s paying for the wall, don’t you? Right. Redemption from illegal aliens that are coming. The redemption money is paying for the wall. They’re so sad to hear that because it’s okay, finally, they go. You have to understand an entire party is fighting. They’ll give me anything I want. Our military would rebuilt it. 2.2, it’s really $2.5 trillion over a period of three years. They give me anything but not 25 cents for the wall. They said, “We like drones.” Well, drones don’t keep people out. Drones are wonderful. They fly around, take pictures. We’re going to give you a drone. No good. So we now have built over 100 miles of wall.
Donald Trump: (35:09)
And when we have that wall built, you have to see what happens to the illegal aliens that don’t come in. I say they can’t come in. They don’t come in. So we up to over a hundred, substantially more than a hundred miles of wall, and we’ll have close to 500 miles of wall in the very near future. And by the way, you have to see. You wouldn’t believe it. You have to see what happens when that wall goes up. You have to see the numbers change like magic. They change like magic. You ever hear the thing with all the modern technology, all of the new computers, the new genius, the new everything, cyber this, cyber that, two things never change, right? A wheel and a wall.
Donald Trump: (36:10)
[inaudible 00:36:10] Right? A wheel and a wall. They’re going to have a lot of brilliant people working over the years. They’re never going to replace the wheel and they’re never going to replace the wall, and it’s a high wall. Illegal immigrants coming in, coming into our country illegally, very few of them are getting in right now. Mexico has been terrific. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border and the numbers went down 87% from this year and this time last year.
Donald Trump: (36:43)
And for the amount of money Washington Democrats want to spend supporting illegal immigrants, we could rebuild the cities in America. We could rebuild our cities. But I have something, because people were screaming to me for the last four or five rallies, read the snake. The snake. Does anybody know what I’m talking about? She knows. She’s been standing outside for four days, no wonder. And you look good, I’ll tell you what. Four days outside in the rain and snow. Look at these front row people. These are warriors. They’re warriors too, like my congressmen and senators.
Donald Trump: (37:25)
So this is because we mentioned… [inaudible 00:37:27] I made minor changes. They mentioned illegal immigration. This is about immigration. This was a song from the 1950s, Al Green. And they mentioned little changes to it, that’s okay. But they mentioned illegal immigration, right? And I used to do this a lot and people couldn’t get enough of it, to be honest with you. And I haven’t done it for a while, and I thought I’d do it tonight because you’re on the eve of giving us an opponent and all of these people want open borders. They want open borders, and we don’t want open borders. We want very strong closed borders. And we want people to come into our country, but they want to come in through merit and we want them to come in legally, right? Right? Through merit and legally. Right?
Donald Trump: (38:22)
So we’ll do this quickly. This is illegal immigration. It’s called… Oh, listen to how quiet it is. Listen to how quiet. Now watch how quiet it gets. Gets so quiet. But this is all about… I love you too. That was a guy that said that, but I love him too. I love everybody. Ready? So important. Illegal immigration.
Donald Trump: (38:53)
On our way to work one morning down the path along the lake, a tender hearted woman saw a poor half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. “Poor thing,” she cried, “I’ll take you in and I’ll take care of you.” Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake.
Donald Trump: (39:28)
She wrapped him up all cozy in a comforter of silk and laid him by her fireside with some honey and some milk. She hurried home from work that night and as soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she’d taken in had been fully, fully revived. Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed that vicious snake.
Donald Trump: (39:58)
She clutched him to her bosom. “You’re so beautiful,” she cried. “But if I hadn’t brought you in by now, you truly would have died.” She stroked his pretty skin again and kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, the snake gave her a vicious bite. Take me in, oh tender woman, take me in for heaven’s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman, sighed the vicious snake.
Donald Trump: (40:35)
“I saved you,” cried the woman, “and you’ve bitten me, but why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I’m going to die.” “Shut up, silly woman,” said the reptile with a grin. “You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.” Got to come in legally and through merit. Under my administration we’re fully taking care of our own citizens first, including millions of African American and Hispanic Americans who are entitled to a government that protects their families and their communities. In this region of the country alone last year, ICE officers… We love our ICE officers. The Democrats don’t like them. The Democrats don’t like them. ICE officers are the toughest human beings, and they love the country as much as anybody in this room. Last year alone they
Donald Trump: (42:03)
… in this room. Last year alone, they arrested over 2,000 criminal aliens charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. Over 2,000 accused of murder, yet left wing politicians support sanctuary cities that release criminal aliens directly into the American community. One of guests at the State of the Union was American citizen, Jody Jones. I introduced him that night. His beloved brother, Rocky, was murdered by a criminal alien in California, shot him eight times at close range, wouldn’t stop. Rocky’s killer had been previously arrested many, many times, but under California’s totally insane and outrageous sanctuary law, authorities were ordered to set him free.
Donald Trump: (42:59)
Tragically, left wing politicians in New Hampshire tried to replicate California’s disastrous policies. Last year, the Democrat controlled New Hampshire house blocked legislation that would have banned sanctuary cities in your state. And by the way, you have a great governor, Chris Sununu. He’s on top of it. He’s on top of it. And his father is a great guy. His father didn’t like me too much a few years ago. Once I won, I’m telling you, he was so good. He was as good. He fought like hell for us, all of us. It’s a great family, and Chris is doing a fantastic job.
Donald Trump: (43:43)
If you want to shut down sanctuary cities, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote Republican in 2020, November. And thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down now at record numbers and we’ve ended catch and release. You know what catch and release is? You catch an illegal alien by law. You then take his name and address. They don’t have addresses. What’s your address? What? They don’t have addresses. They come into the country, they don’t have addresses. So you take his name and then you have to release him into the country and you say, “We’ll see you in four years for your court case.” We never see them. They never come back. We have seized record amounts of drugs. We have deported record numbers of gang members, MS-13 by the thousands. And we have done more to secure the border of our country than any administration in history.
Donald Trump: (44:59)
Remember this. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme. Taking their cues from crazy Bernie, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie’s healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their very, very coveted private coverage. The Democrat party wants to run your healthcare, but they can’t even run a caucus in Iowa. By the way, it’s a week, a week. You know I turned on at seven o’clock. I wanted to see who won. They said, “There’s a little problem.” Little did they know? Does anybody [inaudible 00:45:53] … Does anybody know who won Iowa? I don’t know. Maybe Rander, Lindsey. Grant, does anybody know who won? Lindsey, you’re a total pro. Nobody knows. He said nobody. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. They’re going to run your health care. Unbelievable. Nobody knows who won. Actually, I think they’re trying to take it away from Bernie again. I think Bernie came in second. Can you believe it? They’re doing it to you again, Bernie. They’re doing it to you again.
Donald Trump: (46:34)
We’re saving your healthcare while these socialist Democrats are trying to take away your healthcare. We are making healthcare better and much, much cheaper. You’ve seen what we did. We are protecting people with preexisting conditions and we always will. The Republican party always will. Always will. And we got rid of the most unpopular thing in the healthcare world, the individual mandate. We had to pay a fortune not to have pay a fortune. You paid a fortune not to pay a fortune for bad healthcare. And we got rid of it, saved a lot of money for a lot of people. And we’re stopping surprise medical bills and making everything transparent. That’s bigger than healthcare transparency and that’ll go unfortunately into effect right around the election time. It would be nice if we could get it earlier, but it’s all done. It’s all signed.
Donald Trump: (47:35)
Because when providers are required to show you what the prices are, those prices are going to come tumbling down. Blood tests as an example, one hospital has them for $53. Another hospital, the same test, $2,415. Same exact test. And it may even be better, who knows? We’re approving more generic drugs than ever before at any time in the history of our country. That’s bringing prices down. We are defending your right to keep the doctor and to keep your plan. Remember President Obama, you could keep your plan. You could keep 28 times. You can keep your doctor. That didn’t turn out very good. We should impeach him for that. Why aren’t we impeaching him? 28 times, you can keep your doctor. We should impeach President Obama.
Donald Trump: (48:25)
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? Abraham Lincoln. Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background, every community and every walk of life. We are the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy, and enthusiasm. We love people. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. People are signing up left and right. But if you want to vote for a weak candidate tomorrow, go ahead. Pick one. Pick the weakest one you think, I don’t know who it is. We are a big party with big ideas for the future. Very big. We become a big party and an open-minded party and we’re the party that people like. We’re the hot party and we’re the party with all the enthusiasm. We are fighting for school choice because no parent should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. Right?
Donald Trump: (49:54)
We pass criminal justice reform to give former prisoners a second chance at life. Most incredible thing that’s happened. Prisoners never really had a shot. They’d get out, they couldn’t get a job no matter what they did, and they’d go back. They’d go back to their ways. I mean, in many cases I guess they had no choice. It was a disaster. Now they’re getting out and because our economy is so good and because of what we’ve done with criminal justice reform and other things like opportunities, zones, et cetera, they’re getting jobs and employers are loving them. They’re doing great. They’re doing great. They are doing great first time ever. They’re not going back.
Donald Trump: (50:39)
To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. And as you know, we’ve also confirmed two great new Supreme Court justices. Thank you very much. Thank you, Grant. Thank you, Lindsey. Thank you. We have invested $2.2 trillion to rebuild the United States military, as I said, and I love saying it because we are funding for New Hampshire, the New Hampshire Army National Guard readiness centers just a few miles from here in Pembroke and in Concord. Concord, I love Concord. I love Concord. Oh, Concord. You know how famous Concord is? Concord. That’s the same Concord that we read about all the time, right? Concord. I love Concord.
Donald Trump: (51:47)
I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And we recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, been trying to do that for 52 years. We got it done. And for years you watched as your politicians … They really, I mean, they went out, “I’d like to apologize for the behavior of the United States.” No, no. We don’t know we don’t apologize anymore. We don’t apologize. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of New Hampshire. Thank you. At stake in our present battle is to survival actually of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory November 3rd, 2020. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. And I will tell you, that swamp is much worse than I thought when I was out here innocently campaigning. Let’s drain the swamp. That swamp is a lot worse than anybody ever thought. That swamp is that dirty swamp.
Audience: (53:07)
Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp. Drain that swamp.
Donald Trump: (53:09)
That’s a dirty swamp. You have some really evil, dirty, horrible people. Like to say nice, everyone’s nice. They’re not good. They’re not good people. But we’re draining that sucker slowly but surely.
Donald Trump: (53:36)
With your help, we will lift millions of more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together, we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. How about that? It’ll be done. We will land the first woman in the moon and become the first nation in the world to plant its flag on Mars. We’re very advanced. All made in the USA. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to-
Audience: (54:56)
Keep and bear arms.
Donald Trump: (55:13)
… keep and bear arms. We’re going to protect your Second Amendments. By the way, they’re going to take away everything. They’re going to take away your wealth. They’re going to take away your guns. They’re going to take away everything. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, “In God we trust.”
Donald Trump: (56:29)
From Nashua to Dixville, from Portsmouth to Plymouth, from Concord to Claremont, and from Meredith to right here in Manchester, we stand on the shoulders of red-blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. New Hampshire was founded by tough frontier men and strong, powerful pioneer women who defied the dangers and raised their children to embrace the eternal motto, “Live free or die.” I love that motto. Live free or die. These courageous Americans tamed the wilderness, braved the elements, changed the hills, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth and we are making it greater. Every single day, greater than ever before.
Donald Trump: (57:47)
Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That’s what this is all about. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of New Hampshire, the best is yet to come.
Audience: (58:37)
To come. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.
Donald Trump: (59:00)
Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, New Hampshire. Thank you."
"Feb 7, 2020",11:19 A.M. EST,"Donald Trump: (00:29)
Good music, but we have to get down to business. We’re in North Carolina, and they talk business. But I want to just thank everybody for being here. Wonderful crowd. Oh, look up there, look at all those people. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thank you to Ben, a special guy. He was very tough, you know, on the campaign trail. I had to fight him for a long time. He wouldn’t go away. He doesn’t give up. And he’s smart, and he’s good, and he was a great surgeon, and, I don’t know, he gave that up for politics? I’m going to have to talk to you about that. Where is he sitting? Where is he? Ma- you, why did, I’m going to talk to you about that later. Have to explain, I think he’s probably regretting that now. He’s doing an incredible job, an incredible job. You really are, Ben.
Donald Trump: (01:20)
Housing. He’s done a job like few people have done it, but wonderful to be here with the incredible men and women who are restoring prosperity. That’s what you’re doing. Rebuilding hope and delivering opportunity to those who need it most. Together we’re making our country stronger than ever before. We are doing numbers that you wouldn’t even believe. Nobody would have thought it was possible. This morning the brand new jobs numbers came in. We smashed expectations and created 225 thousand new jobs last month. 225 thousand. They were thinking maybe 100, maybe 105. I was watching all the geniuses this morning on television. What do you think it’s going to be? It’s going to be 110. 225. Pretty good, right? 225 thousand for last month. That’s only last month.
Donald Trump: (02:12)
Unemployment claims in North Carolina are down 30% since the election and have fallen to their lowest level ever recorded. Pretty good. And we’re here in Charlotte to expand and grow this unprecedented economic momentum that we have going all over the country. You’re having the best year you’ve ever had in this state by far. Today we’re launching a brand new nationwide campaign to revitalize underserved cities and towns all across America. It’s called Opportunity Now. Opportunity Now. It’s a big deal.
Donald Trump: (02:51)
And you know we did with Tim Scott, Opportunity Zones, and they’re the hottest thing you’ve seen. Their money is pouring in, Tim from South Carolina, and the money is, anybody from South Carolina here? Huh? Say hello to Tim. He really did, he came to my office with this idea, and I said, “Sounds good.” But those things traditionally have not worked, and Opportunity Zones are, amazing what’s happened. Tremendous amounts of money being put into areas that hadn’t seen money for decades and decades.
Donald Trump: (03:22)
Anyway, so what we’re doing is because we aren’t waiting for tomorrow and we aren’t deferring people’s dreams to another day, with relentless optimism we’re taking action right now, and I mean right now, to create a future of dignity and security for all. Going to be an incredible situation, you’ll see. And we believe in no American left behind. That’s what it’s all about. No American left behind. In the coming months my administration will hold summits just like this one in cities across the country, working closely with community leaders, workers, entrepreneurs, employers, and faith leaders, our great faith leaders, so many great people I’ve met. You know, we got ready of the Johnson Amendment so they can speak their will, right? Right? To make sure that every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success and every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise, together we’re building the most inclusive economy and the most inclusive society ever to exist. We’re fighting for great jobs, great education, safe homes, and a limitless future for our people. We’re lifting high citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. We are all Americans and we are all made equal by the hand of Almighty God. You know that very well.
Donald Trump: (04:54)
Joining us today is small business administrator Jovita Carranza, who is helping to lead this groundbreaking effort along with Secretary Carson. Jovita? Where is Jovita? Jovita. Good! Thank you, Jovita. Great job.
Donald Trump: (05:11)
Thanks also to the many great members of Congress that you have with us, and these are warriors. These aren’t like, these people have been fighting hard. Do you mind if I take a mi- am I allowed to take a s- couple of seconds and introduce them? I call them warriors. Senators and Congressmen and women, but they’ve been incredible. You saw what happened. It was the impeachment hoax. And now that’s a thing of the past, so now they have a failed impeachment hoax. They can put that on their resume. That doesn’t go good on a resume, right? That’s a failed hoax. Every one of them have to put it right on that resume. It was a fix, except when it got up to Congress where we had 197 to nothing. Our Republicans hung in, and our tensors were incredible. They were really incredible, same kind of a thing, and a man’s here who’s really become a friend over the last year and a half, and we had a good relationship, but we sort of disagreed on a couple of minor policies, and that’s okay. Of course I won’t put up with it for long, Thom Tillis. He’s been a great friend.
Donald Trump: (06:42)
It’s true. Now we just had some disagreements at the beginning, and now at the last year, year and a half, boy, it’s been good. Right? It’s been good, and you have something on sanctuary cities that’s going to be incredible. It got one of the big hands that, I know nobody listened to the speech yet tonight, but it got a big hand. Going to be good. You got to push that, right? So Thom, thank you, and thank you for your support. It was great, your vote and everything else, and we have some Congressmen. I’ve gotten to know them well. It’s like we were in the trenches together. Representative Ted Budd. Thanks, Ted. Good job. A man I campaigned with and he was fantastic. He handled pressure very well. They said you couldn’t win and he won by a lot. We did a little bit of a rally for two guys that are very special. One of them is Dan Bishop, Dan. Thank you, Dan. He campaigned and he didn’t choke. There was no choke. He had a lot of pressure but he ended up, won by, like, five or six points. It was, like, boring that evening. You were winning by too much. I thought it was going to be a lot closer than that, right? Richard Hudson, another one. Great. Richard, great. Good job.
Donald Trump: (08:09)
Everybody knows Mark Walker. Thanks, Mark. Another one of those too that I talked about recently, you know, CNN, they all had their vans. They were all ready because they thought we’d have two losses, and they go out and say, “Trump had a terrible night.” But they both won. And this guy was pretty even, and I think he won by 28 points, right? It was like… Greg Murphy. Right, Greg? He won by a lot. They both won by a lot. A man that I’ve gotten to know too well. I love his wife. I mean, his wife, she was with me before he was with me, I have to say. But he came along very quickly. A long time ago, right? And she would go out with Women for Trump. They had buses. She had buses all over the place, right? Deb, where is she? Where’s our Deb? Oh, there. Well, I know them. Because they followed me around a little bit, right? They are incredible. They are incredible. How many have you come to, how many rallies have you? This isn’t a rally, you know. This is a serious deal. How many rallies, would you say? A lot. And we have a lot of fun. Thank you very much, hon.
Donald Trump: (09:36)
Mark Meadows, everybody. Mark. Great guy. A man who is without question the greatest name in politics. I said, if I had his name, I would have been president at least 10 years sooner. Patrick McHenry. Right? Best name in politics. A woman who’s much tougher than any of these people. She doesn’t stop, right? Mark, she doesn’t stop. But she’s great. We love her. Virginia Fox. A very popular guy who wins elections by a lot. He’s a tremendous asset to Congress, and a tremendous friend, Ralph Norman. Ralph? Thank you, Ralph. We call him landslide Ralph, because he wins by a lot. William Timmons. William, thank you. Great job. Great job. And a man whose son I probably like even more than him, Allen. What a job Allen’s done. Joe Wilson is tough and smart and he is there all the time, and his son is just like him. His son is better than him, I think. Right? And he doesn’t mind. You know, I have a lot of fathers that, they don’t like it when I say that. I’ve had some, please don’t say that my son is better. They say, “You’re not a good father!” He’s a great father. And he’s proud of his son. His son’s fantastic, and he’s fantastic, and thank you very much. Thanks, Joe.
Donald Trump: (11:21)
So we’re honored to be joined by North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest, who’s… big future. Big future. You got to get rid of the sanctuary city, Dan. You going to be able to do that? I think, right? A lot of people want to get rid of them. Plenty of people in California want to get rid of them. Believe me, it’s something. And we have many other state and local leaders from all across North Carolina. We’re thrilled to have you all here, and you’re the ones that really know best, and we’re spending a lot of time in this state. We’ll be coming here. Lewis is around someplace. Where’s Lewis? Lewis, the joy. Thank you very much, and I appreciate it. We’ll be coming here a lot. And we’re way up in the polls, but you know what I say? I pretend one point down everywhere. Somebody said, “How you doing?” I said, “Well, one point down everywhere.” But we’re way up. That’s what they tell me. Way up in North Carolina. Way up in South Carolina. Way, way up in South Carolina. Ralph? Way, way up. So anyway. So we just assume, it’s always good. I always say, “Pretend you’re one point down.” That way you work your ass off, right? We have to do that, because this is the most important election coming up. This election is, I used to say the other and the other. You know, the other is the other. 2016 was incredible. But you see what’s going on? You see what’s happening on the other side? They want to take everything away. They want to destroy everything we’ve built. We’ve got the most successful country in our history. They want to take it away. Not going to happen. It’s not going to happen.
Donald Trump: (13:05)
As I said in my State of the Union Address earlier this week, our nation is in the midst of the single greatest comeback that we’ve ever had. This is a comeback. We were doing poorly. And if you remember, it goes all the way back, for years I heard that China will take over as the largest economy in the world in 2019. I kept hearing that. I hated it, because I said, “If I run, 2019’s not so far away.” We are so far ahead. We are so far ahead now. We became a rocket ship, taking in billions and billions and billions in tariffs, giving a lot of it to our farmers and different people that we targeted. Now we have a deal with China. I just spoke to President Xi last night, and we’re working on the problem, the virus. It’s a very tough situation, but I think he’s going to handle it. I think he’s handling it really well. We’re helping wherever we can. But we have a great relationship. It’s incredible. They respect us again. They didn’t even respect us. What they were doing to us, they didn’t even respect us. They respect us again and we respect them. And we think, I think we have the best relationship we’ve had with China, but it’s really incredible.
Donald Trump: (14:19)
So we signed the deal. We signed the Mexico Deal and Canada Deal, USM Deal. Signed a deal with Japan, $40 billion coming in. Signed a deal with South Korea, which had a terrible deal. That was a deal made by crooked Hillary Clinton. She said, 250 thousand jobs this will produce! It’s going to produce 250 thousand jobs! And she was right. For them. They got 250 thousand jobs. She never said that. She said 250 thousand jobs. Anyway, we changed it around. We said, “Sorry about that, but we’re changing this deal around.” For decades, Washington politicians put special interests ahead of American interests. They enacted disastrous trade, really, and I mean disastrous trade policies, like, it’s imaginable, frankly. I looked at some of these deals. I said, “Who the hell would have done this? Who would have done this? A child wouldn’t have agreed to this stuff.” Unbelievable. And we’re still here. You know, it’s pretty incredible when you think of it, but I don’t know that we would have been for long.
Donald Trump: (15:22)
So we change them around, but the trade policies that shuttered our factories, gutted our communities, and shipped millions and millions and millions of jobs overseas and to other places. They spend trillions of dollars in the Middle East, but they allowed our own cities to crumble in total disrepair. You have a road. You have a bridge. You have a school. We build schools in Afghanistan. They blow it up. We rebuild it. They blow it up. We rebuild it. But if a school in South Carolina needed money, if a school in North Carolina needed money, if a school in Florida, any of the places, you know it right here, North, you can’t get money. But we get you the money. We get you the money. But they spend almost eight trillion dollars now in the Middle East. Terrible. Terrible thing. But we’re doing tremendous work and a lot of our soldiers are coming back home. You see it. You see what’s happening. They’re all coming back. They weren’t meant to be law enforcement. They weren’t meant to be law enforcement. They’re meant to be soldiers, you know. And we love our law enforcement, but we didn’t put the soldiers over there to be law enforcement.
Donald Trump: (16:38)
And they impose crushing government burdens that punish working class Americans of all backgrounds. But not anymore. Those days have changed, and they’ve changed very quickly, and more so than you’re even hearing about. After years of building up other countries, we are finally building our country. From our inner cities to rural communities all over the land, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no longer, because we are finally putting America first. Took a long time, long time. A long time. Our economy is now the envy of the entire world, as you have to see when leaders come to my office, this beautiful Oval Office. I’ve had people walk into the office. It’s beautiful. But they have more beautiful in many cases, I guess, but it’s what it represents. They walk in, powerful people, big people, and you see them crying. I’ve seen heads of corporation walk in. Have you ever seen the Oval Office? “No, I haven’t.” How many times have you been in the White House. “51 times,” they’ve said, the head of a big car company, “51 times.” Huh. Have you ever seen the Oval Office. “No. They never took me.” I’ll take you in. I like showing it, all right? I’ll take you in. And you see them start to cry. Tough people. They haven’t cried since they were a baby, some of them never cried at all, even when they were a baby. And they start to cry when they walk into the Oval Office. Pretty amazing.
Donald Trump: (18:15)
Since my election, America has gained seven million brand new jobs, including 220 thousand brand, brand, beautiful new jobs in a place called North Carolina. Isn’t that great? Great state. New business applications in North Carolina have surged by 30%. African-American workers have gained 1.3 million jobs. For the first time ever… think of this. For the first time ever, most new hires, that’s new jobs, are minorities and women. Think of that. First time ever. The unemployment rate has just hit, and has been for a little while, but just hit the lowest in over 50 years. The average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any previous administration in the history of our country. Think of that, the average rate. The average rate, and you’ve heard me say this many times, but I keep saying it, because I think people are really getting it and understanding what’s going on. This has been an incredible thing. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American unemployment, Asian-American unemployment, have all reached the lowest levels in our country. I say it, because, you know. Very importantly, African-American youth unemployment has reached its lowest level ever recorded. African-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rate ever recorded, the best numbers we’ve ever had. Remember I used to say, “What do you have to lose?” I was in a room and it started, and I’m reading off economic numbers, the worst crime numbers, worst housing ownership numbers, worst everythi- just, worst education. Worst everything. I think there were nine or 10 different very major factors, African-American. I said, “You’ve been with the Democrats for 100 years,” 112 to be exact, but for over 100 years. And they treat you badly. And they only come around two months before the election. And then right after the election, they say, “Bye-bye. We’ll see you in two years or four years.” But they come around and they work real hard. They want your vote. And then the day after the election, they’re gone. That’s the Democrats. And I said, “Always bad numbers. What the hell do you have to lose?” I say it two ways. When I have a very sophistica-
Donald Trump: (21:03)
What the hell do you have to lose? I say it two ways. When I have a very sophisticated, tough group like this, I say, “What the hell do you have to lose?” And when I have a very kind group, I know too many of the people in those [inaudible 00:00:15], not so kind. But I say, “What do you have to lose?” It’s very much less effective when I say it that way. When I go, “What do you have to lose?” It’s like, let’s fall asleep. But when I say, but I remember I said it this night, I said, what… 25,000 people? I said, ” What the hell do you have to lose?” Place went crazy. Then I went off stage and my people told me, “I don’t know, that’s not nice.” I said, “No, it’s true.” It’s true. What do they have to lose? Right? They didn’t like it. They didn’t like it.
Donald Trump: (21:48)
That’s why they’re all looking for jobs. We didn’t take [inaudible 00:21:51]. But I said, “No, we got to get the point across.” And we did well in the election, but now we’re doing numbers that I think maybe no Republican has done. We’re doing numbers, let’s see if that has to carry, November 3rd, we have to go to November 3rd. But the numbers have been incredible.
Donald Trump: (22:10)
Thank you for putting on that beautiful hat. I love that hat, but thank you man. But it’s incredible. What you’re seeing now is incredible. It’s a Renaissance for African American, but for Asian American, for women, for everybody. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded in history. Think of that. There’s a lot of people, they don’t have a diploma. They didn’t go to high school. They went to high school and they didn’t graduate, let’s say. And now they’re doing well. Low income workers have seen a 16% increase since my election. That’s in wages. That’s a record. This is a blue collar boom.
Donald Trump: (22:57)
Wages for African American workers have increased by $2,400 per year. That’s a record. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%. that’s three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. Larry Kudlow left. He said, “Please, please read this.” I say, “Who the hell is going to know what it means?” But you know what it means? It means that people that are really working hard that aren’t doing so well, haven’t done well, are doing proportionately better then people that are doing very well. It’s great.
Donald Trump: (23:32)
Median household income reached the highest level ever recorded. Think of that one. Median household income. And think of it, President Bush for eight years, $450. President Obama for eight years, it’s $975. President Trump, and really when they did this stat, it was two and a half, now we’re at the three. We’re a little over three. Can you believe how fast we’re going? See? We’ll keep the rallies going. Don’t worry. Even if we win, even when we win next time we’ll do rallies. Okay? But no, think of it. So you have 450, you have 975, and now you have two and a half, but let’s say three years, instead of eight years. So it’s eight, eight and three. And with us, when you add the tax cuts and we add the regulation cuts, it’s close to $10,000, and that’s in a short period. That’s what’s fueling the boom. That’s what’s fueling the stock market. That’s why other countries aren’t doing well and we are.
Donald Trump: (24:35)
And incredibly according to the Gallup Poll, no friend of mine, they tend to be slightly left of center, like about 200 degrees, 90% of Americans say they’re satisfied with their personal life, the highest percentage ever. I wonder what their definition of personal life is. I don’t know. It’s an a strange, that’s a strange poll, I’ve never heard of a pole like that. Are you happy with your personal life? Is everyone here happy with their personal life?
Donald Trump: (25:08)
I know Mark Meadows is. No, it’s a strange… Paul, I’m trying to… If I give you definition of [inaudible 00:25:13], had a lot of definitions you could get there. To lift up underserved communities across the nation, our tax cuts created nearly 9,000 opportunity zones. Again, Tim Scott, including more than 250 right here in North Carolina. So that’s something. 250 in North Carolina. Longterm investment in these communities is now taxed at zero. These deserving communities have not known opportunity in a long time, but now the investments are flooding in creating energy and creating excitement like they haven’t seen for a long time. One of the Americans benefiting from this gusher of new investment is a man who became very famous the other night because I introduced him during the State of the Union. Army veteran Tony Rankins of Cincinnati, Ohio. Good place. I had a summer job in Cincinnati. I worked in Cincinnati one summer. I did a good job. I did it a good job. I love Cincinnati. The Queen City. I love Cincinnati.
Donald Trump: (26:19)
After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house, his family, and he was homeless. He lost everything. But then Tony found a construction company that does work in opportunity zones, and the company saw Tony’s great skill and talent, helped him lift himself out of homelessness, break free of addiction, and these are great people. And they trained him for the new job. He didn’t need that much training either. Tony is now a top carpenter who renovates historic buildings in Cincinnati. He’s drug-free and he’s reunited with his family. And Tony, I’d love to have you come up and say a few words please. Tony. Tony Rankins.
Tony Rankins: (27:03)
Thank you. Thank you. I’m not a public speaker, so bear with me. First of all, I would like to thank the President for signing this bill, because without it I wouldn’t be standing here before you right now. It means a lot to me and I know it means a lot to the people that we’re going to help. I was homeless and due to that fact, I know how it feels and I know that sometimes when you’re down you don’t feel like getting up. But with this bill that has been passed, it’s going to be an opportunity for a lot of people to not be homeless and to get back on their feet and to go back with their families. And I just would like to thank the President of the United States for doing this. [inaudible 00:28:23].
Donald Trump: (28:41)
A lot of love. The fact is, he became very famous, so he’ll leave his job as a carpenter, he’ll go to California, become a movie star. You never know. Tony, thanks a lot. They really did. And they loved you the other night.
Tony Rankins: (28:57)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (28:57)
Sat right next to my daughter, Ivanka, and great. Really great. The construction businesses is where Tony’s employed and working to help 200 people rise out of homelessness every year by investing in the opportunity zones. And now they’re coming to North Carolina to build housing for veterans in an opportunity zone right here in Charlotte. And I want to thank… I want to thank their founder and ask their founder, Travis Stephens, to please come up and say a few words. Please Travis. Thank you, Travis. You know, Tony got a much bigger hand than the boss. Right? Much bigger.
Travis: (29:56)
Thank you all for investing your time to be here today. It’s awesome. Thank you for loving on Tony. Tony, thank you for being the man that you are. And Mr. President, thank you for passing this incredible bill. We’re all here to celebrate opportunity zones and being part of the private sector, I just really want to implore all of us to pull together for the opportunity that we have to reunite this country through this bill. We’ve been working in opportunity zones for 14 years and over that time, that’s when we fell in love with being able to help the people in these areas. And all of us having the opportunity to take advantage of these long term investments, which is what’s going to really make the difference, is really where it’s at.
Travis: (30:44)
And so this bill was really well thought through with this 10 year enactment, and being able to have that amount of focus on these areas is really what’s going to be impactful. And understanding that putting the people first, the money will come later. I guarantee it and we’re proof of that. So, we’ve helped hundreds of people like Tony and you guys can do the exact same thing. So we’d love to share our model. We’d love to explore it with you. We have an awesome algorithm and it’s not proprietary. We’d love to help this expand across the country.
Donald Trump: (31:25)
[inaudible 00:10:31]. How did he do, Tony? Okay? Did okay? He did good, right?
Tony Rankins: (31:38)
He did all right.
Donald Trump: (31:39)
You did better. He did better. Thank you very much. And thank you Travis. And it’s 200 people I think, Travis. So that’s tremendous. 200. You’ll be up to a lot more than that. To further support opportunity zones I established the White House Opportunity and the Revitalization Council chaired by Secretary Carson. Ben’s worked very hard on it. Really hard. Its mission is to marshal 17 federal agencies and coordinate dozens of existing federal programs to provide maximum support to opportunity zones. Under my administration we’re working every day to restore the American promise of upward mobility. We don’t want anyone to just get by. We want everyone to get ahead and get ahead big league.
Donald Trump: (32:28)
From the day I took off, I have been working to build an unlimited future for African American communities who have given, served, and sacrificed so much for our nation. Tremendous, tremendous amount. I’ve been fighting for higher wages, fair trade deal, safe communities, affordable healthcare, lower drug prices. This year, meaning last year’s numbers just came in, first time in 51 years where drug prices, prescription drugs, went down. First time in 51 years. And frankly, if the Democrats would ever negotiate instead of wasting all their time, we could drive those prices down so low. It would be so beautiful. I mean, what’s not to like?
Donald Trump: (33:24)
We’re fighting for school choice and also criminal justice reform. You know, we got that done. Criminal justice reform. Big thing, we got it done. I will not rest, I will not stop, I will not give up until we have delivered equal and abundant opportunity for every community in our land. We are not interested… It’s true. No, we’re not interested in business as usual. We’re not interested in continuing yesterday’s failures, of which there were many, or the old ways of doing things. We want to disrupt what’s broken. I want to really disrupt this place because none of the other stuff work.
Donald Trump: (34:09)
When you look at the opportunity zones, how successful they’ve been, we’re doing things that are just really incredible. Now the economy’s helping I guess, and a lot of things are happening, a lot of good things are happening. But so many people are benefiting. We want to challenge what’s failed and focus on delivering real results, improving real lives, and making the world a better place for every American child no matter their place of birth or zip code or residence. No matter where they live, no matter where they come from.
Donald Trump: (34:39)
Our commitment to opportunity now includes those who have been released from prison. This is the first time where prisoners are coming out and getting jobs and not having to go back. The percentage is unbelievably different. To give former prisoners the chance for a fresh start, last year I was proud to sign the landmark criminal justice reform into law. Took a lot of work. It was a very tough one. They’ve been trying to get it for a long time and other administrations couldn’t get it. We got it done. We get things done.
Donald Trump: (35:23)
America is a nation that believes in redemption. People were in jail, you know Alice Johnson, she spent 22 years in jail. She had 18 or 20 left for something no good but not… It’s not a 40 or 50 year sentence. And she’s an incredible woman. You probably saw the ad we took at the Superbowl. I had another ad, we had two of them, and the first one was going to go in that spot. That was the best spot. That was right after the first time out. And this was one with jets and aircraft carriers and missiles all over the place. It was exciting. It was great. And I thought this was going to be just great.
Donald Trump: (36:11)
And then we had the Alice Johnson ad. So we played the first one and I have one guy in particular who’s a tremendously talented person, and everybody just assumed the missiles and the planes, that was going to be the ad. And then we’ll put Alice back a little bit further frankly and not in as good… You have two spots. You can get one great spot. One not so great spot. This guy comes in, looks at both ads, he says, “The Alice Johnson head is unbelievable.” I said, “What about the aircraft carriers?” He said, “It’s fine but, you know, I’ve seen them before. You do them all the time actually. Right?”
Donald Trump: (36:50)
And as soon as he said that I realized, and everybody is talking about that ad, Alice is a tremendous woman, tremendous person. And I said, “How many other women do you know in prison like that Alice?” She said many. I said, “Now do you know some that can’t come out?” Absolutely. Because I wanted to hear that too because that’s true also. But I said, “How many?” She said, “Many.” I said get me their names, just get me their name. She knows, she was in there a long time. 22 years she spent. A roaring economy is for the first time ever giving many former prisoners the ability to go out and get a great job. We’ve also made it a priority to encourage businesses to expand second chance hiring practices.
Donald Trump: (37:41)
When my administration says, “Hire American,” we mean all Americans, every American. To help former inmates find housing, jobs, and support, my administration has established the Council on Crime Prevention and Reentry. Very big deal. Today I’m proud to announce that I’m appointing Tony Loudon, pastor of Maranatha Baptist Church. Where’s Tony? In Georgia. Tony? Where is Tony? Come on Tony. And Tony’s going to be our executive director. Tony, tell us a little about your work, please. Thank you.
Tony Loudon: (38:24)
Thank you. To God be the glory. I truly want to thank our President from the bottom of my heart for signing this legislation. Too many of our men and women are ending up in our prisons and coming home with nothing to get back on their feet to. Too many of our children are ending up in our prisons. Too many of our people who are living with mental illness are finding themselves in our prisons. And here’s one for you. Too many of our soldiers come home with Old Glory on their shoulders, end up in our prisons, and we are better than that.
Tony Loudon: (39:09)
And so with this legislation that the President signed, now is the time to take this opportunity, rebuild our communities, and if you learn how to cut hair and cut grass and be an entrepreneur in prison, we’re going to give you a second chance. And we’re going to make sure you come home with your driver’s license, your ID, and your birth certificate so you can get back on your feet and be reunited with your family. Now is the time.
Tony Loudon: (39:55)
So with that, I encourage our faith-based organizations, our clergy, our businesses, our chamber of commerce and all our legislators, now is the time to get together and get behind this President. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (40:13)
Wow. He’s done that before. He’s some pastor. That’s what the word is. Now I understand. We’re grateful to you, pastor. Thank you very much. All of our countries, African American churches, have done such an incredible job. Everything they do, they really raise the spirit of our people, they lift up the conscience of our nation. And we really appreciate you being here. That was beautiful. Thank you very much. My administration will always defend the cherished legacy and vital contributions of our African American churches. They are so vital, so important. To make the most of America’s boundless opportunities every American child deserves a great education. Yet for too long, countless American children have been trapped in poorly performing schools. That’s why it’s one of those things I talked about in the State of the Union address.
Donald Trump: (41:32)
I highlighted the story of Janiah Davis, a fourth-grader from Philadelphia who was on the wait list for a School Choice Education Freedom Scholarship in Pennsylvania, along with 50,000 other Pennsylvania students. We got Janiah her second, really you call it a sort of a second chance. But we got her the school choice scholarship that she so desperately wanted with her mother. Her mother’s terrific. And now I want to ask Congress to pass legislation that would extend the same opportunity…
Donald Trump: (42:03)
Ask Congress to pass legislation that would extend the same opportunity to 1 million American children, including 40,000 students right here in this incredible state, this incredible place.
Donald Trump: (42:12)
Thank you. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (42:34)
School choice. We all like school choice, right? Every child has the right to attend a great school. That’s what it is. They have a right. It’s catching on like a people wouldn’t believe. In my State of the Union, I also asked Congress to support my plan to offer vocational and technical education at every single high school in America.
Donald Trump: (42:59)
We must be training our children so they have the skills to score well paying jobs, sometimes better paying than if they did it the traditional way. You know, when I was growing up, we had a lot of vocational schools and they’d teach auto mechanics and they’d teach brick laying and they teach all these great professions that make a lot of money. And I’d be in school with people and they didn’t love doing the traditional academics, but they could fix a car, an engine, a motor, they could fix it blind folded. They were unbelievably talented. They also liked doing it. That’s what they wanted to do. And we don’t really have that anymore. We call them junior colleges. And maybe that’s good, but I think the vocational school concept is what we really have to look at. They had tremendous talent. I’ll never forget. Tremendous talent.
Donald Trump: (43:49)
I sat next to a one very young person at the time. That’s what he loved, that’s what he wanted to do. He had no interest in what we were doing, just none. And I had no interest in what he was doing, you want to know the truth. But he was unbelievable. He could fix anything and that’s what you have to do. You have to go with the aptitude in addition to everything else and they have tremendous aptitude, but there’s no place. And so, we’re going to go with a vocational school system where they can go out, actually make more money, and have something they really want to do.
Donald Trump: (44:21)
My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background through our pledge to America’s workers spearheaded by a young woman that perhaps some of you may have heard of, Ivanka Trump.
Donald Trump: (44:43)
Over 415 companies have committed, these are the big companies for the most part, have committed to providing new jobs and training opportunities to nearly 15 million Americans. You know, when she started, she said, “Daddy, I want to help people get jobs.” This was at the beginning of the administration. She said, “I’m working on 500,000 jobs.” She’d call Walmart. She’d call all these great companies. She had a goal of 500,000, half a million jobs, sounds like a lot. I said, “That’s a lot.” She just broke 15 million jobs. Amazing. 15 million. And they’re not trained by government. Government can’t train them.
Donald Trump: (45:24)
Look at what happened. I mean, look at … I love the state of Iowa. We just did very well in Iowa, by the way. We set a record, but nobody talks about that. What they do talk about the fact is the Democrats don’t know what the hell they’re doing. It’s true. Mark just got back. You’ll have to see these campaigns. They’ll spend 20-25 million dollar, let’s say, on average, but it’s really more than that. And they go out, they work and they work, they’ve been campaigning there for weeks. They even had to leave the impeachment hearing. I said, keep them here, you’ll get a real fast settlement. But they couldn’t do.
Donald Trump: (46:06)
But, they go out and they work and they spend tens, millions, hundreds of millions of dollars, and the only thing they didn’t check to see whether or not the app worked. It didn’t. It fried all votes. They’re all fried. Now you have all these people fighting, “I was first,” “No, I was first.” They’re taking samples. They’re doing the vote by a sample. We got 2% of the vote, let’s see, who won. And it turned out to be Pete Buttigieg, who ever the hell that is, Mayor Pete. Explain that one to me. Someday you’ll go, “You’re going to explain that one to me, right?” Right? You people.
Donald Trump: (46:56)
Now, do you ever see anything so crazy? They can’t count simple votes, but they want to fix your healthcare system. Think of it. Remember the Obamacare, right? Remember? It was going to cost 5 million. It costs 5 billion, right? 5 billion. It still didn’t work. Still didn’t work. But they have something going on in Iowa that sad actually, if you want, it’s embarrassing. Although, I’m not overly embarrassed by it. I see these shows this morning, they’re saying, “Oh, this is a disaster. Trump is going to kill us on this one.” They’re right. They’re right. All that time. All that time.
Crowd: (47:49)
Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.
Donald Trump: (47:51)
Thank you. Now, if you want to drive them crazy, go 12 more years, 16 more years. They’ll drive them crazy. Look at all the fake news back there.
Donald Trump: (48:23)
To expand equal opportunity, I’m also proud to report that my administration has achieved record and permanent funding. This is so important. Every year, historically black colleges and universities, for three years now, they’d come and see me. We need money and after two years I said, how come they come back all the time? That’s not nice. That’s not respectful of them. No, really. I really mean it. You understand, right? It’s not respectful. They come back every year. They give them a one year, the Democrats, they give them one year and then you’re supposed to come back hat in hand. And what I did… I won’t get any credit for it… They’ll take the credit, but you know, it’s one of those things that happens all the time. Criminal justice reform.
Crowd: (49:08)
[inaudible 00:07:09]. Yes, all right.
Donald Trump: (49:33)
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That is nice. I think so. I think we’re getting… Look, hey, we are in the oval office so I guess something happened, right? But it is too with criminal justice reform, they couldn’t get it. Nobody could get it. And a group of people, including Van Jones and others, came to the oval office, they came with Jared Christian, smart kid, smart guy, and they came to the oval office and they said, “We can’t get it. We need help.” I said, “Who do you need help with?” Some very tough senators like Tom. No, they need help with some very tough people there are senators. They needed to get over the line. They needed numerous senators, Republican senators, that weren’t so inclined. We had some that absolutely right from the beginning. Ted Cruz, right from the beginning. Mike Lee, very conservative, right from the beginning. But they needed help. There was no way they could… It was dead.
Donald Trump: (50:33)
They came to see me, group of people headed by Van Jones, and they asked me for help. And I called six people and I explained it quickly and I got them to support it and it got passed. And you had another side that didn’t necessarily like it, but people are starting to like it now a lot because it’s fair. It’s just fair. And some states have done it. Texas has done it and Kentucky has done it. States that are known as being pretty tough on law and order.
Donald Trump: (51:14)
I got it done. And about a week later I saw Van Jones making the speech and he was thanking everybody. I called my wife, I said, “Darling, I’m so proud of this. Come in. I’m sure he’s going to say nice things.” He never mentioned my name. I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton. Al Sharpton, I didn’t even know he was involved. I want to thank people that I’d never even heard of. He was thanking people. He never mentioned my name. I had somebody call him say, you don’t have to do that, but if it’s so tough, not fair, but you know you should do it. He apologized. He said he made a mistake, but he could have never gotten done without me. And sometimes in life, and you have to do this, if you’re not going to get credit, you might as well take it yourself because you’re the only one that’s going to get it. It’s true. It’s true. Right? Might as well.
Donald Trump: (52:21)
You might as well take it yourself because they’re not going to give it to you. We’re very proud of it. But this was another one, historically black colleges and universities, and I said, it’s not fair. We put them down, as you know. Right? We put them down where they have long term. They don’t have to come back every year and beg. They don’t have to come back and beg every year. Right?
Donald Trump: (52:54)
You were one of the guys. You mentioned it to me. It was just unfair. These are great schools. These are school that do a phenomenal job. If we didn’t have those schools, it would be terrible. Now they have a longterm deal. They’ve got the money and they can focus on education, right? And most importantly, we’re going to ensure that the HBCUs will always be an important part of our educational system because we were going to lose a lot of them. They couldn’t do this, they just couldn’t do it. They were hiring consultants, wise guys, right? Real wise guys. They were hiring consultants, I call it, who get percentages, who get a lot of money to go to Washington and lobby and work and this and that, and a lot of the percentage of the time spent was on spending and seeing congressmen, seeing senators, seeing people. And I said, we can’t do this. And these consultants would say, “Hey, you got to give us something that paid the consultant.” It’s just a waste of money. They didn’t do anything. I never spoke to a consultant about what we’re talking about. Right? We have it, you’re done for longterm and that’s the way it’s going to be. And we might as well let you have, but I’m very proud of that one. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (54:18)
Previously federal law also restricted more than 40 faith-based HBCUs and seminars from fully accessing federal support, but my administration has stopped the federal government from discriminating against faith-based HBCUs and some of the best of them are faith-based. You know? Some of the best are faith-based. That’s a whole thing going on. It’s no good. I can’t do that.
Donald Trump: (55:02)
As part of our relentless campaign to make life better for working families, I’ve asked Congress to pass legislation extending family leave to new parents nationwide so that every parent can spend critical time with their newborn or newly adopted child. And we’ve also overseen historic funding increases for high quality childcare, enabling States to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their wait lists altogether. We have tremendous wait lists and those lists are way down. At the heart of our economic agenda is the conviction that for America to truly prosper, all of our communities must share in the gains. We’re making big gains and they have to share.
Donald Trump: (55:46)
Together we’re bringing opportunity back to the places that need it most. We’re honoring the allegiance to the hardworking men and women whose faith, love, sweat, and sacrifice, make our country run. We are restoring the bonds of loyalty that unite us as Americans. No matter your party, no matter your politics, we’re fighting to deliver freedom, justice, inequality to every man, woman, and child in our land. We’re fighting to bring opportunity, dignity, and hope to every block in every neighborhood, all throughout this magnificent nation, and it is indeed a magnificent nation. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (56:50)
With the help everyone here today, we are restoring the American dream for the American family. We’re giving a voice to those who were voiceless, and hope to those who felt hopeless. No part of this country will ever again be ignored, neglected, overlooked, or abandoned. We’re all united by a shared home, a shared destiny, and a shared devotion to our fellow citizens. We love our country. We are one American family.
Crowd: (57:20)
Love you.
Donald Trump: (57:20)
Thank you, darling. I love you too. She blew my best line, but would you stand up please. Where are you? I think you’re great. I love you too. Thank you very much. I was all set to really hit it, but I like that better.
Donald Trump: (57:43)
But, we’re one American family. We rise together, we thrive together, and we win together. And thank you very much to all of those for your work, your drive, your commitment, your patriotism, your love for this nation. Our future has never been brighter, and my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come. God bless you. Thank you, North Carolina. Thank you very much. God bless you all. Thank you."
"Feb 4, 2020","24, 2019
9:05 A.M. EST","Nancy Pelosi: (01:32)
Members of Congress, the President of the United States.
Audience : (01:37)
Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years. Four more years.
Donald Trump: (01:39)
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow citizens, three years ago we launched the great American comeback. Tonight I stand before you to share the incredible results. Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging and our country is thriving and highly respected again. America’s enemies are on the run. America’s fortunes are on the rise and America’s future is blazing bright. The years of economic decay are over. The days of our country being used, taken advantage of and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. Gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of American wealth, power, and prestige.
Donald Trump: (04:26)
In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of American’s destiny. We have totally rejected the downsizing. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never ever going back. I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. Our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world and it’s not even close. Our borders are secure. Our families are flourishing. Our values are renewed. Our pride is restored. And for all of these reasons I say to the people of our great country and to the members of Congress, the state of our union is stronger than ever before. The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world’s most prosperous and inclusive society. One where every citizen can join in America’s unparalleled success and where every community can take part in America’s extraordinary rise. From the instant I took office, I moved rapidly to revive the US economy, slashing a record number of job killing regulations, enacting historic and record setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. Our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and most of all pro-American. Thank you. We are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting our citizens of every race, color, religion and creed very, very high.
Donald Trump: (07:32)
Since my election, we have created 7 million new jobs, 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration. The unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century. And very incredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. If we hadn’t reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witnessing this great economic success. The unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Asian Americans has reached the lowest levels in history. African American youth unemployment has reached an all time low. African American poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.
Donald Trump: (09:36)
The unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years and last year women filled 72% of all new jobs added. The veteran’s unemployment rate dropped to a record low. The unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached an all time low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in US history. A record number of young Americans are now employed. Under the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. Under my administration, 7 million Americans have come off food stamps and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.
Donald Trump: (11:14)
In eight years, under the last administration, over 300,000 working age people dropped out of the workforce. In just three years of my administration, 3.5 million people, working age people, have joined the workforce. Since my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47%, three times faster than the increase for the top 1%. After decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast and wonderfully they are rising fastest for low income workers who have seen a 16% pay increase since my election. This is a blue collar boom. Real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded.
Donald Trump: (13:23)
Since my election, US stock markets have soared 70%, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation’s wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible. This is a record, it is something that every country in the world is looking up to, they admire. Consumer confidence has just reached amazing new highs. All of those millions of people with 401ks and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100% and even more. Jobs and investments are pouring into 9,000 previously neglected neighborhoods, thanks to Opportunity Zones, a plan spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott, as part of our great Republican tax cuts. In other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that haven’t seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy and excitement. This is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. It’s all working. Opportunity Zones are helping Americans like Army veteran, Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio. After struggling with drug addiction, Tony lost his job, his house and his family. He was homeless, but then Tony found a construction company that invests in Opportunity Zones. He is now a top tradesman, drug free, reunited with his family and he is here tonight. Tony, keep up the great work. Tony. Thank you Tony.
Donald Trump: (16:03)
Our roaring economy has for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. This second chance at life is made possible because we passed Landmark Criminal Justice Reform into law. Everybody said that criminal justice reform couldn’t be done, but I got it done and the people in this room got it done. Thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the United States has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far. With the tremendous progress we have made over the past three years, America is now energy independent and energy jobs, like so many other elements of our country, are at a record high. We are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just three years ago. Likewise, we are restoring our nations manufacturing might, even though predictions were, as you all know, that this could never ever be done. After losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, America has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration, with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or being built. Companies are not leaving, they are coming back to the USA. The fact is that everybody wants to be where the action is and the United States of America is indeed the place where the action is.
Donald Trump: (18:33)
One of the biggest promises I made to the American people was to replace the disastrous NAFTA trade deal. In fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for President. Following NAFTA as adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do so and then absolutely nothing happened. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. We did our job. Six days ago, I replaced NAFTA and signed the brand new United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement into law. The USMCA will create nearly 100,000 new high paying American auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers.
Donald Trump: (19:56)
It will also bring trade with Mexico and Canada to a much higher level. But also to be a much greater degree of fairness and reciprocity, we will have that fairness and reciprocity. And I say that finally, because it’s been many, many years that we were treated fairly on trade. This is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of America’s labor unions. I also promised our citizens that I would impose tariffs to confront China’s massive theft of America’s jobs. Our strategy has worked. Days ago we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with China, that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the USA. For decades, China has taken advantage of the United States. Now we have changed that, but at the same time we have perhaps the best relationship we’ve ever had with China, including with president Xi. They respect what we’ve done because quite frankly, they could never really believe that they were able to get away with what they were doing year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying, “That’s enough.” Now we want to rebuild our country and that’s exactly what we’re doing. We are rebuilding our country. As we restore American leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. That’s why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on Cuba. We are supporting the hopes of Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans to restore democracy. The United States is leading a 59 nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro. Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people, but Maduro’s grip tyranny will be smashed and broken.
Donald Trump: (23:13)
Here this evening, is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate President of Venezuela, Juan Guido, Mr. President, please take this message back to your opponent. Thank you, Mr. President, a great honor. Thank you very much. Please take this message back that all Americans are United with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. Thank you very much Mr. President. Thank you very much. Socialism destroys nations, but always remember freedom unifies the soul.
Donald Trump: (24:58)
To safeguard American liberty, we have invested a record breaking $2.2 trillion in the United States military. We have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rocket ships, and every other form of military equipment and it’s all made right here in the USA. We’re also getting our allies finally, to help pay their fair share. I have raised contributions from other NATO members by more than $400 billion and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled. And just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand new branch of the United States armed forces. It’s called the Space Force. It’s very important.
Donald Trump: (26:47)
In the gallery tonight, we have a young gentleman and what he wants so badly… 13 years old, Iain Lanphier. He’s an eighth grader from Arizona. Iain, please stand up. Iain has always dreamed of going to space. He was the first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. He aspires to go to the Air Force Academy and then he has his eye on the Space Force. As Iain says, “Most people look up at space. I want to look down on the world.” But sitting behind Iain tonight is his greatest hero of them all, Charles McGee, who was born in Cleveland Ohio, one century ago. Charles is one of the last surviving Tuskegee airman, the first black fighter pilots, and…
Donald Trump: (28:03)
Eggy Airman, the first black fighter pilots, and he also happens to be Ian’s great grandfather. Incredible story. After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam. On December 7th Charles celebrated his 100th birthday. A few weeks ago, I signed a bill promoting Charles McGee to Brigadier General. And earlier today I pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office. General McGee, our nation salutes you. Thank you sir. From the pilgrims to the founders, from the soldiers at Valley Forge to the marchers at Selma and from President Lincoln to the Reverend Martin Luther King, Americans have always rejected limits on our children’s future. Members of Congress we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people.
Donald Trump: (30:54)
The people are the heart of our country. Their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. We must always remember that our job is to put America first.
Donald Trump: (31:26)
The next step forward and building an inclusive society is making sure that every young American gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the American dream. Yet, for too long, countless American children have been trapped in failing government schools. To rescue these students 18 States have created school choice in the form of opportunity scholarships. The programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on a waiting list. One of those students is Jenaya Davis, a fourth grader from Philadelphia, Jenaya.
Donald Trump: (32:24)
Jenaya’s mom Stephanie is a single parent. She would do anything to give her daughter a better future, but last year that future was put further out of reach when Pennsylvania’s governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children. Jenaya and Stephanie are in the gallery. Stephanie, thank you so much for being here with your beautiful daughter. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (32:53)
But Jenaya I have some good news for you because I am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. I can proudly announced tonight that an opportunity scholarship has become available. It’s going to you and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice. Now I call on Congress to give one million American children the same opportunity, Jenaya has just received. Pass the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act because no parents should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.
Donald Trump: (34:22)
Every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and to grow. For this reason, our magnificent first lady has launched The Be Best initiative to advance a safe, healthy, supportive and drug free life for the next generation online in school and in our communities. Thank you, Melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for America’s children. Thank you very much. My administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. Through our pledge to American workers over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million Americans. My budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation’s high schools. Tonight, I ask Congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in America. To expand equal opportunity, I am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation’s historically black colleges and universities. A good life for American families also requires the most affordable, innovative and high quality healthcare system on earth. Before I took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just five years. I moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. Our new plans are up to 60% less expensive and better. I’ve also made an Ironclad Pledge to American families. We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security, always.
Donald Trump: (37:44)
The American patients should never be blindsided by medical bills. That is why I signed an executive order requiring price transparency. Many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year will be even bigger than healthcare reform. It will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care, but as we work to improve Americans health care, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. 132 lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million very happy Americans. To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know we will never let socialism destroy American healthcare.
Donald Trump: (39:05)
Over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. These proposals would raid the Medicare benefits of our seniors and that our seniors depend on while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. That is what is happening in California and other States. Their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. If forcing American taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal alien sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical Left. But if you believe that we should defend American patients and American seniors then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens.
Donald Trump: (40:25)
This will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded Southern border where as we speak, a long, tall and very powerful wall is being built. We have now completed over 100 miles and have over 500 miles fully completed in a very short period of time. Early next year we will have substantially more than 500 miles completed. My administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. We have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs and medicines are being approved by the FDA at a faster clip than ever before.
Donald Trump: (41:35)
And I was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years, the costs of prescription drugs actually went down. And working together Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. I’ve been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done and done quickly and properly. I’m calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill on my desk and I will sign it into law immediately. With unyielding commitment we are curbing the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. Among the States hardest hit Ohio is down 22%, Pennsylvania is down 18%, Wisconsin is down 10%, and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.
Donald Trump: (43:39)
Protecting Americans health also means fighting infectious diseases. We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the Corona virus outbreak in China. My administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat. We have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for Americans with kidney disease, Alzheimer’s, and those struggling with mental health. And because Congress was so good as to fund my request, new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the AIDS epidemic in America by the end of this decade.
Donald Trump: (44:23)
Almost every American family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. Here tonight is a special man, beloved by millions of Americans who just received a stage four advanced cancer diagnosis. This is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. Rush Limbaugh, thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. And Rush in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and that you inspire and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity I am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country’s highest civilian honor, The Presidential Medal of Freedom. I will now ask the first lady of the United States to present you with the honor. Please. Rush and Catherine, congratulations. Thank you, Catherine.
Donald Trump: (48:05)
As we pray for all who are sick, we know that America is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. In 2017 doctors at Saint Luke’s Hospital in Kansas City delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. Born at just 21 weeks and six days and weighing less than a pound, Ellie Schneider was a born fighter. Through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents, little Ellie kept on winning the battle of life. Today Ellie is a strong, healthy two year old girl sitting with her amazing mother, Robin in the gallery, Ellie and Robin we’re glad to have you with us tonight. Ella reminds us that every child is a miracle of life and thanks to modern medical wonders. 50% of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where Ellie was born now survive. It’s an incredible thing. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (49:38)
Our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like Ellie. That is why I’m asking Congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neonatal research for America’s youngest patients. That is why I’m also calling upon members of Congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late term abortion of babies.
Donald Trump: (50:17)
Whether we are Republican, Democrat, or Independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from God. As we support America’s moms and dads, I was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce, paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. Now, I call on Congress to pass the bipartisan advancing Support for Working Families Act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across our nation. 40 million American families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit.
Donald Trump: (51:47)
I’ve also overseen historic funding increases for high quality childcare, enabling 17 States to help more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their wait lists altogether. And I sent Congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high quality childcare and urge you to act immediately.
Donald Trump: (52:22)
To protect the environment, days ago I announced that the United States will join the 1 Trillion Tree Initiative and ambitious effort to bring together government and private sector to plant new trees in America and all around the world.
Donald Trump: (52:55)
We must also rebuild America’s infrastructure. I asked you to pass Senator John Barrasso’s Highway Bill to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels all across our land. I’m also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high speed Internet, including and especially in rural America. A better tomorrow for all Americans also requires us to keep America safe. That means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our nation’s heroic ICE officers.
Donald Trump: (54:16)
Last year, our brave ICE officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2000 murders. Tragically, there are many cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. In sanctuary cities local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed. Just 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of New York was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92 year old woman. The killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under New York sanctuary policies, he was set free. If the city had honored ICE’s detainer requests, his victim would still be alive today.
Donald Trump: (55:25)
The state of California passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants, a very terrible sanctuary with catastrophic results. Here is just one tragic example. In December, 2018 California police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault, but as required by California sanctuary law, local authorities released him. Days later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He…
Donald Trump: (56:03)
Ellian went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. He viciously shot one man going about his daily work. He approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and in the chest. He walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. He hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. One of the victims is a terrible, terrible situation, died 51-year-old American named Rocky Jones. Rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range murdering him and cold blood.
Donald Trump: (56:46)
Rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything else in the world. One of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. Jody, would you please stand? Jody? Thank you.
Donald Trump: (57:18)
Jody, our hearts weep for your lost and we will not rest until you have justice. Senator Thom Tillis has introduced legislation to allow Americans like Jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly practices.
Donald Trump: (57:47)
I asked Congress to pass the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act immediately. The United States of America should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal alien.
Donald Trump: (58:00)
In the last three years, ICE has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers and I have side nine pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking domestically and all around the globe. My administration has undertaken and unprecedented effort to secure the Southern border of the United States
Donald Trump: (58:40)
Before I came into office, if you showed up illegally on our Southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country never to be seen again. My administration has ended catch and release.
Donald Trump: (58:55)
If you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed from our country.
Donald Trump: (59:17)
Very importantly, we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. As a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75% since May dropping eight straight months in a row.
Donald Trump: (59:36)
And as the wall rapidly goes up, drug seizures rise and the border crossings are going down and going down very rapidly. Last year, I traveled to the border in Texas and met Chief Patrol Agent Raul Ortiz. Over the last 24 months, Agent Ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisoners narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. Days ago, Agent Ortiz was promoted to deputy chief of border patrol and he joins us tonight. Chief Ortiz, please stand.
Donald Trump: (01:00:52)
A grateful nation thanks you and all of the heroes of border patrol and ICE. Thank you very much. Thank you. To build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.
Donald Trump: (01:01:19)
With every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and reasserting the culture of American freedom.
Donald Trump: (01:01:39)
Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, thank you, Mitch, and his colleagues in the Senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. This includes two brilliant new Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Thank you. And we have many in the pipeline.
Donald Trump: (01:02:38)
My administration is also defending religious liberty and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools.
Donald Trump: (01:02:57)
In America, we don’t punish prayer. We don’t tear down crosses. We don’t band symbols of faith. We don’t muzzle preachers and pastors. In America, we celebrate faith, we cherish religion. We lift our voices in prayer and we raise our sights to the glory of God. Just as we believe in the first amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. So long as I am president, I will always protect your second amendment right to keep and bear arms.
Donald Trump: (01:03:52)
In reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that America has always been a frontier nation. Now we must embrace the next frontier, America’s manifest destiny in the stars. I am asking Congress to fully fund the Artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be American astronauts using this as a launching pad to ensure that America is the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.
Donald Trump: (01:04:27)
My administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical Islamic terrorism.
Donald Trump: (01:04:45)
Last week, I announced the groundbreaking plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the chance to realize a better future. Three years ago, the barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and Syria. Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100% destroyed and the founder and leader of ISIS, the bloodthirsty killer known as al-Baghdadi is dead.
Donald Trump: (01:05:52)
We are joined this evening by Carl and Marcia Mueller. After graduating from college, their beautiful daughter Kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. She once wrote, some people find God in church. Some people find God in nature. Some people find God in love. I find God in suffering. I’ve known for some time what my life’s work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering. In 2013 while caring for suffering civilians in Syria, Kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by ISIS and kept as a prisoner of al-Baghdadi himself.
Donald Trump: (01:06:36)
After more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-Baghdadi murdered young, beautiful Kayla. She was just 26-years-old. On the night that US Special Forces operations ended al-Baghdadi’s miserable life, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff General Mark Milley received a call in the situation room. He was told that the brave men of the elite special forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name task force 814. It was a reference to a special day, August 14, Kayla’s birthday. Carl and Marsha, America’s warriors never forgot Kayla and neither will we. Thank you. Every day, America’s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depth of love that dwells in the human heart. One of these American heroes was Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake. On his second deployment to Iraq in 2008, Sergeant Hake wrote a letter to his one-year-old son, Gage, I will be with you again. He wrote to gage. I will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sandbox, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. I love you son. Take care of your mother. I am always with you. Daddy.
Donald Trump: (01:08:43)
On Easter Sunday of 2008, Chris was out on patrol in Baghdad when his Bradley fighting vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. That night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Sergeant Hake now rests in eternal glory in Arlington and his wife Kelly is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now a 13-year-old and doing very, very well. To Kelly and Gage, Chris will live in our hearts forever. He’s looking down on you now. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:09:45)
Thank you very much. Thank you both very much. The terrorist responsible for killing Sergeant Hake was Qasem Soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took Chris’s life. Soleimani was the Iranian regime’s most ruthless butcher, a monster who murder or wounded thousands of American service members in Iraq. As the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women and children. He directed the December assault and went on to assault US forces in Iraq, was actively planning new attacks when we hit him very hard. And that’s why last month at my direction, the US military executed a flawless precision strike that killed Soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.
Donald Trump: (01:10:58)
Our message to the terrorists is clear. You will never escape American justice. If you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life. In recent months, we have seen prouder radians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. The Iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. Because of our powerful sanctions, the Iranian economy is doing very, very poorly. We can help them make a very good and short time recovery.
Donald Trump: (01:11:50)
It can all go very quickly, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. We are here. Let’s see which road they choose. It is totally up to them.
Donald Trump: (01:12:02)
As we defend American lives, we are working to end America’s Wars in the Middle East. In Afghanistan, the determination and valor of our war fighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress and peace talks are now underway. I am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Afghanistan, many of them totally innocent. It is also not our function to serve other nations as law enforcement agencies. These are war fighters that we have, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all.
Donald Trump: (01:12:50)
We are working to finally end America’s longest war and bring our troops back home. War places a heavy burden on our nation’s extraordinary military families, especially spouses like Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, North Carolina and her two children, six-year-old Eliana and three-year-old Rowan. Amy works full time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. For the past seven months, she has done it all while her husband’s Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams is in Afghanistan on his fourth deployment in the Middle East. Amy’s kids haven’t seen their father’s face in many months.
Donald Trump: (01:13:45)
Amy, your family’s sacrifice makes possible for all of our families to live in safety and in peace and we want to thank you. Thank you, Amy. But, Amy, there is one more thing. Tonight, we have a very special surprise. I am thrilled to inform you that your husband is back from deployment. He is here with us tonight and we couldn’t keep him waiting any longer.
Audience: (01:14:32)
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.
Donald Trump: (01:16:14)
Welcome home, Sergeant Williams. Thank you very much. As the world bears witness tonight, America is a land of heroes. There’s a place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged and where legends come to life. This is the home of Thomas Edison and Teddy Roosevelt, of many great generals including Washington, Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur. This is the home of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Amelia Earhart, Harriet Tubman, the Wright brothers, Neil Armstrong, and so many more. This is the country where children learn names like Wyatt Earp, Davy Crockett and Annie Oakley. This is the place where the pilgrims landed at Plymouth and where Texas patriots made their last stand at the Alamo. The beautiful, beautiful Alamo. The American nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth. Our ancestors braved the unknown, tamed the wilderness, settled the wild West, lifted millions from poverty, disease and hunger, vanquished tyranny and fascism, ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine, laid down the railroads, dug out the canals, raised up the skyscrapers and ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history and we are making it greater than ever before. This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance. We are Americans. We are pioneers. We are the pathfinders. We settled the new world. We built the modern world and we change history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of almighty God. America is the place where anything can happen. America is the place where anyone can rise. And here on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true. This nation is our canvas and this country is our masterpiece. We look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. Our brightest discoveries are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories are not yet told. Our grandest journeys are not yet made. The American age, the American epic, the American adventure has only just begun.
Donald Trump: (01:20:02)
Our spirit is still young. The sun is still rising. God’s grace is still shining. And my fellow Americans, the best is yet to come. Thank you, God bless you and God bless America. Thank you very much."
"Jan 24, 2020",11:43 A.M. EST,"Donald Trump: (02:07)
Well, thank you very much and thank you Jeanie. It is my profound honor to be the first President in history to attend the March for Life. We’re here for a very simple reason, to defend the right of every child born and unborn, to fulfill their God-given potential. For 47 years, Americans of all backgrounds have traveled from across the country to stand for life. And today as President of the United States, I am truly proud to stand with you. I want to welcome tens of thousands. This is a tremendous turnout. Tens of thousands of high school and college students who took long bus rides to be here in our Nation’s Capitol.
Donald Trump: (03:16)
And to make you feel even better, there are tens of thousands of people outside that we passed on the way in. If anybody would like to give up their spot, we can work that out. We have a tremendous group of people outside, thousands and thousands wanting to get in. This is some great success. Young people are the heart of the March for Life and it’s your generation that is making America the pro-family, pro-life nation. The life movement is led by strong women, amazing faith leaders, and brave students who carry on the legacy of pioneers before us who fought to raise the conscience of our nation and uphold the rights of our citizens.
Donald Trump: (04:10)
You embrace mothers with care and compassion. You are powered by prayer and motivated by pure, unselfish love. You are grateful and we are so grateful. These are incredible people. To be joined by Secretary Alex Azar and Kellyanne Conway. Thank you. And thanks also to Senators Mike Lee and James Lankford, who are here. James, Mike. Thank you, fellows. And Representatives, Steve Scalise, Chris Smith, Ralph Abraham, Warren Davidson, Bob Latta, John Joyce, Lloyd Smucker, Brian Fitzpatrick, and Brad Wenstrup. Thank you all. And I have to say, and I look at it, I see it exactly. We have many, many more politicians in the audience. But if you don’t mind, I won’t introduce them all.
Donald Trump: (05:27)
All of us here today understand an eternal truth, every child is a precious and sacred gift from God. Together we must protect, cherish, and defend the dignity and the sanctity of every human life. When we see the image of a baby in the womb, we glimpse the majesty of God’s creation. When we hold a newborn in our arms, we know the endless love that each child brings to a family. When we watch a child grow, we see the splendor that radiates from each human soul. One life changes the world. From my family, and I can tell you I send love and I send great, great love. And from the first day in office, I’ve taken historic action to support America’s families and to protect the unborn.
Donald Trump: (06:31)
And during my first week in office, I reinstated and expanded the Mexico City policy and we issued a landmark pro-life rule to govern the use of title 10 taxpayer funding. I notified Congress that I would veto any legislation that weakens pro-life policies or that encourages the destruction of human life. At the United Nations, I made clear that global bureaucrats have no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that protect innocent life. Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House. And as the Bible tells us, each person is wonderfully made. We’ve taken decisive action to protect the religious liberty. So important. Religious liberty has been under attack all over the world and frankly very strongly attacked in our nation.
Donald Trump: (07:55)
You see it better than anyone, but we are stopping it and we’re taking care of doctors, nurses, teachers and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor. We are preserving faith-based adoption and to uphold our founding documents. We have confirmed 187 federal judges who apply the Constitution as written, including two phenomenal Supreme Court Justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. We are protecting pro-life students’ right to free speech on college campuses. And if universities want federal taxpayer dollars, then they must uphold your 1st Amendment right to speak your mind. And if they don’t, they pay a very big financial penalty, which they will not be willing to pay.
Donald Trump: (09:06)
Sadly, the far left is actively working to erase our God-given rights. Shut down faith-based charities, ban religious believers from the public square, and silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life. They are coming after me because I am fighting for you and we are fighting for those who have no voice and we will win because we know how to win. We all know how to win. We all know how to win. You’ve been winning for a long time. You’ve been winning for a long time. Together we are the voice for the voiceless. When it comes to abortion, Democrats … And you know this. You’ve seen what’s happened. Democrats have embraced the most radical and extreme positions taken and seen in this country for years and decades and you could even say for centuries.
Donald Trump: (10:17)
Nearly every top Democrat in Congress now supports taxpayer-funded abortion all the way up until the moment of birth. Last year, lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother’s womb right up until delivery. Then we had the case of the Democrat Governor in the state of Virginia, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and we love the Commonwealth of Virginia. But what is going on in Virginia? What is going on? The Governor stated that he would execute a baby after birth. You remember that. Senate Democrats even blocked legislation that would give medical care to babies who survive attempted abortions.
Donald Trump: (11:22)
And that’s why I’ve called on Congress, two of our great senators here, so many of our Congressman here. I called upon them to defend the dignity of life and to pass legislation prohibiting late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in their mother’s womb. This year, the March for Life is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which forever enshrined women’s rights to vote in the United States and given by the United States Constitution. Such a big event. Today, millions of extraordinary women across America are using the power of their votes to fight for the right and all of their rights as given in the Declaration of Independence, the right to life.
Donald Trump: (12:23)
To all the women here today, your devotion and your leadership uplifts our entire nation and we thank you for that. The tens of thousands of Americans gathered today not only stand for life, it’s really here that they stand for it so proudly together and I want to thank everybody for that. You stand for life each and every day. You provide housing, education, jobs, and medical care to the women that you serve. You find loving families for children in need of a forever home. You host baby showers for expecting moms. You just make it your life’s mission to help spread God’s grace. And to all of the moms here today, we celebrate you and we declare that mothers are heroes. That’s true. Your strength, devotion, and drive is what powers our nation. And because of you, our country has been blessed with amazing souls who have changed the course of human history.
Donald Trump: (13:41)
We cannot know what our citizens yet unborn will achieve, the dreams they will imagine, the masterpieces they will create, the discoveries they will make. But we know this, every life brings love into this world. Every child brings joy to a family. Every person is worth protecting. And above all, we know that every human soul is divine and every human life, born and unborn, is made in the holy image of Almighty God. Together we will defend this truth all across our magnificent land. We will set free the dreams of our people and with determined hope, we look forward to all of the blessings that will come from the beauty, talent, purpose, nobility, and grace of every American child. I want to thank you. This is a very special moment. It’s so great to represent you. I love you all. And I say with true passion, thank you, God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you all. Thank you."
"Jan 22, 2020",1:49 P.M. EST,"Donald Trump: (00:01)
Unemployment rates among African American, Hispanic American, Asian Americans has reached a record low in the history of our country, the lowest. African American youth unemployment has reached the lowest in the history of our country. So proud of that. African American poverty numbers have plummeted to their lowest rate ever recorded, doing really well. Unemployment rate for women has reached the lowest level in almost 70 years, and the veterans’ unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Unemployment rate for disabled Americans has reached its all time record low, also. These are incredible numbers [inaudible 00:00:44]. Workers without a high school diploma have received the and achieved the lowest unemployment rate ever in recorded history. That’s so important, without a high school diploma. We have a lot of great people that don’t have a high school diploma. We have record low unemployment. A record number of young Americans are now employed.
Donald Trump: (01:11)
We have the highest number of people working in our country that we’ve ever had before. We’ve never had anything even close. We’re almost up to 160 million, and we’ve lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and you know all about food stamps. We talk about it all the time, but millions and millions of people don’t need food stamps anymore. Sad that we’ve lifted them off, which we have, but they don’t need them anymore. They have jobs. They’re doing really well.
Donald Trump: (01:37)
The U.S. stock markets have soared, and they’ve reached the highest point that they’ve ever, ever had. We’ve made at least $19 trillion in terms of wealth, in terms of wealth creation for our country beyond the stock markets, and we are now, by far, the biggest economy in the world. China would have caught us. They were getting very close. It was anticipated that in 2019 … This is for many years. I’m not telling any secrets, that by 2019, China would become the largest economy in the world. Right now, we’re much larger, but we have a great new deal with China, great deal.
Donald Trump: (02:18)
We have, I would say, our best relationship that we’ve ever had with China on top of everything else, and we’re starting phase two. Phase one turned out to be much bigger than we anticipated because we have intellectual property protections, we have many of the financial deals and aspects of the financial deals that we wanted we got done, and other things, in addition to the farmers. We’ve got the total complete package for the farmers. We estimate that it’ll be anywhere between 40 and $50 billion. The number I think is going to be closer to 50 billion. The most they’ve ever done is 16, so we go from 16 to anywhere from 40 to 50 billion that they’ll be purchasing.
Donald Trump: (03:03)
We’re an economic powerhouse like, actually, we’ve never been. Jobs, factories, companies are pouring back into the United States. That’s one of the reasons I’ve been in Davos is we have had conversations with other leaders of other countries where we’ve traditionally had tremendous deficits. I say, “You have to move factories and plants back here.” They took a lot of them. They actually took a lot of them, and now they’re going to move them back. They’re not going to move them back. The companies are coming back because everybody wants to be here, but the countries also understand that we have to balance out our trade, and we’re doing incredibly well in that way.
Donald Trump: (03:40)
One of the people that was very important for me to meet from the World Trade Organization is Roberto Azevedo, and he is a highly respected man. He happens to be this gentleman right here. I thought I’d have him say a few words, but the World Trade Organization is … I’ve had a dispute running with them for quite a while because our country hasn’t been treated fairly.
Donald Trump: (04:04)
China’s viewed as a developing nation. India is viewed as a developing nation. We’re not viewed as a developing nation. As far as I’m concerned, we’re a developing nation, too, but they got tremendous advantages by the fact that they were considered developing, and we weren’t, and they shouldn’t be, but if they are, we are, and we’re talking about a whole new structure for the deal, or we’ll have to do something, but the World Trade Organization’s been very unfair to the United States for many, many years, and without it, China wouldn’t be China. China wouldn’t be where they are right now. That was the vehicle that they used, and I give them great credit, and I also don’t give the people that were in my position great credit because, frankly, they let that all happen, but the vehicle was the World Trade Organization.
Donald Trump: (04:55)
Roberto and I have a tremendous relationship, and we’re going to do something that I think will be very dramatic. He’ll be coming with a lot of his representatives to Washington sometime, maybe next week or the week after, and we’ll start working on it. I’d like to introduce just for briefly Roberto and say a few words on behalf of the WTO, and then I’m going to introduce Larry Kudlow to say exactly where we are in terms of our economy. Some of you know, but we’ve had some tremendous numbers just over the very recent past. So please, Roberto.
Roberto Azevedo: (05:31)
Well, thank you, Mr. President. I think it’s fair to say that we have been saying for quite some time that if the multilateral system, if the WTO, is to deliver its and perform its role in today’s global economy, it has to be updated, it has to be changed, it has to be reformed. This is an agenda that is squarely before members. I don’t think anybody in Geneva misses the point. I think they understand that the system has not been functioning properly in many areas. That’s something that we are trying to address.
Roberto Azevedo: (06:06)
I’m very happy that, in the conversation today with President Trump, he agreed that this is something that needs to happen. The WTO has to change. We are committed to effect those changes and this is something that we’re serious about, and I am going to be, together with President Trump, as soon as possible discussing what needs to change, what needs to be effected in the WTO, and we are committed to doing that. Of course, I will be talking to all the other WTO members, making sure that they all understand that this is serious. This is a path that we all have to be on together if we want to make the WTO relevant and performing to today’s requirements, frankly. Thank you very much, Mr. President. It’s an honor to be with you and with everybody else. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (06:55)
Thank you very much. Great.
Roberto Azevedo: (06:55)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (06:59)
Larry, please, Larry Kudlow.
Larry Kudlow: (07:00)
Thank you, sir. I think we’re coming into the new year with a lot of positive momentum in the economy. Again, I want to repeat what President’s speech yesterday. These are transformational free enterprise policies, lower tax rates across the board, deregulation, energy independence, and breaking down trade barriers for better deals for exporting. Just recently, we’ve seen all the confidence surveys are strong, consumer confidence, business confidence, small business confidence. The huge stock market rally, which continues, is I believe a sign of business and consumer confidence and predicting an even stronger economy in 2020. Also, lately, housing markets are very strong. We’ve seen some huge numbers in new housing starts and existing and new home sales. That’s a great omen. It’s a leading indicator, and even with softness and manufacturing last year, we’re seeing now the IHS market surveys for PMI manufacturing up four straight months for the U.S., and I think that’s a terrific sign of a comeback.
Larry Kudlow: (08:10)
I think the President’s trade deals have inspired a lot of confidence among large and small businesses, and I think it’s going to add at least a half a point to GDP this year. I think we’re going to be moving into the 3% zone. We still have to cope with the slow down in Boeing. We’ll see how that plays out, but I think USMCA and the China deals are going to add a lot to growth this year and the years ahead. The great part about this, to me, I’ve been around for a while, is when you look inside, look under the hood, in this growth spurt, with three and a half percent unemployment and virtually no inflation, which itself is a remarkable development, it is the American middle class, it is the American blue collar middle class, they have the fastest wage growth, and, in fact, the lower wage folks are getting the fastest wage increases, exceeding significantly, but from what their managers are making.
Larry Kudlow: (09:13)
I would add also, as the President has indicated, in this stock market rally, I know it’s commonplace to say it only helps if you’re rich people. That is just not true. Over half the households in this country own shares through 401ks and IRAs and brokerage accounts and so forth. You look at the numbers, and the CEA just published a great slide book on this, the bottom 50% has had a 47% increase in their net wealth, consumer net wealth, between home prices and share prices, and that is a booster rocket to this economy. It not only gives them confidence, it gives them some serious spending power, and the consumer spending numbers bear it out. Ours is an optimistic message, and I think the President really carried the day in his speech yesterday. Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (10:05)
Thank you very much, Larry. I mean, when you think that soon, it’ll start pretty soon, it’s already started to a certain extent, I asked him to do it, china is going to be purchasing more than $250 billion worth of goods from our country. That’s massive. Those are numbers that nobody’s ever heard of before, and that number can grow. It can grow with time. It’s going to grow substantially, I predict. Then, you have the USMCA, Mexico, Canada, and that’s massive numbers we’re talking about there. We made a deal with Japan, $40 billion, and we made a deal with South Korea. That’s a tremendous deal, also. That was a horrible deal. We turned it into a really good deal. It was really something.
Donald Trump: (10:51)
While we were in Davos, most of you know this, we met with the world leaders, various world leaders, including the President of the European Commission, who we’re going to start negotiating a trade deal with, because the European commission was, frankly, in many ways, tougher than China. I say that respectfully, but that’s the way it is. They’ve taken advantage for a long time, and so we’re going to have a deal. I suspect we’re going to be able to make a deal. Otherwise, we’ll have to do something else. I think they’re going to make a deal. They haven’t wanted to negotiate with past Presidents, but they’re going to negotiate with me. The President of the Swiss Confederation, who’s been very nice and terrific, the President of Kurdistan, we had a tremendous meeting along, with President Salih of Iraq, the Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan, and President Ghani of Afghanistan. In addition, we met with many of the business leaders both at breakfast today and lunch yesterday and dinner yesterday. Many of you were at those meetings at least for a little while, and tremendous numbers of jobs will be coming into the United States. A lot of these leaders, these are the biggest business leaders in the world, and this morning was very inspirational. I mean, these companies are really going to expand, and it was a request of mine, but what we did, we’ve been very good to them. They’re all doing very well, and we have companies from Europe, companies from Asia now coming to the United States. “That’s where the action is,” as one of them said, ” that’s where the action is.” It’s really been great. Now, we’ll be going. We’ll be leaving and going back to Washington. Yes?
Speaker 1: (12:40)
Mr. President, [inaudible 00:12:42].
Donald Trump: (12:41)
Go ahead.
Speaker 1: (12:44)
Mr. President, do you want to hear from witnesses in the impeachment trial? Your team has been a little inconsistent on this [crosstalk 00:12:49].
Donald Trump: (12:49)
Well, I’ll tell you the way I look at it. It’s a total hoax. It’s a disgrace. They talked about their tremendous case, and it’s all done, their tremendous case. They had no case. It’s all a hoax. It’s a con job, like Schiff. He’s a corrupt politician. Now, I’ll leave that to the Senate. The Senate is going to have to answer that. I have great respect for the Senate as a body, and many of the individuals I have great respect, so I’ll leave that to the Senate, but this is the greatest witch hunt.
Donald Trump: (13:19)
This started from the day I came down with the future First Lady. The day we came down the escalator, this started, and I watched the … They’ve been driven crazy. You know what’s driven them crazy? All of these record numbers on unemployment, African American, Asian American. You take a look. Hispanic American is numbers that nobody’s even believing. They are looking at all of this. They’re looking at this tremendous success, the likes of which they’ve never seen before in this country. They’ve never seen anything like this, and it’s driven the Democrats crazy. As Congressman Green said, Al Green, he’s a beauty. As Congressman green said, “We got to beat him by impeachment because we can’t beat him in the election.” I hope that’s-
Donald Trump: (14:03)
… Because we can’t beat them in the election. And I hope that’s true, because honestly, they can’t beat me in the election. I don’t think they can. I know what I’ll be running against one way or the other. It’s one of them and I think we’re going to do very well, but I think we’re going to do well because nobody’s done in the first three years, less than three years, because a lot of these numbers were taken from two months ago. They ended two months ago. In less than three years, nobody’s done the kind of numbers we’ve done. So I’m going to head back and I’ll be watching it, but it’s really going to be up to the Senate. We’re going to have them make that determination. Please. [inaudible 00:14:37] Please.
Speaker 2: (14:38)
Yes, Mr. President. You were the keynote speaker here, but you shared some of the spotlight with a Scandinavian teenager, Greta Thunberg, who you had said needs to work on her anger. She had some very harsh words-
Donald Trump: (14:54)
I didn’t say anger, I said anger management.
Speaker 2: (14:55)
Anger mangagement, yes sir. She had some very strong words here that the United States and other industrialized countries need to do more. Do you still feel that you’re doing enough? [crosstalk 00:00:15:08]-
Donald Trump: (15:09)
How old is she?
Speaker 2: (15:10)
She’s-
Journalists: (15:11)
17.
Speaker 2: (15:12)
17 now. Yes.
Donald Trump: (15:13)
That’s good.
Speaker 2: (15:14)
But what is your response to her-
Donald Trump: (15:16)
She beat me out on Time Magazine.
Speaker 2: (15:18)
Did you hear from other world leaders and business leaders who said that they think that she has a message that [crosstalk 00:15:24]-
Donald Trump: (15:24)
No, I didn’t actually. But I would’ve loved to have seen her speak. I did [crosstalk 00:15:30] not. No, not at all. I think what is … I think aspects of it are, I think that some people are … They put it at a level that is unrealistic, to a point you can’t live your lives. We want to have the cleanest water on earth. We want to have the cleanest air on earth. Our numbers, as you saw, we had record numbers come out very recently. Our numbers are very, very good. Our environmental numbers, our water numbers, our numbers on air are tremendous. We have to do something about other continents. We have to do something about other countries. When we’re clean and beautiful and everything’s good, but you have another continent where the fumes are rising at levels that you can’t believe. I mean, I think Greta ought to focus on those places, but we are doing better right now than we’ve ever done in terms of cleanliness, in terms of numbers. We have a beautiful ocean called the Pacific Ocean with thousands and thousands of tons of garbage flows toward us and that’s put there by other countries. So I think Greta has to start working on those other countries.
Speaker 3: (16:35)
Mr. President [crosstalk 00:16:35].
Donald Trump: (16:37)
By the way, congratulations on your show.
Speaker 3: (16:40)
Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (16:41)
They made a very wise decision.
Speaker 3: (16:42)
Thank you very much and we invite you for an interview whenever you’re-
Donald Trump: (16:44)
Oh, good.
Speaker 3: (16:45)
Available. Can I ask you just to be clear and for future presidents, is abuse of power an impeachable offense?
Donald Trump: (16:54)
Well, you got to talk to the lawyers about it. But I will tell you, there’s nothing here. I had a very innocent conversation with a very fine gentleman from the Ukraine and it was based on that. People don’t even want to talk about the conversation. I got to watch glimpses in between all of these meetings that I just told you about. I got to watch glimpses of what is taking place, wasting time in Washington. And I watched … They don’t talk about my conversation. They don’t talk about my transcripts.
Donald Trump: (17:21)
Remember this, when Schiff made up the phony story and he repeated it to Congress and the world and it was a totally phony story. Then I released the transcript. There was supposed to be a second whistleblower. What happened to him? There was … Wait, wait. Otherwise, I won’t do your show. Wait. There was supposed to be an informer. What happened to the informer? All of these people disappeared and when they saw this transcript they said, “We got problems.” But they went ahead because they were already there, because they had a phony concocted story made up. So here’s the story. Did nothing wrong. It was a perfect conversation. It was totally appropriate.
Donald Trump: (18:03)
The best lawyers in the world have looked at it. The Department of Justice has looked at it, given it a sign off. There was nothing wrong. They never thought I was going to release the conversation. They probably didn’t think we had transcribers or we had it transcribed or taped, but they never thought we were going to release it. When we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the Democrats. Because they say, “Wait a minute, this is much different than Shifty-Schiff told us.” So we’re doing very well. I got to watch enough. I thought our team did a very good job. But honestly, we have all the material. They don’t have the material.
Speaker 3: (18:43)
I ask you, because your attorneys say it’s not. Alan Dershowitz says the framers of the constitution did not permit impeachment on grounds like abuse of power or obstruction. They objected open-ended [inaudible 00:18:53] criteria. So for future presidents, is abuse of power an impeachable offense?
Donald Trump: (18:57)
Well, it depends. But if you take a look at this, and from what everybody tells me, all I do is I’m honest. I make great deals. I’ve made great deals for our country. Now we’re working with the WTO. You’re probably surprised by that, but there’s been a longterm abusive situation to the US. I make great deals for our country and they’re honest deals. And when you read that transcription … And by the way, it wasn’t one call. It was two calls. Nobody likes to talk about that. There was one call, which was perfect. And then there was a second call, I guess a couple of months later, which was perfect.
Donald Trump: (19:33)
The President of Ukraine said it was perfect. The Foreign Minister of Ukraine said it was perfect. So if we have a transcription, we have the call and we have the person on the other side of the call saying it was good. Now here’s the other thing, they got their money long before a schedule. They got all their money. What nobody says, it’s very important to me, why isn’t Germany paying, why isn’t UK paying? Why isn’t France paying? Why aren’t the European nations paying? Why is it always the sucker United States? That’s one. And the other thing I wanted to check very carefully and it’s very important is corruption. And we do that too. This was a perfect call and I think we’re doing very well.
Speaker 4: (20:18)
[crosstalk 00:20:20]. [inaudible 00:20:18] from the [inaudible 00:20:24] Times, and I thank you, Mr. President. [inaudible 00:20:26] phase two China trade deal, do you expect human rights in Hong Kong to be part of the discussion?
Donald Trump: (20:31)
We are discussing it already, yes. We would like to see if we can do something. But again, we’re doing a trade deal and it’s a very big deal. Phase one is done. Phase two is being discussed. We are discussing aspects of your question, yes.
Speaker 5: (20:46)
[crosstalk 00:20:46]. Mr. President, thank you.
Donald Trump: (20:46)
No, [crosstalk 00:20:48].
Speaker 5: (20:51)
Mr. President, thank you. Just to clarify a policy question, we know that the Senate will set the rules for witnesses, but what did you want? At one point, you demanded witnessing-
Donald Trump: (21:01)
I can live either way.
Speaker 5: (21:02)
But what do you want?
Donald Trump: (21:03)
I can live … I’ll tell you what I think, it’s such a hoax. I think it’s so bad for our country when we have the head of the World Trade Organization here and he has to listen to this nonsense about a call that was perfect that nobody talks about. I never see them talking about the transcription. I never see them talking about the call because there’s nothing to say. You read it. Somebody should just sit there and read it and everybody’s going to say, “You mean that’s an impeachable event?” If that were impeachable, Lyndon Johnson would have had to leave office on his first day. Kennedy would’ve had to leave office his first day. It’s a hoax and you understand it’s a hoax better than anybody. It’s a hoax and that’s the way it is. Yeah. Go ahead.
Speaker 5: (21:44)
[crosstalk 00:07:44]. Mr. President, a question on Iran. Initially, you said repeatedly to Americans that after Iran retaliated for the Soleimani strike, no Americans were injured. We now know at least 11 US service men were airlifted from Iraq. Can you explain the discrepancy?
Donald Trump: (22:01)
No. I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things, but I would say, and I can report it is not very serious, not very serious.
Speaker 5: (22:11)
So you don’t think that their potential traumatic brain injury is serious?
Donald Trump: (22:14)
They told me about it numerous days later. You’d have to ask Department of Defense. No, I don’t consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries that I’ve seen. I’ve seen what Iran has done with their roadside bombs to our trips. I’ve seen people with no legs and with no arms. I’ve seen people that were horribly, horribly injured in that area, that war. In fact, many cases put those bombs, put there by Soleimani who’s no longer with us. I consider them to be really bad injuries. No, I do not consider that to be bad injuries, no.
Speaker 6: (22:49)
[crosstalk 00:22:49] trade deal. Do you have any timeline for that and if you don’t hit that timeline-
Donald Trump: (22:55)
Yeah.
Speaker 6: (22:55)
If there is one, are you automatically going to go to [crosstalk 00:00:22:57]-
Donald Trump: (22:56)
I have a timeline … Yeah.
Speaker 6: (22:59)
Or is there another avenue other than [crosstalk 00:22:59]-
Donald Trump: (23:01)
Yeah, great question, actually. I don’t have a timeline, but maybe I do in my own mind. They have to move relatively quickly, but they have to treat us fairly. The European Union was formed pretty much for this reason, I suspect, if you really think about it. Why was it formed? They formed their airplane company, which does very nicely and now is doing better than ever because Boeing has not had a good time of it. They better start recovering fast. I hope they do. They have some good people in there now. They have great people in the company, but they have some good people leading it now. So hopefully, that’ll be taken care of. But, no. I have a date in my mind and it’s a fairly quick date and if we’re unable to make a deal, then we’ll do even better. We’ll do even better.
Donald Trump: (23:49)
[crosstalk 00:23:49] But they haven’t treated us right. Look, the United States has been losing 150 billion and more for many years. 150 billion, more. I mean, really, more than that with the European Union. They have trade barriers where you can’t trade. They have tariffs all over the place. They make it impossible. They are frankly more difficult to do business with then China. We have a great relationship with China now. We had some testy moments, very testing, beyond testy. Worse than a lot of people would understand, but we got it done and I think phase two will go nicely also. But with the European Union, and frankly I’ll be honest, I wanted to wait until I finished China before I went to work on respectfully Europe. But Europe is so beautiful. I guess a lot of us come indirectly from Europe. Isn’t that nice? But they are actually more difficult to do business with than China.
Donald Trump: (24:48)
All you have to do is ask Boris, but I think Boris is going to be okay too. I think he’s going to come out great. I think he had a lot of guts. He’s done a terrific job. I think he’s in a good position, which they would’ve never been able to do before Boris. I have a date. I have a very specific date in my mind.
Speaker 6: (25:05)
Before or after the election? Your election [crosstalk 00:25:06]-
Donald Trump: (25:09)
Before. I think we’ll have a deal before.
Speaker 6: (25:11)
What do you-
Donald Trump: (25:12)
Yeah, I think so. They have to do that. I mean, I don’t want to … Look, I’m not saying it from strength or from weakness. I’m just saying they have to do it. They wanted to make a deal. Our nation, our country wanted to make a deal under President Obama. The EU refused to talk to them and then they said, “No, no, we like it the way it is.” Of course, they like it the way it is. They’re making 150 billion-plus. Right? And as you know, President Bush was desperate to make a deal. They wouldn’t even talk to him. Me, they’re talking to and we’ll have a deal. If we don’t have a deal, we’ll do even better. [crosstalk 00:25:47] Yes, [inaudible 00:25:49].
Speaker 7: (25:47)
Is it true that you’re considering extending the travel ban and if so-
Donald Trump: (25:52)
Yes.
Speaker 7: (25:52)
Which countries?
Donald Trump: (25:54)
We have a travel ban. It’s a very powerful ban and a lot of … I heard a reporter recently say he lost the ban in court. They didn’t say that we won it in the Supreme Court. I’d say that’s a little deceptive, John, wouldn’t you? He said he lost the travel ban. I didn’t lose the travel ban. The travel ban was lost in the lower courts and won in the Supreme Court two years ago. No, we are. We’re adding a couple of countries to it. We have to be safe. Our country has to be safe. You see what’s going on in the world. Our country has to be safe, so we have a very strong travel ban and we’ll be adding a few countries to it.
Speaker 7: (26:31)
Could you give us a hint about the region or the country?
Donald Trump: (26:34)
It’s going to be announced very shortly, okay? [crosstalk 00:26:36] John? [crosstalk 00:26:37]. Yeah, John.
John: (26:39)
Thank you, Mr. President. In regards to the proceedings going on in the Senate, would you like to see this over quickly? Would you like to see a thorough examination of the facts? What did you make of the dustup between the White House council, Pat Cipollone and Jerry Nadler last night? And are you absolutely against John Bolton testifying?
Donald Trump: (26:58)
Well, you’re asking a lot of questions.
John: (27:01)
Three of them. That’s not a lot.
Donald Trump: (27:01)
First of all, Jerry Nadler, I’ve known him a long time. He’s a sleazebag. Everybody knows that. Pat Cipollone is a high quality human being. I was very impressed with Pat. He had great emotion yesterday. Pat’s a brilliant guy, but I’ve never seen that emotion and that’s real emotion. That’s because he knows this is a hoax. And I was very proud of the job he did. I’ve known Jerry Nadler for a long time. He’s opposed many of my jobs. I got them all built, very successfully built in New York. So we have yet another fight. Isn’t it amazing? Isn’t it surprising? Isn’t it amazing? But if you look at other aspects or other parts of your question, I think that the … I would rather go the long way. I would rather interview Bolton. I would rather interview a lot of people. The problem with John is that it’s a national security problem. You can’t-
Donald Trump: (28:03)
… and is that it’s a national security problem. You can’t have somebody who’s at national security and if you think about it, John, he knows some of my thoughts. He knows what I think about leaders. What happens if he reveals what I think about a certain leader and it’s not very positive and then I have to deal on behalf of the country? It’s going to be very hard. It’s going to make the job very hard. He knows other things. And I don’t know if we left on the best of terms. I would say probably not. And so you don’t like people testifying when they didn’t leave on good terms, and that was due to me, not due to him. And so we’ll see what happens. But when you have a national security, you could call it presidential prerogative, you could just call it the way I look at it, I call it national security for national security reasons. Executive privilege, they say.
Donald Trump: (28:54)
So, John would certainly fit into that. When you’re a national security advisor, like this gentleman is doing a fantastic job, Robert. I just think it’s very hard and I’ve always gotten along. I’ve actually gotten along with John Bolton. He didn’t get along with other people, a lot of other people. But when he knows my thoughts on certain people and other governments, and we’re talking about massive trade deals and war and peace and all these different things that we talk about, that’s really a very important national security problem. I think having somebody, other people … Mick Mulvaney is probably around here someplace. I’d love to have Mick go, but I think that he’s really expressed himself very well when he did a Chris Wallace interview. That was a very, very powerful interview. That was a long, tough … Chris is a tough interviewer, a very talented guy. I think it’s not much he can add. He’s been great.
Donald Trump: (29:52)
I’ll tell you what I don’t like though. I’d love to have Mike Pompeo testify, but again, that’s a national security problem. But I’d love to have Mike Pompeo, but it’s a national security problem. I’d love to have Rick Perry. Rick Perry has asked me, “I’d love to testify. Please let me testify,” because he knows this is all a hoax. He understands it better than most. And Rick Perry would love to testify, but we’re dealing with national security. We’re dealing with one other thing. Our country has been tied up with this hoax from the day I came down the escalator. We’ve been fighting it. I’ve been fighting it from the day I’ve been elected. I would say probably long before. It could be long before I came down the escalator that some people have said that, which is hard to believe … Wait John. It’s hard to believe we’ve been fighting this.
Donald Trump: (30:43)
Personally, I’d rather go the long route. It’s horrible for our country. Our country has to get back to business. We have people that are corrupt, like Adam Schiff, who misquotes … I don’t mean misquotes. Makes up a statement. He had no idea that I was going to release the transcript. He never thought I’d do that. And for that I thank the president of Ukraine because we got their approval. He had no idea I was going to do that. But these are corrupt people, some of them. And some of them are just playing the political game. But if you look at the poll numbers, my poll numbers are the highest they’ve ever been. If you look at the funding numbers, if you look at what the money raised by the Republican party has just set a record. Nobody’s ever done this before. It’s because of the impeachment hoax.
Reporter: (31:34)
No, no. Sorry. Sorry. I’ve got three quick ones too, Mr. President, if you don’t mind.
Donald Trump: (31:36)
Three?
Reporter: (31:37)
Three, yes. Well, my husband has three, I have three.
Donald Trump: (31:39)
That means six. Six for the family.
Reporter: (31:41)
Thank you very much. Thanks for appreciating the family.
Donald Trump: (31:43)
Go ahead. No, go ahead.
Reporter: (31:43)
Do you plan to show up in any way, shape or form at your trial? Number two, you called Kenneth Starr a disaster in the past, do you still feel that way about him now? And three, Lev Parnas has come forward and said that you knew everything that he was doing and you-
Donald Trump: (31:59)
He’s a con man. Ready, let me answer that one.
Reporter: (32:01)
You say that’s not true?
Donald Trump: (32:01)
I don’t know him.
Reporter: (32:02)
Okay, you don’t know him.
Donald Trump: (32:03)
Other than he’s like a groupie. He shows up at fundraisers. So I don’t know anything about him. I watched Rudy. Rudy is a terrific person, great crime fighter, the best mayor in the history of New York City by far. Solved the crime problem in New York. And I think it’s very unfair the way the media has treated Rudy Giuliani. I will say this. Parnas I don’t know other than he probably contributed to the campaign along with tens of thousands of other people. And I mean I was this weekend, I was taking pictures with hundreds of people. They contribute to the Republican party and I stand there and I take pictures and every once in a while I’ll look at somebody, I say, “Gee, I wonder when that picture is going to be in the New York Times or the Washington Post or on Fox.” So it’s one of those things. I think Rudy is a high quality person.
Reporter: (32:53)
So why is he not on your legal team? Why is he not-
Donald Trump: (32:54)
I don’t want there to be a conflict. I’d love to have Rudy on my team, but he could be a witness at some point if this whole sham continues. I would love to have Rudy on the team. Rudy is on my team, just so you understand, but I’d love to have him up there. But it could be that he’d have a conflict. It could be. But Rudy Giuliani is somebody that, I think the press has been very unfair to. Greatest mayor in the history of New York. Think of it. And one of the greatest crime fighters of the last hundred years. And he hates to see what’s happening because he knows corruption really better than anybody. Okay. Go ahead.
Reporter: (33:31)
And Kenneth Starr, how do you feel about him now?
Donald Trump: (33:32)
So, Ken Starr is a terrific man. I did make that statement because frankly I didn’t think that Bill Clinton should have been impeached. And I thought it was terrible. I didn’t know Ken Starr, but I didn’t think that Bill Clinton should have been impeached. And I was pretty vocal about that. I didn’t know Ken, but what I did know is he was very smart. He was very tough. He was very talented. But in a certain way I was sticking up for Bill Clinton. I sort of still feel that way. I mean, what he did was nothing good. There was a lot of lying going on. There were a lot of things, a lot of bad things. Now with me, there’s no lying. There’s no nothing. They have nothing. They don’t even have a crime. They say this is the only one that’s ever been impeached and he didn’t commit a crime. I didn’t commit a crime. And then you get into high crimes and misdemeanors, but I didn’t commit a crime. So no, I have great respect for Ken, but I didn’t think, frankly that Bill Clinton should’ve been impeached.
Reporter: (34:31)
So, what do you think? Will you show up at your trial any day in any way, shape, or form?
Donald Trump: (34:33)
I’d love to go. Wouldn’t that be great? Wouldn’t that be beautiful?
Reporter: (34:34)
So, why don’t you go?
Donald Trump: (34:36)
I don’t know. I’d sort of love sit right in the front row and stare in their corrupt faces. I’d love to do it.
Reporter: (34:42)
So why not just do it?
Donald Trump: (34:43)
I don’t know. Don’t keep talking because you may convince me to do it.
Reporter: (34:47)
Do you think [inaudible 00:34:47] and Sekulow would want you there?
Donald Trump: (34:49)
I think they might have a problem. I think they might. And by the way, I think they’ve done a really good job. And I think the other side has so lied. I watch the lies from Adam Schiff. He’ll stand, he’ll look at a microphone and he’ll talk like he’s so aggrieved. These two guys, these are major sleazebags. They’re very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest people. When somebody will make up a statement that I made, when you remember the statement, eight times quid pro quo, eight times, think of it. How can you say eight times? That would mean I was asking somebody eight different times for the same thing. What kind of a conversation would that be? If you asked once, that’d be fine. If you asked twice, that’d be … How can you ask eight times? They would say you’re a loony tune. Right? And then he said, I think he finished by saying, “Don’t call me. I’ll call you,” that I said that. He made that statement. “Don’t call me, I’ll call you.” And he didn’t say he made it up.
Donald Trump: (35:50)
Now ultimately he had to, in a sense, apologize. He can hardly apologize, but he had to apologize because fortunately we had a tape. We had the transcripts. I am so happy that I had the transcripts because it showed he’s a liar and he’s a fraud and they continue to just go on and on. But this has happened to me with the Russian hoax. This has happened to me, I called it the witch hunt, greatest witch hunt in American history, and the Mueller report, which exonerated totally. There was no collusion after all that. Two years, there was no collusion. And then what happened to Jill Stein from the Green Party gets called a Russian agent by crooked Hillary and then Tulsi Gabbard. I don’t know either of them, but I know they’re not Russian agents. Gets called a Russian agent. This is what these people do. They demean, and the press plays in because the press largely is their partner.
Donald Trump: (36:52)
And one thing, if we could straighten out the press in our country, we would have a place that would be so incredible. The press is so dishonest, so corrupt. I read it all the time. Stories. I don’t mind bad stories. I deserve bad stories sometimes, but when I do something great or good, let it be written about good. Same thing with other people. The corruption in the media, as I call it the fake news media, is unbelievable. And hopefully everybody’s going to learn a lesson. People got Pulitzer Prizes for their coverage of me, and it turned out they were totally wrong. Other people, Sean Hannity, Rushbo, a lot of great people, a lot of great writers, they got it right. They didn’t get Pulitzer Prizes, but they got it right. The Russian hoax was a terrible thing. The dossier was a phony deal paid for by Hillary Clinton and the DNC and used in the Pfizer coup. It’s totally illegally. No, it’s a terrible thing that happened. This was a take down attempt at a sitting president of the United States, and we caught them. So let’s see what happens.
Reporter 2: (38:15)
Mr. President, would you consider delaying the State of the Union if the impeachment trial has not-
Donald Trump: (38:22)
No, I don’t see. A very excellent writer, Bob Woodward, I guess he’s doing another book on Trump, but this time I’ll actually give him an interview. He said, “You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?” I said, “No, I’m not enjoying it.” He said, “No, you act like you’re winning and you won. You’re actually enjoying it.” I said, “I’m not enjoying it. I’m doing it because it’s very important what I’m doing.” I consider what I’ve done here with this whole witch hunt from day one with the insurance policy, with the horrible statements made between Strzok and Page and McCabe and Comey, who lied to Congress and did so many other bad things. He lied and he leaked. When I finish, I think that this is going to go down as one of the greatest things I’ve done for our country. These are bad, corrupt people. These are bad people, and very bad for our country. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.

Donald Trump: (13:19)
Well thank you very much. And I’m thrilled to be back in Wisconsin where we had a very big night a few years ago. You remember that very big night? Remember that? They said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.” And since then we’ve produced everything we said and more and more.
Donald Trump: (13:48)
Before it was talk. I said, “I’m going to do this. We’re going to take care of your trade.” What we’ve done with China now, on Wednesday we signed, that’s tomorrow. What we’ve done with the US MCA, what we’ve done with Japan, $40 billion trade deal that a lot of it has to do with the farmers. South Korea. Oh, you got to love Trump, you got to love Trump.

And then our opponents say, “We’re not going to win. Let’s impeach President Trump. Let’s impeach him.” We’ve got the greatest economy in our history. Our military has been totally rebuilt. “Let’s impeach him.” But we’ve created 7 million jobs since the election, including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs. Nobody thought that was possible.
Donald Trump: (15:37)
And we will soon be replacing the NAFTA catastrophe, one of the worst trade deals in the history of the world, frankly with the incredible US MCA, Canada, Mexico, a giant victory for Wisconsin workers, farmers and dairy producers, a tremendous victory. And we may get that all taken care of this week or next week. It just needs one more vote and we’ll get that out of the Republican Senate. The Republican Senate will be great. Tomorrow we’ll also be signing our phase one trade deal with China, massively boosting exports of products made and produced right here in the great state of Wisconsin. So after years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the United States Military to a point that it has never been before and it’s now more advanced, more lethal, and more powerful than ever. And last year, our great American warriors, because that’s what they are. And they love it. I got to tell you, they love it, right? They love doing that. They wouldn’t trade places with me under any circumstances. They wouldn’t trade places with all of our great Wisconsin politicians. They want to be a military warrior and we don’t want them for that. We want them doing what they’re doing. But our great warriors carried out a daring nighttime raid and terminated the founder and leader of ISIS. The animal known as al-Baghdadi is dead and the wicked caliphate is 100% destroyed.
Donald Trump: (17:46)
And I will tell you when we took over a little less than three years ago, ISIS was all over the place. Now the caliphate is 100% destroyed. Do you remember when I wanted to leave when it was at 98%? I said, let some of the other countries finish it off. We’re going home, right? They all said, “Oh, no sir, please finish it.” So we finished it off to 100%.
Donald Trump: (18:18)
A few days ago. We took bold and decisive action to defend American lives and deliver American justice. At my direction, the United States military launched a flawless precision strike that killed the world’s number one terrorist, number one terrorist. Do you know who that is? Qasem Soleimani, number one terrorist in the world.
Donald Trump: (18:51)
Soleimani was responsible for murdering and wounding thousands of Americans and was actively planning new attacks, but we stopped them cold. And frankly, they already started the attack, as you saw in Baghdad, on our very large embassy in Baghdad. That was already started. And I said to our generals, “Get there now. We don’t want to have another Benghazi. Not on my watch, or on any watch.”
Donald Trump: (19:22)
They said, “Sir, we’ll be there tomorrow.” I said, “Nope, you got to be there right now. Get them over there now.” There are thousands of soldiers. They were soldiers. You take a look at that crowd. That was not protesters. They were soldiers, and they were surrounding our embassy in Baghdad. And all of a sudden they see these beautiful, very expensive, I will tell you, brand new Apache helicopters roaming over the top. And then they see our great military. You saw them in the plane, right? Some of them were getting out of their pajamas. They were. I said, “Don’t worry about it.” I said, “We won’t put that on.” But they were sitting there and they were calling a roll call in the plane. Right? And it was a beautiful sight. And these guys were better than Tom Cruise at his best.
Crowd: (20:22)
Booo!
Donald Trump: (21:18)
All right. So tomorrow with the fake news, here’s your headline. We have thousands of people outside wanting to get into and they can’t, because you people got here first. But so here’s your headline tomorrow: Protestors Disturb the Rally. One protester, a very weak voice. If you people wouldn’t go crazy every time you see something, he’d go right through and nobody would even know she was there. Now she’s going home to mom where she will be in big trouble.
Donald Trump: (22:00)
Because I guarantee you that mom voted for Trump. And in 10 years from now, when I run yet again, she’ll be voting for Trump too. I’m only kidding. I’m only kidding. We drive them crazy. We drive them crazy. They say, “You know he’s not leaving, don’t you? He’s never leaving.” They say, “He’s going to win. He’s never going to leave.” These people, it’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome. It really is. You know what they don’t know is that if for any reason, after five years we do leave, which we will, because I believe in that stuff. Right? But you know what’s going to happen to their industry. They’re all going to die and fold up. Going to be very boring out there, very boring. That’s why I say at some point, every single one of them will be endorsing Donald Trump.
Donald Trump: (23:18)
But crazy Bernie Sanders and the Washington Democrats, by the way, Bernie is surging. Bernie is surging. Bernie. But the Democrats are outraged that we kill this terrorist monster even though this monster was behind hundreds and hundreds of death.
Crowd: (23:42)
Boo! Boo!
Crowd: (23:42)
USA! USA! USA!
Donald Trump: (24:23)
That’s two. Hey, speaking of protesters, have you seen what’s happened in Iran? The protesters are on our side. First time ever. They’re on our side. In fact, they put this big American flag on the street. And the Iranians, thousands and thousands of Iranians were supposed to walk on it and trample it and step and beat the hell out of it. Every one of them went around that flag. They like Trump. They like you. I’m just your representative, but they like us. They like us. They haven’t seen anything like that in a long time. They went around, did you see it? They went around the flag. They didn’t want to touch it. They love America. They love our country. That’s called progress. That’s called progress.
Donald Trump: (25:26)
But the Democrats are doing everything possible to disparage what we did with the hit on this monster. Many of the young men and women you see walking around without arms, without legs and without … were done by Soleimani. That’s what he loved. He loved the roadside bomb. That’s what he loved. Thousands and thousands and thousands in Iraq, in Afghanistan, roadside bombs. He was the king of the roadside bombs. Great percentages of people don’t have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch.
Donald Trump: (26:06)
Now the Democrats should be outraged by Soleimani’s evil crimes, not that decision to end his wretched life. They’re saying, “Well, he was a general. He was this. He was that.” You know what? Number one, he wasn’t supposed to be there. He was a designated terrorist by president Obama who didn’t do anything about it as usual. As usual, they don’t do anything. They designate and they don’t do anything about. He should’ve been killed 20 years ago.
Donald Trump: (26:53)
Now, here’s the story with the Democrats. If I didn’t kill him, and let’s say we lost three, four, five embassies or bases or thousands of people or hundreds of people or two people were killed, they would have said, “Trump should have taken him out.” Anything we do, they go the opposite. So we kill him. And that was precision. Some people thought it went much too fast. Went too fast. So we kill him and they say, “What a horrible …” If we didn’t kill him, they’d say, “What a horrible thing.” Right?
Donald Trump: (27:28)
You know with the wall, we’re building the wall. You know that right? [inaudible 00:27:36] And by the way, they think they caught me. They never catch us. Because Mexico’s paying for the wall. You know that. You’ll see that. It’s all worked out. Mexico’s paying. It’s driving them crazy. Now they say, “Okay, he’s building the wall. But Mexico didn’t pay.” Mexico will pay. And here’s the thing. You’ll see that it’ll come out. We’ll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before. Our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch, because nobody’s watching.
Donald Trump: (28:14)
haven’t been doing great on the debates. I have to tell you. But we are building this wall. We’re over 100 miles right now. We’re going to be expanding the length. You have a lot of natural where you have 1,978 miles. You need 500 miles, but 700 would be good, 750 or so would be great. We’re going to now get it up. We have all the financing. You think it’s easy getting financing when people put … I can get anything from them. I can get whatever I want in terms of money except for a wall. And I made one big mistake. I should have said to them, “We will not build the wall. We don’t want the wall.” They would have insisted that we build it. We would have had all the money we wanted. I made a mistake. I made a big mistake. Now we’re building the wall. It’s going up and it’s going up rapidly and very soon we’ll be building about a mile a day. And we should be up to over 400 miles by next year, the end of next year, and shortly thereafter it’ll be finished. And it’s already having a tremendous impact on people not being able to come into our country.
Donald Trump: (29:31)
Bernie and the radical left cannot protect your family and they cannot protect our country, nor do they want to, I think. According to Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, who has somewhat less Indian blood in her than I do, and I have none. Remember? Oh, we hit her hard. But I hit her too early, but now it doesn’t matter. She’s not going anywhere. But Bernie said, according to her, Bernie said, and I don’t believe that he said this, because I don’t know him. I don’t particularly like him. He’s a nasty guy. But I don’t believe he said it. It’s not his field. You have to know what people say. She said, right, that Bernie stated strongly that a woman can’t win for president. A woman can win for president. Fortunately that could happen. Who knows?
Donald Trump: (30:39)
But she said that Bernie said, “A woman can’t win.” I don’t believe that Bernie said that. I really don’t know. Just it’s not the kind of a thing he’d say. If you want to keep America safe, just vote Republican. We’re doing so well. We’re doing so well. Now this was … leave him alone. That’s all right. Let security just take care of her.
Crowd: (31:07)
Don’t worry about that.
Donald Trump: (31:12)
Okay, you all right? Get him out here. Good. Good job security. Good job. Do we love law enforcement?
Donald Trump: (31:51)
And is there ever, ever a better place to be than a Trump rally on some night during some week? The truth, is we have a great time. But you know what? More importantly we get things done. We’re getting everything done. But even president Obama’s own former National Security Advisor, a highly respected general named Jim Jones, praised our action to take out Soleimani and said it was absolutely correct and it was the absolute right thing to do. I’m sure they like him very much. He sounds like our kind of a guy. So Jim, if they’ve given you a hard time, come on over to the Republican party. No, he’s a respected guy. He said we did the right thing.
Donald Trump: (32:46)
Everyone knows. They’re saying, “Was the attack eminent? Was it eminent?” Does the fact that he’s killed hundreds of thousands of people and thousands of Americans and horribly killed and wounded thousands and thousands? That doesn’t matter. Was the attack eminent? I think they’re going to start a new investigation. Was the attack or this horror … and by the way, he was in a country he wasn’t allowed to be in. We don’t mention that because he was designated and he wasn’t allowed to be there. And he was there with the head of Hezbollah, and they were talking about, like Hillary Clinton. They were talking about weddings and working out. Soleimani and the head of Hezbollah, they were talking about weddings, working out.
Donald Trump: (33:36)
Or Bill Clinton in the back of the airplane with the Attorney General, where they may have made her an offer that you’re going to go to the Supreme Court. Or they may have said, “You’re going to to stay Attorney General, but help. Help.” They may have said that. Do you think they would have said that? No. Nothing like that. But do you remember? They talked about golf and grandchildren, right? 45 minutes. I like golf.
Donald Trump: (34:03)
45 minutes. I like golf and I love my grandchildren. I don’t think I can talk to somebody about them for 45 minutes that I don’t even know. 45. I have a beautiful grandchild. He’s really beautiful. He’s so great. Okay. What else am I going to say, right? Then I took a… Let’s talk one or two. How’s Tiger doing? How’s this one? How’s that one? That’s another five minutes, right? What am I going to do with the other 35 minutes? Maybe I’m going to talk about Supreme court appointments, et cetera.
Donald Trump: (34:35)
Well, we’re doing very well. But at this very moment, the good people of Iran are taking to the streets in numbers like nobody’s seen before, and they’re really protesting the repressive regime and demanding a better future. They’re great people. The great people of Iran, the great people, they get it. And they’re tired of watching their leaders plunder around to stoke violence and death and war. And you know, Iran’s caused us problems for 40 years. Just so you understand, Reagan had it. Iran Contra. Carter had it. 52 hostages. How about that? Destroyed his presidency. It was pretty well destroyed before that in all fairness. But it didn’t help. Actually probably got Reagan elected, if you think about it, right? But no, carter had it, 52 hostages. Reagan had Iran Contra. Obama had just… He was begging them for everything, but Obama gave them $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash [inaudible 00:01:46].
Donald Trump: (35:48)
Got zero. He got zero out of it. He got zero. I’d love to have that money back. It’s a lot of money. But I’ve warned the Ayatollah and the government of Iran that they must not harm, hurt, or kill any protesters. The whole world is watching. It’s watching.
Donald Trump: (36:16)
They’ve killed thousands of protests. We support the Iranian people and their courageous struggle for freedom. It’s incredible what’s going on over there. It really is. But we’re watching it. We’re watching very closely. And we were ready. That night when the attack was made on us, attack was made on us. Remember this, they killed an American, they killed other people just before that. And so we did what we did, right? And they said, it’s our turn now. I said, you better be careful when you say it’s our turn. Because we had designated targets that you wouldn’t know… It would have taken him 30 years to rebuild if that was even possible. It’s true, it’s true. And we saw those missiles launched, and they were big and they were fast, and they were accurate. Four of them went bad. They fell way short. But 12 of them hit. And I said, man, they are quick. They knew immediately what they were, and they saw those missiles hit. I said, how bad is it? It hit a base. And an hour later or so, we get a call back. I said, how many killed? Nobody, sir.
Donald Trump: (37:43)
I said, how many hurt? They said, nobody, sir. And I said, they just saved themselves a trillion dollars and a lot of lives. That’s true. A trillion, not a billion. A trillion. So they did a very smart thing and we’re not looking for regime change. They’ve tried that with Libya. They go, Hillary Clinton, let’s get rid of Libya. Let’s get rid of Gaddafi. Let’s get rid of Gaddafi. How’s that working out? Right? Let’s get rid of Gaddafi. That was a Hillary deal. Then you had Benghazi. And see Benghazi, they didn’t respond. They didn’t respond. Should be. Should be.
Donald Trump: (38:46)
And then we [inaudible 00:38:59] to Iraq. Iraq didn’t knock down the World Trade Center just in case anybody had any question. And this guy did kill. He was not a sweetheart. He was a bad guy in every way. But he did kill terrorists, right? And it became Harvard University for terrorists, right? But they did go after him, but he didn’t knock down.
Donald Trump: (39:29)
We’re getting the hell out. We’re moving… We did something in Syria. We were guarding their border. At one point, we had thousands of people. The Syrian border between Turkey and Syria, it’s been there for a thousand years. They’ve been fighting for [inaudible 00:39:45].
Donald Trump: (39:45)
Our soldiers out of there. I did. [inaudible 00:39:49] out. You know what I did with the soldiers? They don’t tell you the truth, sorry, because there are a bunch of corrupt people back there. I told Turkey, you got to defend your own border. We’re not going to defend your border. And we get along with Turkey. We get along, but they’ve been there for… And by the way, I call it a safe zone. That is the most dangerous safe zone in the world. Okay? I’m looking at the audience, there’s about three of you that want to be in that zone, okay? And you’re very tough people. But this is the most dangerous… I call it, I call it the safe zone. Some day it may be a safe zone, but I took our soldiers out, because we had an army here and we had a vast number of people here, and they were going to fight. I said, if they’re going to fight like they have been for hundreds and hundreds of years, for centuries, let them fight. But we’re getting the hell out of there, okay? But the fake news doesn’t tell you the right story. But the fake news doesn’t tell you the right story.
Donald Trump: (41:01)
Because what I did is I took our soldiers, and you know what I did? I moved them to the oil area, and we now control the oil. So they said Trump stayed in Syria. Trump said, so people said to me, why you staying in Syria?
Donald Trump: (41:22)
Okay? A long time ago. You have no idea the things and the decisions I’ve seen. So they say Trump’s in Syria, I didn’t pull out. I did pull out. We have the oil really secure. We’ll see what happens with it, but we can help our friends, the Kurds, because that’s where they got their wealth. And then ultimately it was with ISIS. But right now it’s with the United States military.
Donald Trump: (41:48)
And we also got rid of remnants of ISIS. While we’re creating jobs and killing terrorists, democrats in Congress are wasting America’s time with demented hoaxes and crazy witch hunts that had been going on by the way, from the day I came down the escalator with our future first lady.
Donald Trump: (42:22)
Somebody said to me recently, President, President, it was a friend of mine, used to always call me Donald. Hey Donald, how are you doing? Let’s go have dinner. Okay, okay, good. Now he calls me President. I told you this before. Calls me pres… They always call me President. President, President, tell me what’s happening, what’s going on, how’s it all going? You’re doing such a great job. I said, do me a favor. Call me Donald. I can’t. Now when they say, you know what that means, right? That means respect for the office of president.
Donald Trump: (42:53)
And you know what? We’re going to keep that way. We’re going to keep it that way. We’re going to keep it there. But that’s why this November we’re going back and we’re going to win the House. The Republicans are going to win the House.
Donald Trump: (43:18)
Because I don’t know if you know it. The impeachment hoax, it’s a total hoax. This is based… Just think of this. This is based on a perfect phone call. Did anybody read the transcript? It’s a perfect call. In fact, if you go back and look at Lyndon Johnson, all of them. Lyndon Johnson was sort of a tough guy. Can you imagine his phone calls? He’s probably looking down or looking up, and he’s probably saying, these people have gone crazy. That’s the nicest call I’ve ever tracked. Somebody said, I never knew you could be so nice on a telephone call. But this is all based on a simple phone call that was totally appropriate where the president of Ukraine said there was no pressure on us. Didn’t even know what they were talking about. The foreign minister said they want to impeach. Impeach the president of the United States over a perfect phone call. It’s the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country. Ever.
Donald Trump: (44:27)
But we’re going to go back and because of it, it was [inaudible 00:44:31] I don’t know if you’ve seen. Independent voters and voters I think of all of the voters, including Democrats moving over, we just got a 195 to nothing, the Republicans in the house, which was a fix. Nancy Pelosi says it must be nonpartisan. And she said, it has to be clear cut. Well, number one, never happened. No problem. Number two, look at the vote. Three Democrats voted with us. So I guess you could say it was a nonpartisan vote because they voted with us, okay? But we’re going back and we’re going to hold the Senate. And we’re going to keep the White House, but we’re going to win back the House. We’re going to win back the House. And I’m thrilled tonight. A man who has become a great friend of mine, he’s a warrior. Senator Ron Johnson is here. Come up here. What a good guy.
Donald Trump: (45:46)
Congressman Bryan Steil. Jim Sensenbrenner. Glenn Grothman. Glenn, come up. Come up. Mike Gallagher. Wisconsin house speaker Robin Voss. Wisconsin state Senate president Roger Roth. State Senate president. Come on fellas. Wisconsin state Senate majority leader Scott Fitzgerald. A friend of mine, a world champion. Would you believe it? Is Sean here? Where’s Sean? Where’s Sean? Get up here. I love champions. He would climb that sucker. He was the best in the world right here from Wisconsin, right? Congressman Sean Duffy. We miss him.
Donald Trump: (47:03)
But he signed with CNN. They paid him a lot of money, and they don’t put them on. Why? Because I’m pro-Trump. You think that’s fair, right? He’s pro-Trump. So what they’ve done is paid him money to silence him because he has a very important voice. Great job. Yeah, I like that kind of a job. I think he’s okay with it. He gets his check, they refuse to put him on. He says good things about Trump. We don’t want you on. That’s CNN. That’s how fake right there. Turn the camera on.
Donald Trump: (47:39)
And a good friend of all of ours, a Kenosha native, Reince Priebus. Reince, come up. Thank you, man. Thank you Reince. This is a great group of Republican people, but more importantly, it’s a great group of winners. They have been so great, so they worked so hard and I just want to thank you all for being here tonight. Thank you.
Ron Johnson: (48:46)
Well thank you for your strong show support for President Trump. We ran a pretty tough campaign together here in Wisconsin 2016, and when it was all said and done, I was tired. I had to take some days off. You know who didn’t take any days off? President Trump. I have never seen a man work harder, being so dedicated, so in love with America. That is why we all need to make sure that he wins a second term.
Ron Johnson: (49:29)
Four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years. I have also… I’m 64 years old. I’ve never in my lifetime seen a man get elected president of the United States where there wasn’t some measure of well wishes, some honeymoon period where America gathered around that individual and said, Mr. President, we all said, it’s a big job. We wish you well. Keep us safe. Make this country prosperous. That hasn’t happened. That’s because the Democrats simply won’t admit he beat them. He has been tormented since the day after the election, but he has held strong. It hasn’t bothered him. He’s just pressed forward. He’s made this country great. Our economy’s in great shape. He deserves to get reelected. Like all of you, like all of you, he loves his country, he will do everything to defend it. We love President Trump. God bless you, president Trump.
Donald Trump: (51:19)
Thank you Ron. A great guy. Thanks to strong Republican leadership like Ron, like all of them that you just saw, America is winning again. America is respected again. And America is thriving again like never before. We’re doing great. We’re the envy of the world. And under my administration, we now have the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in the history of our country.
Donald Trump: (51:57)
And in your great state, Wisconsin… You ever noticed with Biden, he’s always calling the wrong state? And in your great state of Iowa, Iowa. It’s Iowa, right? No, it’s Wisconsin. Oh, I meant Wisconsin. Oh, I didn’t know I was in Wisconsin. That’s fine. How many times has he done that, by the way? Lots of times, he said.
Donald Trump: (52:21)
It’s great to be in the state of Ohio. No sir, you’re in Florida. Many times. The sad part about that… Sleepy Joe is right. You know the sad part about that? When you do that, you can’t really recover. You can be Winston Churchill, make the finest remainder of remarks, but you get killed. And he does it every time. And the fake news, they give him a total pass and that’s okay. It’s all right.
Donald Trump: (52:48)
It’s going to happen to all of us someday. Does anybody get that? Yeah. In Wisconsin, the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history. How’s that for a sound bite? How do you beat that sound bite, right? So now the people of Wisconsin are going to say, well let’s see the state set a record, most successful it’s ever been. And by the way, that’s because we got a lot of help from a guy named Scott Walker. Your governor. Ron Johnson, all those guys. Because this didn’t happen so quickly.
Donald Trump: (53:42)
But think. So how do you beat that? You have the most successful, lowest unemployment rate you’ve ever had. And then they say, somebody’s going to come and say, well we’ll do a better job. Really, you’re going to do a better job? The lowest in history by far, your number one economic numbers by far. Oh, let’s put somebody else in as president. I don’t think so. Right?
Donald Trump: (54:01)
But here’s one that I loved the most. African American, Hispanic American, Asian American unemployment rates have reached the lowest levels ever recorded in the history of our country. And here’s another one. African American youth, the way it was was so high was so horrible. Youth unemployment has reached an all time low in recorded history. African-American poverty has reached the lowest rate ever recorded also.
Donald Trump: (54:52)
By the way, just out of curiosity, how are you 401k’s doing? [inaudible 00:55:02]? The only question are you at 70, 80, 90, 97%? He goes higher. What are you at? What’s yours? 100%. Not bad. I know who he’s voting for. But think of this, because this is what it’s about. Is that these companies, these big public companies, they’re owned by the people, they’re owned by everybody. Rich people, and they’re owned by everybody. We have set 141 records on the stock market, highest levels ever in recorded history. 141 records.
Donald Trump: (55:47)
That means, in less than three years, for 141 days, we set a record. Think of it, we’ve said 141 records. Who the hell can do that? And if our opponents had won the election, instead of going up, we’re very close to 30,000 on the Dow. Nobody thought that was possible. And clearly the fakers back there, nobody thought that was possible. Instead of being up, you would have… I believe, I really believe, because regulation, so important, tax cuts, so important to get it all going. I believe instead of being up massively, whatever the number is, but depending on who you are, changes, but it’s all way over 60, 70, 80, you guys know. You would have been down 50, 60, 70. You would have been down at a level, you would probably be extremely depressed, right now. You wouldn’t have bought all those brand new keep America great hats.
Donald Trump: (56:57)
Don’t worry, we’re never getting rid of MAGA, don’t worry. We don’t have the courage to get rid of MAGA. The greatest campaign in history. We’re never leaving. But you wouldn’t have bought those hats. You know why? You wouldn’t have the money to buy him. Okay? Now you can buy them, it doesn’t mean a damn thing. So let’s do it real fast. The poll, right? Make America great again, or keep America great, right? I don’t have to go through the whole deal. We’re going to do it quick. We’re going to do it quickly. Ready? Who likes make America great again?
Donald Trump: (57:33)
Whoa. They’re very loyal people in Wisconsin. Who likes keep America great?
Donald Trump: (57:47)
All right. So it surprises me every single time. But make America great again, MAGA, has never won one of these polls. You know why? We’ve rebuilt our military, we’ve cut taxes, we’ve cut regulation, our stock market hit records. It’s called keep America great. I mean, we’ve done so much. And I just got a free… See these Democrats, they go out and spend $1 million on a poll. What I do is I take my own poll. And they’ll interview 203 people. 203 people say they’ll get it wrong. Because I’m always surprised. Make America great again I think is the greatest phrase ever used in politics, right?
Donald Trump: (58:44)
So to switch it may be crazy, so we’re going to use them both. Okay? We’ll use them both. [inaudible 00:24:51]. But under the Trump economy, the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest, fastest, and largest games. You know that right? This is a blue collar boom. They don’t like telling you that. Under my administration, the growth in net worth for the bottom half of wage earners has increased 15 times more than under the three previous administrations. That’s pretty amazing.
Donald Trump: (59:22)
Because they keep saying, oh, the rich are getting richer. Well, the poor are doing the best they’ve ever done. Earnings for the bottom 10% are rising faster than earnings for the top 10% proportionately. Under eight years of the Barack Hussein Obama administration. Which administration loves spying on people’s campaigns?
Donald Trump: (59:56)
By the way, by the way, could you imagine if it were the other way around and I spied on his campaign? What would these fake news people be doing? More than 300,000 people under Obama, 300,000 people left the workforce. Under just three years of by administration, 3.5 million people have joined the workforce and nobody believed that was possible. 370 companies have signed our pledge to America’s workers providing more than 14 million Americans with new training and job opportunities. We’re training them. We’re getting them, Walmart, so many great companies, they’re training people, because they can train a much better than government. 14 million, you know who has worked so hard on that? Everybody, you’ve heard of Ivanka, right? Ivanka. She had such a passion for it. She’s very smart. I said, would you like this? You have no debt. I want to get people working. I want to get them and help families. So I said, all right, good. Look, she’s smart. Go do whatever the hell you want to do, it’s okay, darling. So she had a goal of a half a million people. She was going to get trained, get into companies. So she’d call Walmart, she’d call Exxon, she’d call all these great companies. And all of a sudden she hit 8 million. Then she hit 9 million. Don’t forget, she wanted to do 500,000, but this is her. Then she had 10 million. She just hit 14 million people have been trained by these great companies.
Donald Trump: (01:01:46)
14 million. Ivanka. 14 million, would you believe that’s possible? But that’s why we have the best unemployment rates, we have the best employment rates. By the way, very close to 160 million people are now working in the United States. Nobody’s ever even come close to that number. We’ve lifted 10 million people off federal welfare programs. Real median income is now at the highest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Think of that. Real median income.
Donald Trump: (01:02:34)
Under eight years, so we’re here three years right, but really less because when it was done, the stats, it was two and a half. But we have less than three. Under eight years of the Bush administration, household incomes grew $400. Eight years, $400. Under eight years of president Obama, household incomes grew $975,000. That’s okay, 975. Eight years, right? Under three years of the Trump administration, household incomes have risen $10,000. Ten thousand.
Donald Trump: (01:03:17)
That’s why we’re doing well. The consumer. $3,100 of which for regulatory cuts, $2,000 for the tax cuts, it’s actually higher than that, $2,500 for energy savings, and $5,000 in real wage gains. $10,000. The child tax credit alone, which every Democrat in Congress opposed, is delivering $2,200 a year to the average American family. Who’s in favor of that cut. Who’s in favor of having that? You? People don’t know. They think the Democrats gave it. The Democrats give nothing. They’re too busy. They’re too busy doing other things. They don’t do anything. They’re too busy doing other things. We ended the war on American energy. The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth.
Donald Trump: (01:04:29)
Number one in the world by far. Saudi Arabia, Russia, but we’re number one by far. And if I get a couple of additional pipelines approved, which I will very quickly, instead of waiting 20 years to get them approved, it’ll increase this by another 22% that will get them done quickly. And they’ll be environmentally friendly and all of that. I believe in that.
Donald Trump: (01:04:57)
We have eliminated a record number of job-destroying regulations. I brought back the old light bulb. Better light for much less money, if you want it, right? Little things.
Donald Trump: (01:05:15)
Somebody said, oh sir, don’t mention the light bulb. It’s hard to make an elegant speech. I’m saying I brought back the light bulb. So the new light bulb costs you five times as much, and it makes you look orange. And I was more interested in the orange than I was in the cost. But you know what, if you want, you have it. And the new bulb, I don’t know if you see it, it’s on there. It’s a hazardous waste. When that bulb ends, you’re supposed to take it to a certain dump and gingerly put it in because it’s loaded up with gasses. That’s the new… I said to somebody today in Environmental Protection, how many people do that in the country? Sir, maybe none. They throw it into the garbage can.
Donald Trump: (01:06:04)
But I’m also approving new dishwashers that give you more water so you can actually wash and rinse your dishes without having to do it ten times or five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Anybody have a new dishwasher? I’m sorry for that. I’m sorry for that. It’s worthless. They give you so little water. Do you ever see it? Air comes out? So little water. So what happens? You end up using it ten times, and the plates, then you take them out and doing the old fashioned way, right? But what do you do? You’re spending ten times for the electricity, right? So I’m putting the water back. Most places have so much water, they don’t know what the hell to do with it. A lot of people don’t realize that. So dishwashers now, you’re going to have just as much as you’ve ever had, and you’re going to use now one shot. Your dishes are going to be beautiful. I’m sorry that you just bought one of those brand new pieces of garbage, but darling, you can [inaudible 01:07:16].
Donald Trump: (01:07:21)
And it’s… Wait. And it was just announced from South Korea, makes a lot of our products, unfortunately, I put a tariff on washing machines and refrigerators, right? They just announced that they’re building major refrigerator and washing machine plants in the United States. You know why? You know why? Because they don’t want to pay the 25% tariff. So they’re building them here. That way they don’t have to pay the tariff.
Donald Trump: (01:07:59)
And just one final thing. I know this doesn’t matter, but I said leave it. It’s so inelegant to-
Donald Trump: (01:08:03)
I know this doesn’t matter, but I said leave it. It’s so inelegant to talk about it, right? Right? Isn’t it inelegant? I’m talking about dishwashers. Wait till you hear the next one. I’m talking about refrigerators. Probably wanting to say to the union, I’ll leave it out because I want to get praise for making a … You cannot make a brilliant speech where they say, “That was such an incredible, elegant speech,” if I’m talking about dishwashers, sinks, toilets, light bulbs. But sinks, toilets and showers, you don’t get any water. They put restrictors on and now they made them permanent. People used to take them out. They put restrictors on. Try going and buying a new faucet. You turn it on, no water comes out, right?
Donald Trump: (01:08:54)
We won’t talk about toilets, but you know that’s … 10, 15, but we don’t talk about that. Because I’ve said this three or four times, the only subject they ever talk about is toilets, so I don’t mention … but how about the shower? You go into a shower, and I have this beautiful head of hair, I need a lot of water. I need water. You go into the shower, right? You turn on the water, drip, drip, drip. I called the guy, “Something wrong with this?” “No, sir. It’s just the restrictor.” So you’re in there five times longer than you’re supposed to be. You use probably more water and it’s a very unpleasant experience, right? So we’re getting rid of the restrictors. You’re going to have full shower flow. Full sink.
Donald Trump: (01:09:53)
Did you ever go to the faucet? You turn on the faucet to wash your hands and it turns on so easy. It’s like this, because there’s zero pressure behind it. No water. You go like that, the thing flips on. Whoa. And then, dung, dung. These people are crazy. And then in California, this governor, who has no clue by the way, he has no clue. Governor Gavin Newsom. He sends all the water out to the Pacific and then he just comes up … I don’t know if you saw this. They come up with rules and regulations. Starting soon, if you’re a person lives in California, you only get 50 gallons of water. Now, it sounds like a lot of water, but it’s not.
Donald Trump: (01:10:40)
If you take a shower, wash your hands a couple of times a day … It’s not. Then it goes down to 47, 46, 45. Can you imagine? You pay the highest taxes outside of New York, where they’re not doing a good job in New York. They’re not doing good. Everyone’s leaving New York for other environs like Florida. It’s not good. Because the taxes are too high. Governor Cuomo’s got to get those taxes down, got to get them down, and other things have to happen. But here’s Gavin Newsom. So, Gavin Newsom, you have the water pouring down from up north, millions and millions of gallons. You know what they do with it? They divert it into the Pacific Ocean, because they have … We must be in Wisconsin. No. Millions of gallons coming down from the north.
Donald Trump: (01:11:29)
They have this massive valve. You’re talking about a valve, this is a serious valve, and they turn it and it … Because they have a tiny, tiny little fish that’s doing very poorly with or without the water. So in the meantime, if you own a home on Beverly Hills, they scream at you if you want to water your grass a little bit, right? But you have no water coming in. They divert millions and millions of gallons. And what we’ve just done for the people of California is we’ve made it possible on a federal basis that they don’t have to divert all that water anymore. Now that’s only good for California, but these are the things we do.
Donald Trump: (01:12:08)
And now the last one is we’re working on cars. We’re making them less expensive and safer. We’re giving them a tiny little bit more fuel and you’re going to save on average $3,500. You’re going to have a heavier car, a little bit, meaning you’ll have steel instead of paper mache walls. And we’re getting a lot of good response. And environmentally, it’s better, because now people … the number is 12. From 12 years ago, with the old gas guzzlers, they’ll all be trading in their cars to get the new cars, which they don’t do right now. So it’s really going to be something, and we’re in a little fight with California over that. But I think ultimately we win that one. You’ll buy a better car, a safer car, for less money. Not a bad combination. Not a bad thing.
Donald Trump: (01:12:59)
To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most, we’ve created opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring into 120 newly designated opportunity zones right here in Wisconsin. And Ron Johnson helped and Tim Scott of South Carolina helped, right? They’re doing great. They are doing good. And for decades politicians ran for office promising to defend Wisconsin workers, but then they went to Washington and lined their pockets with special interest cash as they shipped your jobs and your dreams to countries thousands of miles away. Countries that you’ve never even heard of.
Donald Trump: (01:13:46)
Globalist politicians lowered our economic defenses and allowed other nations to rob your factories, steal your farms. By the way, no estate tax on those beautiful farms. We got rid of that. So now, if you love your children and you have a farm or a small business or small ranch, or even a large ranch, you have no estate tax. You can give it to the kids. If you don’t love your children … Anybody in here does not love their children? There are some. Come on, raise your hand. There are some. You know, they’re brats. They’re little brats. They’re horrible human beings. So if you’re one of them, this doesn’t help you, because you’ll save some tax. The fact is, no estate tax on these small businesses and farms.
Donald Trump: (01:14:38)
That’s a tremendous thing, because you are dying, you are leaving the business to your kids. They all said, “Thank you very much, Daddy and Mommy,” and then they went out and mortgaged the hell out of the place and they ended up losing it to the banks. But we got rid of the estate tax on small farms and businesses and really great things. Little stuff like that we’ve done that we never said we were going to do, but these people were ransacking your communities. But we are defenseless no more, because at long last you have a president who puts America first. Been a long time. Been a long time. Been a long time.
Donald Trump: (01:15:41)
We’re putting America first. No issue of Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than that of immigration. He goes, “Traitor.” Are you having a good time, sir? I think you are. Goes, “Traitor.” I guess in a certain way they are traitors, when you think about it. Left wing politicians, I call them the Do Nothing Democrats, support deadly sanctuary cities, demonstrating their contempt, scorn and disdain for everyday Americans. These jurisdictions release dangerous, violent, criminal aliens out of their jails and directly onto your streets where they are free to rob, attack and murder American citizens. You have it right here. You have it right here.
Donald Trump: (01:16:29)
Last year, ICE … I love ICE. I think they’re so great. You know, they moved thousands of MS-13 out of our country, thousands, and others too. But ICE officers in this region of our country arrested nearly 7,000 illegal aliens with criminal records. So you have 7,000 illegal aliens having criminal records, including those charged or convicted of murder, burglary, robbery, drug crimes, killings in the most violent way. Right here in Wisconsin, cities run by far left politicians are releasing dangerous criminal aliens who abuse, assault and threaten innocent children. Your children.
Donald Trump: (01:17:23)
Last year, a place I like, the sanctuary County of Milwaukee, released an illegal alien criminal with multiple charges for sexual assault of child. Think of that, of children. He’s now at large. They’re searching all over and he’s looking for yet another victim. They’re searching all over. Allowed to go from your sanctuary city. In the city of Madison, police arrested an illegal alien for sexual assault. After authorities released him, he committed violent battery, only to be released one more time. They’re looking for him again. Isn’t that nice? The same illegal alien was then arrested for a third time in September and charged with multiple sexual assaults, including sexual assault of a child. Now that criminal is once again in Wisconsin jail and I call on your left wing officials to stop the madness and to work with ICE to ensure he is deported the hell back home. Get him out of our country.
Donald Trump: (01:18:45)
Democrats stand for crime, corruption and chaos. Republicans stand for law, order and justice. It’s true. It’s true. We believe Wisconsin should be a sanctuary for law-abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens. We are removing these illegal criminals and gang members by the tens of thousands and we will not let them back. We made a deal with Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico, where they accept them back. Under the Obama administration, they get them, they bring them back. And Honduras and Guatemala, which they get that, we’re not taking them back, but with us, they take them back. They take them back. Very great.
Donald Trump: (01:19:44)
It helped a lot when we were paying them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Think of it. I just said, we’re not paying them anymore. All of a sudden they said, “We would love to have our wonderful gang members back. We would love to have our gang members back, sir.” Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we have reduced illegal border crossings, seven straight months in a row, and we’re being helped by our new 100 miles plus of wall. Illegal crossings are down 78% since May and we have ended catch and release. That was a tough one. Our very big and very powerful border wall is going up at a record speed and we’re fully financed now. Isn’t that nice?
Donald Trump: (01:20:37)
That wasn’t easy. That was not easy. We’re adding new miles every week and we are on track to soon build that wall. You’re going to have a wall like no other. It’s going to be a powerful, terrific wall. And walls do work. I hate to say, remember the Democrats, “You don’t need walls.” Oh really? “We need drones.” They wanted us to put drones flying around, taking pictures of everybody. Now, did you see on part of the new wall two days ago, illegal aliens with drugs on their back were climbing the wall. They got to the top. You know that paddle on top is called a climb resistor. It’s very slippery and very hot, very hot, and they got stuck on the wall. They couldn’t get off the wall. Did you see that?
Donald Trump: (01:21:24)
I was watching the news. I was surprised that the fake news showed it and I said, “Isn’t that a beautiful sight?” They couldn’t get over the wall. Couldn’t get off. They had to get the fire department to get them down. Do you believe that? 30 feet up, that’s like almost a four story building. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme than they are now. They’re going crazy. They’re going totally loony. Nervous nancy, how about Nervous … How about her district? Her district is so filthy dirty. It’s filthy dirty with all of the things, I won’t say it, but the needles and everything else. These are areas that were, 10 years ago, the best in the country and now they’re disgusting.
Donald Trump: (01:22:18)
She ought to spend more time back in San Francisco taking care of her community, instead of wasting everybody’s time. But taking their cues from socialist Bernie Sanders, AOC, all these people, liberal lawmakers are pushing a government takeover of healthcare that would strip 180 million Americans of their private health insurance. Many of you have great insurance. Republicans will never let that happen. They’ll probably change their mind before the … See, this is why I don’t like talking about it now. I’d rather wait six, seven, eight months, let them say it 5, 000 times when they have to do it, and then talk.
Donald Trump: (01:23:13)
They want to take away your private health insurance. We will protect patients with preexisting conditions like nobody else, and we will protect your preexisting physicians, which you’ve had to get rid of. Which you will have to get rid of when this new plan never happens. Don’t worry about it. It’s not going to happen. It’s not going to happen. I wouldn’t worry about it. Sounds nice. It doesn’t even sound good, frankly. There’s one that costs a fortune, doesn’t even sound good. At least let it sound good. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb [inaudible 01:23:51] the moment of [inaudible 01:23:53]. That is why I’ve asked Congress [inaudible 01:23:56] extreme late term abortion, because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Donald Trump: (01:24:17)
Democrats are now the party of high taxes. Think of it. They want to raise your taxes. How does that work? I guess I’m old-fashioned. I’ve only been doing this for three [inaudible 00:16:28]. I’m not experienced like other. A Senator came up, “Sir, I’ve run seven different [inaudible 01:24:33] won five times.” I said, “I’ve done one, but I’ve won. But it’s the beep.” But no, seriously, we’re all smart people. How is it good when they say, “We’re going to raise your taxes?” Is the world going crazy? They say, “We’re going to raise your taxes. We’re going to open borders. Everybody can come in … for everybody’s health insurance. Schooling. You know, one time … we’re going to get everybody a Rolls Royce, and CNN or one of them said, “They never said, and they never promised a Rolls Royce. Donald Trump lied tonight.” I said, “Every illegal alien will have a Rolls Royce.” They said, “He lied tonight.” These people are sick.
Donald Trump: (01:25:26)
But they’re the party of late term abortion, socialism and corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American Dream, and of course, honest Abe Lincoln, right? Republicans are fighting for citizens from every background and from every race, religion, color, and creed. We are a movement. There’s a movement like nobody’s ever seen before. You know, when I mention this, anything I say that’s even slightly false, it’s headlines. “Trump said this. These people. He said this.” This is one of the greatest … I would say this. This is the greatest movement in the history of our country. I really believe that. Never been a movement like this.
Donald Trump: (01:26:16)
I mean, there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of nowhere won the state of New Hampshire, won Iowa, won South Carolina down the way, won a state some place. But we won 32 states. There’s never been a movement like this, never happened before. But we’re a movement for all Americans who believe in fairness and justice, equality and dignity, opportunity and safety. We are a big tent and we are a big party of big ideas for the future. That’s why African Americans are joining the Republican Party like nobody ever thought even possible. They love us and we love them.
Donald Trump: (01:27:10)
And to give former prisoners a second chance at life, we passed. It was us, not the Democrats. They came to me, they wanted help, I gave them help. I got it done. I called Republicans that maybe wouldn’t have been so inclined, some of them. Some of them very much inclined. Some of them very conservative were very much inclined. But I got the people that we needed. Obama couldn’t do it. Bush couldn’t do it. Nobody could do it. I got it approved, and from the day it was approved, I got no thanks, I got no credit. And that’s okay, because you know, right? But we passed bi-partisan criminal justice reform and that’s helped so many people.
Donald Trump: (01:28:01)
I mean, you know the story of Alice Johnson. You know so many different stories. It’s helped so many people, especially in the African-American community, the Hispanic community. It’s helped a lot of people. It’s a different world. To uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 187 federal judges, a record, who will interpret the constitution as written. 187. Last spring, Wisconsin voters, as you know, elected a great judge to your State Supreme Court, and this spring you have a chance to reelect another terrific judge, Justice Daniel Kelly. Go vote for Justice Daniel Kelly to defend the rule of law in Wisconsin. Daniel Kelly. We are aggressively combating the opioid epidemic and we’ve done great … Look, until you get rid of it, you never did great, but we have done numbers that nobody thought possible. In 2018, drug overdose deaths, the overdose deaths, fell for the first time in decades, including by 10% in the state of Wisconsin, 17, 18, 19 and even 21% in a couple of states. China is now putting a big stop, a big lid on Fentanyl, which is a disaster coming out of China. Said to president, “You’ve got to do it. People are dying, got to do it.” They’re doing it. We are fighting very hard for school choice and it’s moving along well in Wisconsin. Milwaukee created the first school choice program 30 years ago to free children for failing government schools, and now my administration is working to give school choice to every child in America who needs it.
Donald Trump: (01:30:16)
As we continue rebuilding our military, workers are building brand new Humvee replacements … you know about that … in Oshkosh and magnificent new little old combat ships in Marinette. A lot of ships, a lot of Humvees. I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. We recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, something they’ve been trying to get for 52 years. For years you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for you, the people of Wisconsin.
Donald Trump: (01:31:16)
At stake in our present battle is the survival of the nation. What these people are doing, they will destroy our nation. They will destroy our nation. And our last election was so important. I don’t know, maybe the most important ever, but it was so important. I really believe that this election maybe in its own way will be just as important. I can’t say more, but just as important, because we need time for that tree to grow. You plant a tree and it takes time. We need time for that tree to grow, and we have other things that we want to do. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020. Have to do it.
Donald Trump: (01:32:07)
Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all, and I have found out what a swamp it is. Bad people. I have become the expert all what a swamp. You know, when I used to say, “Drain the swamp,” I had no idea it would be that bad. But we’re winning. We’re here and they’re not. We’re winning. We’re winning. Bad people. Dishonest, bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration, which now we’re already doing. We’re already doing a lot of it.
Donald Trump: (01:33:06)
You’ve got to get loopholes. You know, you need their votes. We have loopholes, like visa lottery. We put names in a lottery and they come in, they become American citizens. Do you think these countries are giving us their finest? “Oh, let’s give them our best citizens, put them in.” These people are crazy to allow this to happen, so we’re stopping it all. But ending catch and release was a very big thing, and we did that with no Democrat help. They wouldn’t do it. It’s called loopholes. Who wouldn’t want to end loopholes?
Donald Trump: (01:33:36)
We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.” We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America in less than 10 years. Who would’ve thought that? We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms.
Donald Trump: (01:34:19)
And above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” They’ll always be there. We’ll never let up remove it. Those words will always be there.
Donald Trump: (01:35:27)
From Milwaukee to Monroe, from Bayfield to Green Bay, good luck this weekend. And from West Bend to West Dallas, we stand on the shoulders of the most courageous men and women ever to walk on the face of the earth. Our American ancestors crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, revolutionized industry, pioneered science, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, landed men on the face of the moon, and made America the greatest nation in the history of the world, and we are making it greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Wisconsin, the best is yet to come. You watch. Because working together, we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Wisconsin. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:37:58)

"Jan 8, 2020",11:24 A.M. EST,"Donald Trump: (00:15)
As long as I’m president of the United States Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. Good morning. I’m pleased to inform you, the American people should be extremely grateful and happy. No Americans were harmed in last night’s attack by the Iranian regime. We suffered no casualties. All of our soldiers are safe,, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world. No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of forces, and an early warning system that worked very well.
Donald Trump: (01:24)
I salute the incredible skill and courage of America’s men and women in uniform. For far too long, all the way back to 1979 to be exact, nations have tolerated Iran’s destructive, and destabilizing behavior in the middle East and beyond. Those days are over. Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism, and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that happen. Last week, we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American lives. At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Quasem Soleimani. As the head of the Quds force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely worst atrocities.
Donald Trump: (02:31)
He trained terrorists armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian targets. He fueled bloody civil Wars all across the region. He viciously wounded, and murdered thousands of US troops, including the planting of roadside bombs that may him and dismember their victims. Soleimani directed the recent attacks on US personnel in Iraq, that badly wounded for service members, and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on the US Embassy in Baghdad. In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him.
Donald Trump: (03:17)
Soleimani’s hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. He should have been terminated long ago. By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists. If you value your own life, you will not threaten the lives of our people. As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes it’s behavior. In recent months alone Iran’s sea ships in international waters fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down to US drones. Iran’s hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. Instead of saying thank you to the United States, they chanted death to America.
Donald Trump: (04:33)
In fact, they chanted death to America the day the agreement was signed. Then Iran went on a terrorist spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The missiles fired last night at us, and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration. The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country. Even recently killing 1500 people, at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran. The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway, and gives a ran a clear and quick path to nuclear breakout.
Donald Trump: (05:30)
Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize this reality. They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal, or JCPOA, and we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer, and more peaceful place. We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential. Iran can be a great country. Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as the Iran continues to foment violence, unrest, hatred and war. The civilized world, must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime. Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. It will not be allowed to go forward.
Donald Trump: (06:45)
Today, I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process. Over the last three years. Under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before, and America’s achieved energy independence. These historic accomplishments shades our strategic priorities. These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible, and options in the Middle East became available. We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. We are independent and we do not need Middle East oil. The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of two point $5 trillion. US armed forces are stronger than ever before.
Donald Trump: (07:41)
Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast. Under construction, are many hypersonic missiles. The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military, and economic is the best deterrent. Three months ago after destroying 100% of ISIS, and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi who is responsible for so much death, including the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way. He was a monster. al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate and failed. Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration.
Donald Trump: (08:49)
ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other shared priorities. Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future and a great future, one that you deserve. One of prosperity at home, and harmony with the nations of the world. The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. I want to thank you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you."
"Nov 3, 2019",1:47 P.M.  EDT,"Speaker 1: (03:53)
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump.
Donald Trump: (04:04)
Well, thank you very much. And hello, Tupelo. This is great to be with you tonight, the great state of Mississippi. The great state of Mississippi, and by the way, the birthplace of a gentleman, not too many people heard of him, Elvis Presley. But to be with thousands of incredible patriots who put their faith in God, family and country. Right?
Donald Trump: (07:16)
Four days from now, this state will head to the polls and vote to continue our extraordinary progress with your next governor, Republican Tate Reeves. Great guy. Great guy. Under Republican leadership, jobs are booming, confidence is soaring, wages are rising, crime is falling, and our nation is stronger than ever before. We’re now an economic powerhouse. We’ve never been in a position like it. We’ve rebuilt our military and we have financial strength. And by the way, for those of you with a thing called 401ks, the stock market hit, today, another all-time historic high.
Donald Trump: (08:18)
Unemployment in Mississippi has reached the lowest rate ever recorded, ever recorded. That’s not bad. That’s not bad when you’re on the debate stage and you say, “We have the best economy we’ve ever had. We have the best military we’ve ever had, the best unemployment and employment numbers we’ve ever had.”
Audience: (08:45)
The best president [inaudible 00:08:43].
Donald Trump: (08:46)
Said, “Got the best president we’ve ever had.” Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Audience: (09:13)
Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!
Donald Trump: (09:13)
Thank you very much. And very importantly, we’ve confirmed more than 158 brand new, beautiful federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. In a very short while, we’ll have 182 federal judges. President Obama left us 142. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, President Obama. He left us 142 openings. Can you believe that? You’re supposed to leave none when you leave office, but that didn’t work out too well. And just days ago, the United States brought the world’s number one terrorist leader to justice.
Audience: (10:03)
USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA. USA.
Donald Trump: (10:24)
We have great military. It was very, very depleted. When I came into office, it was very, very depleted, but it ain’t depleted anymore. Yep. al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader… Look, you’ve heard about it for a long time. I kept saying, “Where is al-Baghdadi? That’s the one I want. Where is he?” And then, by the way, the following day, we got number two. I don’t know if you read about that. But he was the founder and the leader of ISIS, and he’s dead. And Baghdadi, he was a Savage and soulless monster, but his reign of terror is over. American special operators executed a masterful raid that ended his wretched life and punched out his ticket to hell, I guess you could say. He spent his last miserable moments on Earth cowering and trembling and crying in fear of the American warrior that was right there going right up. No enemy stands a chance against the righteous bite of the United States military, and Mississippi loves our military, that I can tell you. And our military loves Mississippi.
Donald Trump: (12:07)
America is winning again, and America is all, over the world, respected again. It’s about time. But while we’re creating jobs and killing terrorists, the Democrat party has gone completely insane.
Audience: (12:24)
Boo.
Donald Trump: (12:30)
The radical left is determined to transform America into a country you would not recognize. We are the ones standing in their way, and we will never get out of their way. It will be easy. From even before we won the election, the far-left Democrats and the fake news media right back there… Look at all of them, oh. It’s too bad we get such good ratings because if we didn’t, they wouldn’t be here. Look at how many. It’s like the Academy Awards before it failed. Right? And you know why it failed? Because they disrespected us.
Donald Trump: (13:26)
But the media and the Democrats have been engaged in a corrupt partnership, trying to impose their will and to thwart American democracy by any means necessary. You see what’s going on. First, they engineered the Russia hoax. That was a total hoax, the single greatest lies ever foisted upon the American people. Then the Mueller witch hunt, it never ended. With 18 angry Democrats and an unlimited budget, let’s go get him. That didn’t work out too well, did it? That fizzled. And a lot of bad people along the way.
Audience: (14:15)
They never learn.
Donald Trump: (14:16)
And now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi-
Audience: (14:23)
Boo.
Donald Trump: (14:23)
… and shifty Adam Schiff, Shifty. And the media are continuing with the deranged impeachment witch hunt. This is one I never thought I’d be involved in. The word impeachment… To me, it’s a dirty word, not a good word. Totally phony deal. They know it. Everybody knows it, and that’s why we’ve never had greater support than we have right now. It’s true. And if you think you have a lot of people in this room, all you have to do is go outside. You’ll see a lot more people trying to get in. So if anybody wants to give up your seat, please just walk out. Anybody want to leave?
Audience: (15:13)
No.
Donald Trump: (15:13)
Because there really is. There’s no place better to have a rally, to have a good time, and to also, at the same time, be very serious than at a Trump rally, especially on Friday night in Mississippi. We could have done this one on Monday night. I said, “Let’s do Friday.” Right? Yesterday, the Democrats voted to potentially nullify the votes of 63 million Americans, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives.
Audience: (15:57)
Boo.
Donald Trump: (15:57)
They’ve been plotting to overthrow the election since the moment I won. But the people here that are highly sophisticated, though, long before I won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, the horrible newspaper, fake, fake, fake Washington Post, declared, “The campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun.” At least they gave us 19 minutes. Yesterday’s vote by the radical Democrats is an attack on democracy itself. But I’ll tell you, the Republicans are really strong, the strongest I’ve ever seen them, the most unified I’ve ever seen them. Right? The most unified I’ve ever seen them. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, and extremism. The Democrats’ outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote many do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020.
Donald Trump: (17:22)
Make no mistake. They are coming after the Republican party and me because I’m fighting for you. They don’t like it. This is different. They’ve never had anything like this. Well, they’ve never had an election like 2016 either, have they? They never have. They’ve never quite figured it out.
Audience: (17:43)
You’re the man.
Donald Trump: (17:43)
And they know they can’t win, so let’s try and impeach him. How about that crazy representative, Al Green, right? “You know, we got to impeach him because we can’t beat him.” I don’t think so. Right? I don’t think so. Al Green, he’s another beauty. The Democrats, the media, and the deep state are desperate to stop us. And it’s not me, it’s us. It’s all of us. It’s 63 million, but it’s much more than 63 million. Much more. And right now, our numbers are higher than they’ve ever been before. They’ve never been this high. But they want to stop us because they know we are here, and that’s what we’re doing, and that’s what’s taking up so much time. We’re draining the swamp in Washington.
Donald Trump: (18:45)
Nothing terrifies Democrats more than the fact that all of their spying… Spying. They actually spied on my campaign. Can you believe it? I mean, you know, they try and say, “Well, we were actually just checking things out. Oh, that’s wonderful.”
Audience: (19:00)
Lock them up.
Donald Trump: (19:01)
The lying, the falsifying over the past three years plus, before I ever even announced they were spying. I guess they knew we were going to win, right? But over that past more than three years is finally being exposed. And remember this, that truth is a force of nature. Desperate to conceal their misdeeds, the Democrats are now attacking us for calling out the grave corruption of the Bidens, just like they melted down when we pointed out crooked Hillary’s shocking and very many misdeeds.
Audience: (19:46)
Lock her up.
Donald Trump: (19:47)
33,000 emails. 33,000 emails disappeared, but she said they only had to do with her working out at her daughter’s wedding. 33.
Audience: (20:15)
Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up. Lock her up.
Donald Trump: (20:21)
She’s a beauty. How about last week? Did you hear? I don’t know who Tulsi Gabbard is, but I know one thing. She’s not an agent of Russia. And Jill Stein, she’s a greenie. That’s fine. We love the environment, everybody in this room. You know, right now we have the cleanest air and the cleanest water that we’ve ever had, and yet we’re number one in the world in energy, by far. We took over.
Donald Trump: (20:54)
But I don’t know Jill Stein. She ran last time. I don’t know, but I know she’s not an agent of Russia. And when Hillary made those statements, two statements, both of them, “They work for Russia, they’re agents of…” I said, “You know, when she made that statement about me three years ago, it took me two years to get out of that hoax statement.” She made it about them. Everybody laughed because of what we proved. But I’ll tell you what, these are very bad people. These are very dishonest people, and the media is worse than all of them.
Donald Trump: (21:41)
But think about the preposterous hoax the Democrats are now trying to peddle. I’ve just beaten, with no… Look, look, we didn’t have too much political experience. I did a good job, built lots of buildings all over the place, had great success in show business. Just did one show. It was called The Apprentice, and it was a big success. 14 seasons. And when I left, Crazy Arnold took over. It didn’t do too well. It was dead. It was dead from the first episode. I saw him, I said, “Oh, it’s terrible. What have they done to this beautiful show?” Arnold?
Audience: (21:46)
Let him go.
Donald Trump: (21:48)
But think of it. I’ve just beaten, with no political experience, the Clinton dynasty, the Bush dynasty, the President Barack Hussein Obama dynasty.
Audience: (22:43)
Boo.
Donald Trump: (22:47)
And President Obama worked harder at defeating me than crooked Hillary Clinton did, right? He was all over the place. It’s the only time I’ve actually seen him work hard, when it came to trying to beat Trump. True. True. Remember he said… Remember he said, “He will not be president”? Well, that didn’t work out so well. And then they figured they could take us out a different way, very dishonesty, right, with the lying and the spying and the leaking. And we are kicking their ass. I’ll tell you.
Donald Trump: (23:37)
In the delusional Democrat fantasy, I’m now supposed to be afraid of someone called 1% Joe. I used to call him 1% because you could never get 1% in the primaries. Then he got brought out by Obama out of the trash heap, became vice president. But we’ve now named him Very Slow, Sleepy Joe. Very slow. He’s gotten slower and slower. I’m afraid if he gets a nomination, he’ll be so slow we’ll have the lowest-rated debates in history as opposed to the highest-rated debates in history against crooked Hillary. In fact, I don’t even think that Sleepy Joe will get it. But many people are running. So, you know, it’s so early. I don’t want to talk about their campaign.
Donald Trump: (24:37)
Oh, did you hear Beto? Beto? Did you hear Beto? Beto. Oh, that poor bastard. Well, poor, pathetic guy. He was pathetic. Remember the arms a-flailing? Remember that? You know, he ran against Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz won. He spent almost 100 million dollars, and Ted Cruz… And I helped Ted, and we campaigned together, and it was good. But I used to watch him. Then when he came onto the really big stage, this crazy stage, I noticed he was flailing with the arms, and he was standing on tables. He was standing on countertops. I said, “Does he ever stand on the floor and speak?” But he’s waving his arms and going crazy, and I said, “What the hell is he doing? What is he on?” And do you remember he made the statement that he was born for this? Anybody that says he was born for this, they’re in trouble.
Donald Trump: (25:43)
I used to have guys come into my office, “Sir, I’m the greatest salesman. Nobody can sell…” You know, the truth is anybody that says they’re a great salesman, usually they’re not a very good salesman. It’s true. It’s those sneaky ones in the back that don’t talk, that you don’t know about. They’re the ones. But Beto was nasty, and he said that he was born for it, like he was born from heaven. He came down. And if that’s the case, some really bad things happen, because he made a total fool out of himself.
Donald Trump: (26:18)
And he came out of Texas, the great state of Texas. He came out of Texas, a very hot political property, and he went back as cold as you can be. So he was a nasty guy, but he had a couple of policies that don’t work well in the state of Texas. Right? He was against religion. He was against you having a gun.
Audience: (26:49)
Boo.
Donald Trump: (26:54)
And he was against oil. So you come from Texas, you don’t like religion, you don’t like oil, and you don’t have guns. I don’t know. That’s not a good combination in the state of Texas. That’s not good in Mississippi, either. I don’t know it’s that good anywhere. Nah, he went back home to Texas, and hopefully we won’t be hearing about him for a long time. It’s amazing how cold you could get so quickly, but he was a nasty guy. But in the twist…
Audience: (27:27)
Alabama.
Donald Trump: (27:27)
Oh, Alabama. Love Alabama. I love Alabama. I love Alabama. It’s a great place. But in the very twisted and corrupt world of Adam Schiff, after beating the entire political establishment, and that means Bush and that means Clinton and that means Obama, they have me supposedly saying to myself, “Well, let’s see. I got a guy named Sleepy Joe Biden. How do I beat him? How do I beat him? How do I beat this guy? He’s such a great.” Clinton, she was easy. Right? Obama was easy. The Bush dynasty was. But sleepy Joe, I’m worried about, right?
Donald Trump: (28:19)
So then I said to myself, “Gee, I guess there’s only one way. Let’s call up Ukraine for help.
Audience: (28:31)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (28:31)
These people are sick. These people are sick. Now, these dishonest people will take the last little sliver and the first little sliver and they’ll put it, because they’re so damn dishonest, and they’ll just say-
Audience: (28:47)
Boo. Boo.
Donald Trump: (28:48)
… “Let’s use Ukraine for help.” That’s what they’re going to say. And they won’t show the laughter, and they won’t show the sarcasm, and they won’t show the fun because they’re the most dishonorable people almost on earth. It’s a disgrace. But we say it anyway. And here’s the good news. The people get it.
Donald Trump: (29:13)
So they have a brand new president in Ukraine. Good guy, by the way. And I call a brand new person, a man I have no idea who he is, and I’m on a phone, right? And I know many people are on the phone because when you call the leaders of country, many people listen. And I’m on the phone, and they want me to say to this brand new president, just got there, called to congratulate him, “Please, could you help me please?” I don’t know who he is. I didn’t know his name until I looked down the card, I see. And he’s a nice guy, and hopefully he’s going to root out corruption because Ukraine has tremendous corruption problems. And one of the reasons I held up money, very important, corruption. But the other reason… Why isn’t Germany and France and UK and all of these European nations that are right there… Why aren’t they doing things that they’re supposed to do? Why is it always the United States?
Donald Trump: (30:23)
So I made this call, had this wonderful call, and the transcript proves it was, as I said, perfect. It was perfect. It wasn’t like almost… It was perfect. It was totally appropriate. I made it at the behest of people to say, “Could you call and say hello?” Now I’m an honest person, anyway. But do you think, when I’m making a call to a newly-elected president of a country, that I would say something improper when I know there are so many people listening on the line? Many people.
Donald Trump: (31:03)
… people listening on the line. I’ve many people, all of these people. You had the Secretary of State Pompeo, great guy. He’s listening. You had transcribers, fortunately. You had policy experts, junior aids, low-level staffers, probably [apprenti 00:00:20]. Whoever the hell wants to listen, they listen, and they have me making some kind of a deal with all these people. And remember, the new president of Ukraine is speaking to the United States of America, the president. I guarantee he’s got a lot of people listening, too. These people are sick.
Donald Trump: (31:38)
So corrupt politician, Shifty Adam Schiff, actually stood before Congress and stood before the American people and made up a conversation that he said I had with the Ukrainian president. Unfortunately … No, think of it. And many people saw that, and it was a terrible … He said terrible things. The president of Ukraine said it was a very good conversation, there was no pressure. His foreign minister said the same thing: no pressure. They must think we’re nuts, to be honest. It’s all a phony deal, this whole impeachment scam, to try to undermine the 2020 election and to de-legitimatize one of the greatest elections, maybe the greatest … I mean, let’s give George Washington credit, but everybody expected he was going to win, that we’ve ever had.
Donald Trump: (32:45)
So my phone call, which was totally perfect and appropriate, and if you want to read the transcript, you see how perfect it was, but they don’t quit. But what you should do is take a look at the behavior of Sleepy Joe. So I quote, “I said” … Let me act like him. I’ve got to speak really slow though, and … “I said, ‘You’re not getting a billion.’ I looked at them and I said, ‘I’m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor isn’t fired, you’re not getting the money. You understand? You’re not getting the money.'” Then he goes, at the end … I didn’t know he had this kind of energy. He goes, “Well, son of a bitch, he got fired.”
Donald Trump: (33:37)
You know, in a certain way, I was impressed because, I mean, I didn’t think he had the energy, the brain power. It’s turned out he doesn’t. By the way, he’s dropping like a rock. When you’re at 1%, there’s always a reason. He should be there fairly soon. As you know, the Ukrainian prosecutor that Biden got fired after threatening to withhold, I think it was $1 billion or something in aid, was the prosecutor investigating his son’s company, that was paying Hunter Biden, a guy just got thrown out of the Navy … He was paying them millions of dollars, even though, working for an energy company, he had no experience with energy. He knew less about it than this young … How old are you?
Speaker 2: (34:27)
[inaudible 00:03:28].
Donald Trump: (34:29)
Six. This young, beautiful person in front of me.
Crowd: (34:41)
Go, Donald, go.
Donald Trump: (34:44)
Six. And this young six-year-old is smarter, so I think I’d basically go with her. So what is it all about? It’s called a payoff, but you know what? The fake news, they apologize. I watched this horrible guy who gets lousy ratings, Anderson Cooper. Well, the hatred, I mean, between him and Fredo. You’ve got Fredo and … That’s Cuomo, Fredo. I call him Fredo, like from the movie.
Donald Trump: (35:25)
Now I watched Anderson Cooper and I watched him apologize for even asking the question to Biden. The good news is Biden didn’t know too much about what the hell he was talking about. Remember Biden said, “I don’t know these people. I don’t know them. I don’t know them.”
Donald Trump: (35:40)
He never spoke to his son about getting millions of dollars. No, he never spoke to him. Didn’t happen to speak to him. Think of this: we’re dealing with life, right? He never spoke to him. Unfortunately, the next day … In the world of the internet, in the world of smart people … That’s why I like Beto, he wasn’t smart, couldn’t handle it. I told my wife, I said, “See, it’s not so easy.”
Donald Trump: (36:02)
I told our great First Lady tonight, who people love. They love her. When Beto quit, he quit like a dog. When he quit I said, “See, people think this is easy. This isn’t easy,” but it just worked out that way.
Donald Trump: (36:26)
But Biden said, “I never met the people, never met the gentlemen.” Unfortunately, in about 10 seconds, a picture came out where they’re playing golf together, but he never met him. So now you’ll ask him, he’ll say, “No, we played around a golf. We were together for three hours. I never mentioned the fact that they’re paying my son millions.” Oh, no, no, no.
Donald Trump: (36:49)
But the press protection: watch this crazy Anderson Cooper. Third-rate. Lousy ratings. Third-rate person. But listen, CNN, the worst. I mean, the worst. The worst. Oh, the light just went off, see? Look. The light was on, they just turned. They don’t like it. It’s tough. You’re fake, CNN. No, it’s tough. I tried not to do that because I see their light on. When their light goes on, that means you’re live. No, that means you’re live. And every time, it’s tough. Look, in all fairness, they’re putting it on. It’s a broadcast. Very few people are [inaudible 00:37:37] … Well, they might be watching us. I guess they do watch us.
Donald Trump: (37:40)
But here’s the thing. And then you have the guy up there saying that they’re fake, that they’re no good, that they’re liars and cheaters, that they’re phoneys. It’s hard to be broadcasting that when you’re talking about the network that has you on, right? So, we understand. Their light’s off. And then, remember this: Anderson [inaudible 00:00:38:06]. He used to interview me. He was so nice. Prior to running for politics, he was so nice to me. It was like they were love fests, but I don’t want anything to do with him. They were love fests. What a thought. He’s weak. He’s a weak person, but they’re all weak. But let me just tell you something. We need honesty with our media.
Donald Trump: (38:31)
We need honesty, because the New York Times, the Washington Post … And by the way, I don’t know, you probably read it. We threw them out at the White House. We don’t show them anymore. If somebody wants to go and buy them; we threw them out. And they came into my office and then I got to get back to this guy. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? We had a tee shirt made, “Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter?”
Donald Trump: (38:58)
Poor Hunter. He then came out, he did the Morning Show. That was the last we’ve seen of Hunter. That wasn’t good. The morning of his father’s very bad debate, but it’s, where is Hunter? But before I say the final thing on Hunter and then we put him to rest for a while, we got rid of the Washington Post and the failing New York Times. We got rid of them, right? We don’t have them in the White House. I said, “No, you could … People can go out and buy them, but we don’t” …
Donald Trump: (39:27)
We used to have them stacked up, and I’d go in and I’d see a meeting with my people and they’re dealing with China, South Korea, or somebody. And I’d go into these offices; I’d see 10 or 15 of them packed up all over the place, the Washington Post, and the New York Times. I keep trying to figure out who’s worse. And one day it’s the Times, one day it’s the Post. It’s like top each other, they’re so bad. It’s so phony. In my opinion, it’s virtually corrupt. I’ve never seen it. You never have a good story. I mean, even when we got al-Baghdadi, the Washington Post had a story that he was like a great religious cleric. Where did that come from?
Donald Trump: (40:12)
The other thing, if Obama would have done it … because, look. This guy built ISIS. The caliphate, it was the size physically of Ohio, the state of Ohio, the great state of Ohio. That’s a big, lot of land. 7 million people, and they were the ones, the orange jumpsuits. I called a lot of the parents after we did this and I talked to them and they were … How can you be happy? But they were so thrilled that we got this animal. They were so thrilled. But you know what? And you know what? We don’t do it for … We do it because it’s right.
Donald Trump: (40:46)
That story was a massive story. That was the biggest, maybe the biggest, one of the biggest, ever. Bigger than anything. That story disappeared so fast. Done. And that’s okay. I didn’t do it for the story. I did it because it’s the right thing to do. But if I were a Democrat, they’d be talking about that story for weeks. With me, they don’t even want to … They actually played it down. And actually, and I’m happy about this, Conan the dog got more publicity than me. And I’m very happy with that. I’m very … Conan is incredible. And Conan’s coming to the White House in a few weeks.
Donald Trump: (41:37)
But it is true. Did you ever see a story disappear so fast? I mean, if Obama had that story, that thing would be going on for another seven months. They’d be talking about his bravery. Oh, so bravery. But again, 142 judges he gave us. Remember that. How can you be a great … They always say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges. We got two Supreme Courts. Great ones. Great judge. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, great judges. By the way, did you ever see any human being treated worse than now-Justice Kavanaugh? Did anybody ever? Was any human being by these people, these horrible, horrible people that we have to deal with?
Donald Trump: (42:26)
Anyway, just to finish. So Hunter then goes to China. Now I’m dealing with China right now. They don’t like me too much. They dream about the day when somebody else … And would they like to have … How about this? You give this son, who has zero experience with investing, too, you give him $1.5 billion to invest, meaning he makes millions and millions of dollars, and the biggest guys on Wall Street can’t get it. He walks out with $1.5 billion. And then there are other places also, I understand. Folks, it’s disgraceful that the press doesn’t cover it for what it is. It’s a payoff. It’s a payoff.
Donald Trump: (43:10)
And how would you like to have Sleepy Joe, with the son getting all of this money from China, become president and take over the China deal? They are not liking me. They had the worst year that they’ve had in 57 years. Their supply chain is broken up like scrambled eggs and they want to make a deal because those tariffs have given us millions of dollars and billions now, billions and billions of dollars. We’re taking billions and billions of dollars, and you know what we’re doing with some of it? Just a small portion, but 100%, they’re taking care of … Our farmers got $16 billion last year and $12 billion the year before because they targeted our farmers, because they know the farmers love Trump and Trump loves the farmers. So they targeted them and they brought the $16 billion down to practically nothing. And they thought our farmers would say, “Oh, we don’t like Trump.” They did just the opposite. They said, “We know he’s doing the right thing because we’ve been ripped off for so many years.”
Donald Trump: (44:22)
But I said to him, I said to Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Purdue, a great guy; I said, “Sonny, how much did they spend buying our corn and soy beans and all of our agricultural product?”
Donald Trump: (44:35)
He said, “Sir, $16 billion.”
Donald Trump: (44:37)
I said, “Good, I’ll make it up.”
Donald Trump: (44:39)
And we’re going to have a lot leftover. So we will have, pretty soon, over $100 billion in money paid into the United States Treasury by a country that never gave us 25 cents. They only took. They only took. So when I said to the farmers, “We’re going to send you $16 billion, and it’s already been sent. And it’s been split into $12 billion the year before.” I mean, think of that, $28 billion. I said, “Compliments of China.”
Donald Trump: (45:18)
And we had a lot left over. Not bad, right? Not bad. You think Obama would do that? I don’t think so. You think Hillary would do that? I don’t think so. You think Sleepy Joe would do that? I don’t think so. He wouldn’t know what you’re talking about.
Donald Trump: (45:34)
On Tuesday, the proud people of Mississippi will send Democrats a clear message. It’s very important for this reason, as well as the fact that you have a great gentleman in your midst. But you have to reject their extremism and their socialism and their corruption. They’re corrupt. Adam Schiff is a corrupt politician. You know when he made that phony speech where he made up a really horrible speech and said that I said it, I said, “Oh, I’m going to sue him.”
Donald Trump: (46:05)
They said, “Sir, I’m sorry. You can’t.”
Donald Trump: (46:07)
He’s got total immunity because he made it in Congress. Can you believe this? But here’s the good news. At least we have a forum, we have a place we can talk so everyone knows what’s going on. A bunch of phony people, but this is why we have to send a signal and why you have to make Tate Reeves your great, new Republican … Right? Republican governor, right?
Donald Trump: (46:34)
Hey, he’s a great guy, too. And all I know is he’s loved and respected by your current governor, because Phil is some piece of work. Phil is so confident. I wanted Phil to run for a certain office, then I wanted him to do something. I’ve tried to get him, but some guys are confident. Phil said, “No sir, I’ve been doing this all my life. I love the people.” He built the most beautiful African-American museum. Phil, he’s the greatest, but he built the most beautiful … But he’s got confidence. And he said, “No sir, I’d been doing it. I don’t really want to do that.” In other words, he said, “That’s enough.”
Donald Trump: (47:16)
Most people are so insecure, they keep going and going and going. It’s not good. I like Phil’s attitude better. But Phil is great, but I’m going to introduce Phil in a second. But Tate Reeves, who Phil endorses and views as a champion for your state and, really, a champion for Mississippi values. And Tate helped cut your taxes over 50 times, including the largest tax cut in Mississippi history. Tate is pro-worker, he’s pro-jobs, he’s pro-family, he’s pro-life. Tate is a true leader in the fight to protect the unborn. The other side is not. Tate Reeves will support our police, oppose sanctuary [inaudible 00:48:21] … Oh, we love our police, right? I love our police. We love our police.
Donald Trump: (48:27)
He’ll oppose sanctuary cities, which is just terrible. They’re terrible. And Tate will always defend your Second Amendment. So Tate’s running against a liberal Democrat named Jim Hood. Now all I know about Jim Hood is he fought very hard to elect crooked Hillary Clinton and Barack Hussein Obama. Isn’t that nice? He wanted Obama to win so badly and then he wanted Hillary to win. And that’s not the kind of guy we need here. Not in Mississippi. He’s supported by extreme leftists like Stacey Abrams, who, by the way went down to defeat in front of a terrific gentlemen from the great state of Georgia, Brian Kemp. And they came in with … Oh, they brought them all. They had President Obama, they had Michelle Obama, they had Oprah Winfrey. They came in, and all he had was Donald Trump, and we won. We won, fairly easily.
Donald Trump: (49:51)
But Stacey Abrams wants to give illegal aliens the right to vote. Do you believe this? I mean, some of these people, they want to give them education. They want to give them this. They want to give them free healthcare. They want to give these people, that come into our country illegally-
Crowd: (50:10)
Kick them out.
Donald Trump: (50:10)
… more advantages than our own citizens have, more advantages than our own military has. Jim Hood wants to raise your taxes. He supports taxpayer funding for abortion providers. He supports illegal immigration [inaudible 00:50:35] all benefits, and he opposed our travel ban, which is so important that we won in the United States Supreme Court to keep terrorists the hell out of our country.
Donald Trump: (50:54)
And Jim Hood went to the United Nations and opposed your right to self-defense. If you don’t want a far left Democrat running Mississippi … Wait a minute. How’s this guy? I can’t believe this is a competitive race. It’s embarrassing. I’m talking to Mississippi. I’m talking to Mississippi. I can’t believe it. I don’t think that he’s going to be the right guy. I think the guy that you want is Tate Reeves. He’s going to be fantastic. He will be a great, great governor. Tate, come on up. Tate.
Crowd: (51:36)
Tate, Tate, Tate, Tate.
Tate Reeves: (51:59)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (51:59)
[crosstalk 00:51:55].
Tate Reeves: (52:02)
Thank you, Mr. President. Mississippi welcomes you, because Mississippi is Donald J. Trump country. We gave you almost 60% of the vote in 2016, and next year we’re going to do even better. And the reason is because President Trump is a strong leader. He is the right leader to defeat the radical liberals who have taken over the Democratic Party. Now these radical liberals have been trying to remove our president from office since the very day he was sworn in. They have disrespected him, and that means they have disrespected us. Jim Hood does not stand with our president. He stands with the radical liberals.
Crowd: (53:14)
[inaudible 00:22:15].
Tate Reeves: (53:14)
When the radical liberals tried to stop the president on border security, Jim Hood stood with the liberals.
Crowd: (53:30)
Build the wall.
Tate Reeves: (53:30)
When the choice was Donald J. Trump or Crooked Hillary, Jim Hood stood with Hillary Clinton. And today, with the election just days away, I’m standing with President Donald Trump, and Jim Hood is standing with the liberals. Now, Mississippi, it is time to choose. It is time to stand up and be counted. Are we going to stand with President Donald Trump? Are you going to stand with me on Tuesday? Let’s stand up to keep America great. Let’s stand up to elect a conservative that will be an ally to President Donald J. Trump. I need your prayers. I need your support and, most importantly, on Tuesday, I need your vote. Thank y’all.
Crowd: (54:50)
[inaudible 00:54:57].
Donald Trump: (55:03)
Thank you, Tate. Tuesday, go out and vote for Tate. He’ll never let you down. And don’t kid yourself. Your Second Amendment is under attack, but not with him. It’s under attack. So we’re also joined tonight by a man who is truly, and I’ve sort of said it a lot, but he’s been a great governor and he loves your state. He loves the people of this great state, Governor Phil Bryant. Where’s Phil? Come up, Phil. Come up.
Donald Trump: (55:37)
Oh, he’s central casting. Look at him. Come here, Phil.
Phil Bryant: (55:41)
All right, I just want to say one more thing. Is this Trump country? This has been the greatest president of my lifetime. And let me tell you why. What we always wanted was a fighter. We said somebody should stand up to the Democrats and fight. Well, this is what fighting looks like. Let’s go make America great again.
Crowd: (56:13)
[inaudible 00:56:13] U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A, U.S.A.
Donald Trump: (56:31)
Thank you, Phil. Thank you. Thank you, my Phil. What a job. What a great job. You have to continue that whole thing going forward. So another man who’s a warrior is a friend of mine. Whenever there’s a problem, he’s there. He’s always there. He’ll be right at the front. He is tough. He is smart. He’s brilliant, actually. And he loves this state and he loves you people. Senator Roger Wicker. Roger.
Donald Trump: (57:11)
Thanks, Roger. Thank you, Roger. And somebody, I’ll call her up because, believe it or not, she’s running with me. She just ran. I said, “Cindy, you just ran. You just won.”
Donald Trump: (57:22)
She said, “No, I have to do it again.”
Donald Trump: (57:24)
She’s running in 2020. I thought she’d have six years. I said, “Cindy, it’s only like a year.” Cindy Hyde-Smith. She’s incredible. She’s tough and smart and strong, and she’s with us all the way. Cindy Hyde-Smith.
Cindy H-S: (57:49)
Is this guy incredible or what? We have got a president we can be proud of. And let me tell you something: this Tuesday, Mississippi can send a message to the entire nation. We can let the liberal Democrats with their socialist agenda know it may be alive and well in the heart of Nancy Pelosi, but it is dead in Mississippi.
Cindy H-S: (58:14)
We can let them know we don’t want open, illegal borders for drug smugglers to come through them. We can let them know that to kill an unborn baby is not a human right. It is a human life. This is a great crowd tonight. Next Tuesday, let’s go out and vote. Let’s support our governor, Tate Reeves. Let’s support these Mississippi Republican candidates. Go out and vote and let’s show the president how much we appreciate him, right now.
Donald Trump: (59:08)
Great job. Fantastic woman. So also with us, two terrific friends of mine that, like Roger and like Cindy Hyde-Smith, and like all of them … And Tate, he’s going to be right there. He’ll be right up there with us, all fighting together. Two incredible people: Trent Kelly, Michael Guest. Incredible people. And your next Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann. Your next Attorney General, Lynn Fitch. Your next Secretary of State, Michael Watson. Great people. Your next State Treasure, David McRae. State Auditor, Shad White. Agriculture Commissioner, Andy Gipson. Insurance Commissioner, Mike Chaney. And former governor, a man that nobody’s ever heard of in this room, I’m sure, but the truth is he’s a legend in politics and a great guy. He’s a great guy, Haley Barbour.
Donald Trump: (01:00:53)
Thank you, Haley. Great guy. So with the help of everyone here, we’re the hottest economy in the world, we’ve created over 6.7 million new jobs since the election. If I would have said during the campaign that I would create 6.7 million new jobs since the election, these people would have gone crazy. They would have said horrible things. They would have said it’s impossible. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over 51 years, soon to be historic. African-American unemployment just dropped to the lowest rate ever recorded; historic. Really unimportant to me, the African-American youth unemployment rate is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our country. We lifted 55,000 Mississippi residents out of poverty, 55,000. Hourly earnings [inaudible 01:02:03] …
Donald Trump: (01:02:03)
Hourly earnings are up 9% in Mississippi since the election. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories in our country. Under my administration, we’ve already added nearly 10,000 new factories, and many more are coming in as we speak. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts on average $2,000 to $2,500 per family, bringing almost $1 trillion back home to our shores. What’s happening? You couldn’t get the money. The big companies, they couldn’t get their money back both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint. They brought back almost $1 trillion now because of us. All put to work.
Donald Trump: (01:03:04)
We slashed the largest number in history of job-killing regulations, and we ended the war on American energy. We are now the number one producer of energy by far anywhere in the world.
Donald Trump: (01:03:29)
For decades, you saw corrupt politicians take money from lobbyists to impose catastrophic trade deals. Mississippi lost 40% of all manufacturing jobs after the twin disasters of NAFTA and China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization. Two of the worst deals ever made by our country. 100,000 Mississippi jobs were wiped away just like that, and that’s awful, and a big price to pay for Washington’s disloyalty to the American worker. That’s what it was. It was disloyalty, stupidity, corruption, lots of reasons. But now you finally have a President who is loyal to you, and I am.
Donald Trump: (01:04:25)
I’m a fighter for your jobs, for your wages, your factories, your families, and your dignity. We’re stopping China from ripping us off. We’re stopping all of these other countries from taking advantage of the United States where we lose our money, we lose our wealth, we lose our jobs, we close our factories. That’s not happening anymore. It’s reversed. We were the sucker country for years and years, but we are not the sucker country anymore, and they all know it.
Donald Trump: (01:05:06)
We’re replacing NAFTA … and that was a disaster, NAFTA … with the brand new US, Mexico, Canada agreement if Nancy Pelosi will ever put it up to a vote, which is questionable. Nervous Nancy, she doesn’t want to give the people of our country a victory. She’s very busy doing other things. Having fun. The USMCA will be a massive victory for Mississippi’s farmers and also includes powerful protections for Mississippi auto workers, manufacturers, and everybody else. It’s a great agreement. About time we got rid of NAFTA. The do-nothing Democrats need to stop their madness and pass the USMCA right now.
Donald Trump: (01:05:56)
The last administration’s horrendous Trans-Pacific Partnership would have destroyed the US auto industry, but I proudly, first thing, withdrew from that job-killing calamity. Under our policies, Toyota has just announced a $170 million investment in Mississippi and 400 new jobs at its facility … did you ever hear of this place … Blue Springs. Blue Springs.
Donald Trump: (01:06:37)
Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects all over the world. We take care of other people. We take care of other countries, but we don’t take care of our own. They knowingly decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. They deployed our military to protect … think of this … immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. I ask those wealthy nations now, I respectfully the other day said to the King of Saudi Arabia, “King, we’re going to help you, but you’ve got to pay.”
Donald Trump: (01:07:21)
And he was great. No, he was great. He was great. He said, “But nobody has ever asked before.” I said, “But I’m asking.” And billions of dollars will come in, and we’re protecting a great ally. We have a country that spends billions and billions of dollars in our country buying military and other things. But we said, “You’re very wealthy. You have to pay,” and they’re going to pay. And that’s true with many countries by the way. That’s true with many countries. They never respected us. They could never believe it. I said to one country … I have great respect for the Prime Minister of Japan. I said to Prime Minister, I said, “How did you get away with this for so long?” And he looked at me and he couldn’t really answer it because how the hell did this happen? We’re protecting 94 countries. Ask China, “How many countries are you protecting President Xi?” And they look at me like, “What a stupid question. We protect one. China.” You ask President Putin, “How many countries are you protecting President Putin?” And he looks and he goes, “Russia.” You ask other countries … we’re protecting at least 94. In fact, so many they can’t even tell me. I’ve been trying to get an answer for four months. So many they can’t even tell. It’s crazy, but it’s all beautiful the way it’s happening. A lot of good things are happening.
Donald Trump: (01:09:01)
But these same politicians poured precious American blood and treasure into the sands of the Middle East while allowing our cities to fall into disrepair and decay. Our failed ruling class believed it was their right to rule over you, to take your money, to take your jobs, to redistribute your wealth all over the globe, wherever they wanted it. But I don’t like that. I don’t like that. The great sellout has ended, and it ended the day I took the oath of office. That was quite a day.
Donald Trump: (01:09:44)
After years of building up foreign nations, we are finally building up our nation. We are finally putting America first. Our policy of never-ending war, regime change and nation-building is being replaced by the clear-eyed pursuit of American interests.
Speaker 3: (01:10:13)
There you go.
Donald Trump: (01:10:13)
It is the job of our military to protect our security, not to be the policemen of the world. Proving the wisdom of this approach, we recently secured a permanent ceasefire in Northern Syria without spilling one drop of American blood. Not one drop. Actually, I have to be honest. One soldier stepped on a nail. That’s true. I said, “Don’t tell the press that because they’ll say, but one soldier stepped in a nail.” I said, “How bad was it?” “It’s okay.” I said, “Don’t mention it please.” They always like to mention exactly what happened. You can take it a little bit low key. Stepped on a nail.
Speaker 3: (01:11:04)
Go Donald.
Donald Trump: (01:11:07)
Not a drop of blood. And we don’t have to defend the borders between Turkey and Syria. They’ve been fighting for 1000 years. But what we do is we did keep the oil, if you don’t mind. We kept the oil. We kept the oil. And we’ll distribute that oil, we’ll help out the Kurds, and we’ll help out other people. We’ll also help out ourselves if that’s okay.
Donald Trump: (01:11:34)
Past leaders, foolish military adventures turned far away nations into very, very dangerous war zones. Then they demanded that American citizens accept unlimited migration from those terror-afflicted nations and regions. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. We did not fight them over there only to invite them over here. We don’t want to do that.
Donald Trump: (01:12:07)
To protect our communities, my administration restricted migration from terror-prone nations and implemented the toughest ever vetting procedures. Toughest ever that we’ve ever had. No issue has ever been so horribly discarded by a party as that issue by the Democrats. They want open borders, which mean crime. They want sanctuary cities, which means crime and drugs and death. After bleeding the middle class dry, Democrats threw open our borders to the world, flooding our communities with poisonous drugs and criminal cartels. Republicans believe in strong borders and safe communities. We are now building a wall.
Speaker 4: (01:13:01)
Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall.
Donald Trump: (01:13:12)
We’re building it.
Speaker 4: (01:13:13)
Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall. Build that wall.
Donald Trump: (01:13:19)
We’re building it. And you think that was easy? The Democrats, they didn’t want that wall. I got money for everything, but when it came to the wall, not 25 cents. Not 25 cents. But we gave the military a lot of money and we took it from the military and we took it from here, we took it from there. Or we had to go to court and all of a sudden we start winning cases. We’re winning cases now. Winning a lot of cases.
Donald Trump: (01:13:46)
But the wall is going up rapidly. It’s going up rapidly. And this is a very serious wall. This is the exact everything they wanted. I went to the border patrol, incredible people and ICE. Incredible people, tough people. They love our country. And I said, “Give me the specifications for the wall.” They said, “Well sir, we’d like steel, but would also like concrete and would also like rebar.” I said, “Well, what do you want? Which one?” So I did all three because it’s a different form of cutting. You can cut through steel, but you can’t through the concrete and then you can’t through the hardened rebar. We got it all. “And we also need see-through, sir. Got to see who’s on the other side.” That makes sense, right? Not just concrete. It’s more expensive what we’re doing, but we’re giving and we’re building … we should have anywhere from 400 to almost 500 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It’s going up fast.
Donald Trump: (01:14:44)
In all the right areas. In all the right areas. That was a tough one. And the Army Corps of Engineers is building their hearts out. They’re great. Great people. We believe in keeping terrorists and criminals and drug dealers the hell out of our country. And thanks to our tireless efforts on the Southern Border, tough place, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May, and we are faster than ever securing the Southern Border. And soon it will be, when the wall is completed, secure like it’s never been before. And I want to thank the country of Mexico. They right now have 27,000 soldiers on our borders. 27,000. You know what that is? And they are keeping people out. And I want to thank the President of Mexico. He’s an excellent person, great man. And we appreciate it.
Donald Trump: (01:16:01)
And the reason is that our Democrats won’t even approve things called loopholes. They’re loopholes. That’s a horrible name, right? That means it’s a loophole. That means you can come in illegally and lots of things. Catch and release. You catch them. Then you’ve got to release them. By law you’ve got to release them or they’ll arrest the border patrol agent if they don’t release. It’s crazy. But we could end this in 15 minutes, but they don’t want to do it. They don’t want to do it. They’re obstructionists. They’re colluders. And we can’t let it happen. That’s why you have to go with Tate Reeves. Tate’s going to send a big signal, by the way. It’s a big signal. It’s great for you. He’s going to be a great governor. It also sends a big signal to these radical left, crazy Democrats. It’s very important that Tate wins. Very important.
Donald Trump: (01:16:55)
We’re also fighting deadly sanctuary cities with the help of states like Mississippi, which has banned sanctuary cities because Phil Bryant said, “We’re not going to have them,” and Roger Wicker said, “We’re not going to have them. And Cindy said, “We’re not going to have them.” Democrats’ sanctuary cities forced the release of dangerous criminal aliens onto our streets. If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE … and they are heroes, I wouldn’t want their job. MS-13, they walk right into those nests … they call them a nest … and they start swinging. You never saw anything like it. I’ll say, “You know what? Better you than me.” Let’s see who would do good. He’d do good. That guy. That guy would do good. Most of you wouldn’t do too good. No. I mean, these guys are tough guys and they love our country. Who would do it? They’re moving thousands of people from MS-13.
Donald Trump: (01:17:50)
These gangs are the worst people. These people, these are not human beings. You know, I said that once before and this crazy Nancy Pelosi said, “How dare you say they’re not human?” You ever see these people? And they slice people up with a knife because it’s more painful than using a gun. And then I have to defend myself when I say they’re animals. But you know what? I never changed. I didn’t say, “Oh, I’d like to apologize. I’d like to apologize. Crazy Nancy.”
Donald Trump: (01:18:20)
And you got to look at her district in San Francisco. She’s spending all her time on this crap or this impeachment stuff. Take a look at what’s happening to the great city, once, of San Francisco. It’s thousands and thousands of tents and drugs and needles and everything you can imagine floating in the streets in the best neighborhoods. Nancy Pelosi, go home and fix your district, Nancy. Go home and fix your district. Go home and fix your district.
Donald Trump: (01:18:58)
If you want a governor who will stand proudly with the heroes of ICE and border patrol, vote for Tate Reeves. Tuesday. Got to get out. You got to get out. Got to send the signal. Let it be a big victory too.
Donald Trump: (01:19:13)
The Democrat party has never been more extreme, you know that, than it is today. The Democrat healthcare agenda would obliterate Medicare. I will always protect Medicare for our seniors, and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. Always. We’ll always take care of them.
Donald Trump: (01:19:37)
Virtually every Democrat also now supports late-term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother’s womb right up until the moment of birth. Well, the governor of Virginia executed a baby. Remember that whole thing. After birth, after birth. Some people never heard of it. He said the baby is born and then he starts talking to the mother. Nobody ever heard that. That is why I’ve asked Congress to prohibit extreme late-term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God.
Donald Trump: (01:20:22)
Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream. Nobody has done more for the African American community than the Republican party. And we’re also the party of Abraham Lincoln. We can’t forget that. People forget. Abraham Lincoln. Honest Abe.
Donald Trump: (01:21:08)
To lift up distressed communities, we created opportunities zones. So incredible. So successful. Including 100 new opportunity zones right now in Mississippi where money is now flowing in to build and to fix. And Tim Scott, I give him so much credit from the great state of South Carolina.
Donald Trump: (01:21:34)
We pass VA Choice and VA Accountability on behalf of our great veterans. People said it couldn’t be done. VA Choice. Our veterans were waiting on line for days and weeks sometimes. Now they can go out, [inaudible 01:21:48] choices. They can go out, get a doctor, we pay the bill, and they don’t have to wait six weeks, four weeks, two weeks. We had people waiting in line. They weren’t very sick. By the time they saw the doctor, they were terminally ill. Now they go on and they go and they go outside and they find a doctor and we take care of our great veterans.
Donald Trump: (01:22:21)
The great rebuilding of the American Armed Forces has included massive investments in the military and facilities in Biloxi and Gulfport and Jackson and Starkville. And Roger has been fantastic. And Cindy Hyde-Smith has been fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:22:46)
To protect America’s security, I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal. It’s not the same country anymore. Nothing’s easy, but it’s not the same. And I recognized Israel’s true capital and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
Donald Trump: (01:23:10)
For years you watch as your politicians apologize for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Mississippi. The next step to victory begins on Tuesday right here in your great state. With your support we will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not ever going to back down from perhaps the greatest victory in political history.
Donald Trump: (01:23:48)
And you know today with the new stock market at an all-time high, it’s … I will tell you something … if we didn’t win this election, that stock market would be in one-half. It was heading in the wrong direction. It was going to fail. And if they ever did anything bad, if they ever do anything bad to us, if they ever succeed in their wildest dream, which will never let them happen, that stock market will crash like you’ve never seen a crash before. And you will not be happy with your 401ks like you’re happy right now because they don’t know what they’re doing. They don’t know what they’re doing.
Donald Trump: (01:24:33)
And I’d like to speak well, but the leadership, they have no clue. They’re just very vicious people. Actually, they’re sort of mentally violent people, but we’ve got it under control. It always helps when you didn’t do anything wrong. I always say, “How do you impeach a President who didn’t do anything wrong?” So we’re going to send a signal by sending a terrific new Republican governor to Jackson. On Tuesday, you’re going to get out and you’re going to vote, and you’re going to give up whatever you have to give up. You’re going to leave work maybe a little early or maybe get there a little late. Tell your boss I said it was okay. I will give you a pardon if I have to. I’ll give you a one-hour pardon. But with your help, we will lift millions more of our great citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. And you have great congressmen here and I’ll tell you, I want to appreciate it, fellas. Warriors, you’re warriors. You are warriors. What was it? 196 for and nothing against, right? That doesn’t happen with Republicans. It doesn’t happen. I always complain. I always say the Democrats are lousy politicians. They have lousy policies. Open borders, sanctuary cities, but they have one thing. They stick together and they’re vicious. The Republicans have great policy. In many ways they’re better politicians, but they’re not as vicious.
Speaker 5: (01:26:33)
[inaudible 00:24:38].
Donald Trump: (01:26:33)
Thank you, darling. I appreciate it. They’re not as vicious, but they have a tendency to split apart. The Democrats don’t seem to have any Mitt Romneys. We do. We do. I don’t know. Maybe he’ll get better. Maybe he’ll get better. We’ll see. We’ll see what happens. Maybe he’ll get better. Just let it be fair, but they don’t have that.
Donald Trump: (01:26:59)
We will enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful, beautiful words, ‘Made in the USA.’ Made in America. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. Can you believe that? Within 10 years it will be over. When they told me that, I said, “That’s incredible.” We’re going to end the AIDS epidemic within 10 years. It’s funded. Nobody would have thought we could do that, but we’re doing it. We’ll have it ended in America in 10 years. The AIDS epidemic. Who would’ve thought?
Donald Trump: (01:27:45)
We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way.
Donald Trump: (01:28:33)
We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto and we always will. You’ll never see it disappear. In God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American Patriots who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industry, pioneered technology, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And today it’s greater than ever before.
Donald Trump: (01:29:44)
Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. That’s what we’re doing. That’s what happened in 2016. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We’ll get so tired of winning. I don’t know, Mississippi. You’re winning. You had the best year you’ve ever had. You have the best, Mississippi, the best year you’ve ever had in the history of our country. Mississippi. Your statistic. Mississippi, aren’t you getting tired of winning?
Speaker 4: (01:30:41)
No.
Donald Trump: (01:30:45)
I guess not. So Phil doesn’t come to me and say, “Sir, please, we’re willing too much. The people of Mississippi can’t take it anymore.” I don’t think you’ll ever have to make that trip. I don’t think he’s ever going to have to, and I don’t think Tate will ever have to make that trip. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God.
Donald Trump: (01:31:14)
America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Mississippi, the best is yet to come. Because together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again.
Donald Trump: (01:31:50)
Thank you, Mississippi. Thank you."
"Oct 23, 2019",3:32 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
Well, thank you very much. My fellow Americans I greet you this morning from the White House to announce a major breakthrough toward achieving a better future for Syria and for the Middle East, it’s been a long time. Over the last five days, you have seen that a ceasefire that we established along Syria’s border has held and it’s held very well beyond most expectations. Early this morning, the government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria and making the ceasefire permanent and it will indeed be permanent.
Donald Trump: (00:43)
However, you would also define the word permanent in that part of the world as somewhat questionable, we all understand that, but I do believe it will be permanent. I’ve therefore instructed the secretary of the treasury to lift all sanctions imposed on October 14th in response to Turkey’s original offensive moves against the Kurds in Syria’s Northeast border region. So the sanctions will be lifted unless something happens that we’re not happy with. This was an outcome created by us, the United States and nobody else, no other nation, very simple.
Donald Trump: (01:25)
And we’re willing to take blame and we’re also willing to take credit. This is something they’ve been trying to do for many decades. Since then, others have come out to help and we welcome them to do so. Other countries have stepped forward, they want to help and we think that’s great. The nations and the region must ultimately take on the responsibility of helping Turkey and Syria police their border. We want other nations to get involved. We’ve secured the oil and therefore a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil. And we’re going to be protecting it and we’ll be deciding what we’re going to do with it in the future.
Donald Trump: (02:08)
In any event, by the moves that we’ve made, we’re achieving a much more peaceful and stable area between Turkey and Syria, including a 20 mile wide safe zone, an interesting term, safe zone. That’s the term we’re using. Hopefully that zone will become safe. Thousands and thousands of people have been killed in that zone over the years that has been sought for many decades and I think we have something that’s going to be strong and hold up. Turkey, Syria and all forms of the Kurds had been fighting for centuries. We have done them a great service and we’ve done a great job for all of them and now we’re getting out, long time.
Donald Trump: (02:59)
We were supposed to be there for 30 days, that was almost 10 years ago. So we’re there for 30 days and now we’re leaving. We’re supposed to be a very quick hit and let’s get out and it was a quick hit except they stayed for almost 10 years. Let someone else fight over this long bloodstained sand. I want to thank vice president Pence and secretary of state Pompeo for leading the American delegation so successfully to Turkey several days ago along with national security advisor O’Brien. I want to thank them very much.
Donald Trump: (03:43)
The American delegation negotiated the original five-day ceasefire that ended Kurdish fighters to safely leave. It just got them to a point where frankly it enabled them to get out to go and move really just a few miles in a slightly different direction. So this enabled them to do so. Countless lives are now being saved as a result of our negotiation with Turkey, an outcome reached without spilling one drop of American blood. No injuries, nobody shot, nobody killed.
Donald Trump: (04:25)
I have just spoken to General Mazloum, a wonderful man, the commander in chief of the SDF Kurds and he was extremely thankful for what the United States has done, could not have been more thankful. General Mazloum has assured me that ISIS is under very strict lock and key and the detention facilities are being strongly maintained. There were a few that got out, a small number, relatively speaking and they’d been largely recaptured.
Donald Trump: (05:04)
I’m also sure that he will be issuing his own statement very shortly. We had a great talk, but we’ve saved the lives of many Kurds, he understands that. The war was going to be vicious and probably not very long and I’m very happy to have been involved in it as are our vice president, our secretary of state and all of the other people in our team. By getting that ceasefire to stick, we’ve done something that’s very special. But by getting the ceasefire after a tremendous amount of really tough war for a very short period of days, that is something very special.
Donald Trump: (05:57)
Our troops are safe and the pain and suffering of the three day fight that occurred was directly responsible for our ability to make an agreement with Turkey and the Kurds that could never have been made without this short term outburst. Should Turkey fail to honor its obligations including the protection of religious and ethnic minorities, which I truly believe they will do, we reserve the right to reimpose crippling sanctions, including substantially increased tariffs on steel and all other products coming out of Turkey.
Donald Trump: (06:33)
We are now an economic powerhouse like never before and very importantly like no other. Our economic might is stronger than it’s ever been and our competitors are not doing very well. We also expect Turkey to abide by its commitment regarding ISIS as a backup to the Kurds watching over them should something happen, Turkey is there to grab them. Further, we implore European countries to come and take those fighters that the US captured and bring them back to their countries for incarceration and for trial.
Donald Trump: (07:16)
Until just recently, Europe has been very unresponsive in doing what they should have been doing for a long time. Now is their chance to finally act. American forces defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate during the last two years. We thank the Syrian Democratic Forces for their sacrifices in this effort, they’ve been terrific. Now Turkey, Syria, and others in the region must work to ensure that ISIS does not regain any territory. It’s their neighborhood. They have to maintain it, they have to take care of it.
Donald Trump: (08:01)
There were some political pundants who responded to Turkey’s offensive in Syria by calling for yet another American military intervention. I don’t think so. But halting the incursion by military force would have required deploying tens of thousands of American troops against Turkey, a NATO ally and a country the United States has developed a very good relationship with, including President Erdogan. The same people that I watched and read giving me in the United States advice were the people that I have been watching and reading for many years, they are the ones that got us into the Middle East mess but never had the vision or the courage to get us out.
Donald Trump: (08:56)
They just talk. How many Americans must die in the middle East, in the midst of these ancient sectarian and tribal conflicts? After all of the precious blood and treasure America has poured into the deserts of the Middle East, I am committed to pursuing a different course, one that leads to victory for America. Through much work, we have done things that everybody said couldn’t be done. Today’s announcement validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago was scorned and now people are saying, “What a great outcome. Congratulations.”
Donald Trump: (09:50)
It’s too early to me to be congratulated, but we’ve done a good job. We’ve saved a lot of lives. Most importantly, we have avoided another costly military intervention that could have led to disastrous, far reaching consequences. Many thousands of people could’ve been killed. The last administration said, “Assad must go.” They could have easily produced that outcome, but they didn’t. In fact, they drew a very powerful red line in the sand.
Donald Trump: (10:22)
You all remember the red line in the sand when children were gassed and killed, but then did not honor their commitment as other children died in the same horrible manner. But I did honor my commitments with 58 Tomahawks, eight long years after President Obama’s ill-fated push at regime change, US troops are still on the ground in Syria. More than half a million people are dead. Hundreds of thousands are terribly injured and millions more Syrians are displaced.
Donald Trump: (11:06)
It really is a nightmare of misery. Across the Middle East we have seen anguish on a colossal scale. We have spent $8 trillion on wars in the Middle East, never really wanting to win those wars, but after all that money was spent and all of those lives lost, the young men and women gravely wounded, so many. The Middle East is less safe, less stable, and less secure than before these conflicts began.
Donald Trump: (11:45)
The same people pushing for these wars are often the ones demanding America open its doors to unlimited migration from war torn regions, importing the terrorism and the threat of terrorism right to our own shores. But not anymore. My administration understands that immigration security is national security. As a candidate for president, I made clear that we needed a new approach to American foreign policy.
Donald Trump: (12:21)
One guided not by ideology, but by experience, history and a realistic understanding of the world. We are building up America’s military might like never before, investing two and a half trillion dollars since my election, but we will not be depleted. We will not happen again. It will not be allowed to happen again. Where our military is depleted, fighting in areas of the world where we shouldn’t be. When we commit American troops to battle, we must do so only when a vital national interest is at stake. And when we have a clear objective, a plan for victory and a path out of conflict, that’s what we have to have.
Donald Trump: (13:18)
We need a plan of victory, we will only win. Our whole basis has to be the right plan and then we will only win, nobody can beat us. I want to again, thank everyone on the American team who helped achieve the ceasefire in Syria, saved so many lives along with President Erdogan of Turkey, a man I’ve gotten to know very well and a man who loves his country and in his mind he’s doing the right thing for his country and we may be meeting in the very near future.
Donald Trump: (13:58)
I also want to thank General Mazloum for his understanding and for his great strength and for his incredible words today to me, but me just as a representative of the United States. Because he knows that we saved tens of thousands of Kurds and we’re not talking in the long term. We’re talking in the short term, we’re talking something that was going on immediately and something frankly, that was planned for a long time. The job of our military is not to police the world. Other nations must step up and do their fair share that hasn’t taken place. Today’s breakthrough is a critical step in that direction. Thank you all very much, and God bless America. Thank you."
"Oct 4, 2019",4:58 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:01)
Unemployment numbers just came out, and they’re the best numbers we’ve had in over 50 years. The unemployment number is down to 3.5%, so that goes way, way back. We haven’t had numbers like this in a long time. Wages are up by almost 3%, that’s a fantastic increase for everybody out there working. We’re very happy about those numbers. The stock market is substantially up as it was yesterday, and our country does well. Europe is not doing well. Asia is doing poorly, to put it mildly. And we continue to do very well, we’re the miracle.
Donald Trump: (00:41)
But the unemployment numbers just came out, 3.5% unemployment, and that is a tremendous number, the lowest in over 50 years. So, very happy. And I think really very important, again, I’ll say, wages are up. When I was running, wages were nowhere. They were going down and people were having doing three jobs, and they were making less money than they made 20 years before. Now wages are up, so we’re very happy about that.
Donald Trump: (01:08)
One other thing having to do with Poland. So Poland is a country, great people. We have a lot of Polish Americans living in the United States. I’ve just signed, I will soon be signing, and signed certain preliminary applications, we will be giving a full visa waiver to Poland. That means that people from Poland can easily travel there, and people from here can easily go back and forth. They can each, people from the U.S., people from Poland can very easily go back and forth between the United States in Poland. So they’ve been trying to get this for many, many decades, and I got it for the Polish people in honor of the Polish people in the United States and in Poland. So we’re very happy with that. Yeah?
Reporters: (01:58)
Did you see Adam Schiff got four Pinocchios by the Post this morning for lying?
Donald Trump: (02:02)
Well, I heard Adam Schiff got four Pinocchios. That’s good. He should’ve gotten them two and a half years ago. That’s a very nice question, let me shake your hand. Come here. That’s a very nice question. Almost a surprise, I figured that was a trick question.
Reporters: (02:18)
Also, what does your letter to Pelosi say? And when will you send it?
Donald Trump: (02:22)
Well, we’ll be issuing a letter. As everybody knows, we’ve been treated very unfairly, very different from anybody else. If you go over, not only history, I mean, you go over any aspect of life, you’ll see how unfairly we’ve been treated. We’ve done a fantastic job. Everything to me is about corruption. We want to find out what happened with 2016, and as you know, there’s a lot of work going on on that. I don’t care about Biden’s campaign, but I do care about corruption. His campaign, that’s up to him. Politics, that’s up to them. I don’t care about politics. Politics, as I think I made clear, and yesterday somebody asked me a question, and I gave an answer, but always in the form of corruption, what I want to do, and I think I have an obligation to do it, probably a duty to do it, corruption. We are looking for corruption.
Donald Trump: (03:13)
When you look at what Biden and his son did, and when you look at other people, what they’ve done, and I believe there was tremendous corruption with Biden, but I think there was beyond, I mean beyond corruption having to do with the 2016 campaign and what these lowlifes did to so many people to hurt so many people in the Trump campaign, which was successful despite all of the fighting us. I mean, despite all of the unfairness. So we are looking at corruption. We’re not looking at politics, we’re looking at corruption.
Reporters: (03:47)
What did you say to the Chinese about the Bidens, sir? What did you say to the Chinese about the Bidens, sir?
Donald Trump: (03:51)
I don’t know. Somebody said that a long time ago … was that in 2017? I don’t know, you’d have to tell me when. All I can tell you this, when I speak to foreign leaders, I speak in an appropriate way. If you notice, they don’t mention the call that I had with the President of Ukraine. They don’t mention that because it was so good. The only time they mentioned it was when Adam Schiff made it up. You talk about Pinocchios, that should get 10 Pinocchios. He made up a story, it was a phony story, Adam Schiff. So they don’t talk about that anymore.
Donald Trump: (04:29)
You know when this came out, it was quid pro quo. Well there was none. Also yesterday, the Ambassador, who I heard was tremendous, and a tremendous person, he was 100% for what we’re saying, 100%. And if you look, he also said there was no quid pro quo. That’s the whole ball game. But now the Democrats don’t bring that up anymore because they lied. Look, they never thought I was going to release the phone call between the Ukrainian President and myself. When I released that call, they were jumping around like you wouldn’t believe. They didn’t know how to respond. And then they found out that the call itself was so bad for them. It was a perfect call. There was nothing. We hand that out. We’ve handed the call out to people, and they say, “Wow, this is incredible.” We’re very proud of that call. When I speak to a foreign leader, I speak in an inappropriate manner.
Donald Trump: (05:31)
Now, we’re also doing trade deals with China, and we’re doing deals with a lot of people for the country. So I’m not looking to insult people, I can tell you that, but we could probably find that out-
Reporters: (05:42)
Would you be more willing to do a trade deal with the Chinese if they investigate Biden?
Donald Trump: (05:45)
No, it has nothing to do with it. No. No, I want to do a trade deal with China, but only if it’s good for our country, and it could happen. As you know, they’re very much coming over, next week, as I understand it. So I’d like to do a trade deal with China, but only if it’s a great trade deal for this country. One thing has nothing to do with the other.
Reporters: (06:09)
Do you want the House to proceed with an impeachment inquiry at this point, an official impeachment inquiry?
Donald Trump: (06:12)
Well, I wouldn’t mind because we have no rights. The way they’re doing it, they’ve taken away our rights. So if they proceed, and you know, they’ll just get their people, they’re all in line, because even though many of them don’t want to vote, they have no choice. They have to follow their leadership. And then we’ll get it to this Senate, then we’re going to win. The Republicans have been very unified.
Donald Trump: (06:33)
This is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country. So we beat the one that started immediately. We went through two years of Mueller, and that came out like at 10, it came out perfect. And a few days go by, and they start this nonsense, and this is just as ridiculous. So the Democrats, unfortunately, they have the votes. They could vote very easily, even though most of them, many of them don’t believe they should do it. And I do believe, I do believe that because of what they’re doing, with Pelosi and they’re real leaders, AOC plus three, that’s their real leaders, I really believe that they’re going to pay a tremendous price at the polls.
Donald Trump: (07:17)
And we saw the first glimpse of it two weeks ago in a great state, North Carolina. We saw a great, great glimpse of what’s going to happen, because in North Carolina we had two races. One gentleman, Dan Bishop, was down by 17 points with three weeks to go, and he won easily. And the other man, as you know, Greg Murphy, was up by a very little bit, and he won by a massive amount. I don’t know, some place in the 20s, 20% or something, maybe higher. So I think you got your first glimpse of what’s going to happen. And the big key is that I have to campaign there. But if you look at what happened in North Carolina, two races, we won both of them, and we won them easily, and one was almost tied, and the other one was a big, big lead, and that one turned, and the tie became a land side.
Reporters: (08:09)
Mr. President? [inaudible 00:08:10] the Senate?
Donald Trump: (08:23)
Well, I don’t know about Mitch. I have a lot of respect for Mitch McConnell. I know that I saw his statements, and he thinks that this is ridiculous, he thinks it’s unfair. I saw his statement yesterday that he put out where he read my phone conversation, and he thought it was a wonderful conversation. And it was. But see, the Democrats don’t talk about that anymore. They try and go to other things. These people are looking for anything they can get because they know they’re going to lose the election, and we’re in election season now. For them be doing this now, it’s never been done.
Reporters: (09:04)
Mr. President?
Donald Trump: (09:05)
What?
Reporters: (09:06)
U.S. is talking with North Korea in Sweden right now. What do you expect?
Donald Trump: (09:07)
So we’re dealing with North Korea. They want to meet, and we’ll be meeting with them. It’s probably being set up as we speak, but we’ll let you know. But North Korea would like to do something, Iran would like to do something. We have a lot of countries in a very good position right now, despite the witch hunt, which hurts our country and it hurts in America. But Iran wants to do something, North Korea wants to do something, and China would like to do something.
Reporters: (09:34)
Mr. President, is the Justice Department investigating Joe Biden?
Donald Trump: (09:40)
I don’t know, that you’d have to ask … Is the Justice Department investigating Joe Biden?
Reporters: (09:46)
Yeah.
Donald Trump: (09:46)
Well, that you’d have to ask Attorney General Barr, but I can tell you just as an observer, what I saw Biden do with his son, he is pillaging these countries, and he’s hurting us. How would you like to have, as an example, Joe Biden negotiating the China deal. If he took it over from me after the election, he would give them … wait … he would give them everything. He would give them everything. How would you like to have that? Joe Biden would just roll out the red carpet, he’d give them everything.
Donald Trump: (10:20)
So again, this doesn’t pertain to anything but corruption. And that has to do with me. I don’t care about politics, I don’t care about anything, but I do care about corruption. And to have somebody take out a billion-and-a-half dollars out of China, who is totally unfit, he’s unfit, to have him get a billion-and-a-half dollars, to have him, and now I’m hearing the number of 50,000 a month, now I’m hearing the number of $50,000 a month is very low, it’s a much higher number that Biden’s son was getting per month. In fact, it’s much higher. And for him as a totally unqualified person to be getting hundreds of thousands a month is very, very sad.
Donald Trump: (11:11)
So again, is the Justice Department investigating that? I just don’t know.
Reporters: (11:16)
Mr. President, do you think the Democrats have the votes?
Donald Trump: (11:22)
Well, I think they follow the leader. One thing with the Democrats, I give them credit for it, a lot of them don’t want it. You know that, you interview them. A lot of them are in, they call them Trump districts, where I won, and then they won after when I was in running. But I’m going to win them big. If you look at what’s happened with my polls, they’re through the roof. You know why? Because of this phony witch hunt. If you look at what happened with the fundraising, we’ve set a record, the Republicans, because people are sick and tired of it.
Donald Trump: (11:51)
I got a call the other night from pastors, the biggest pastors, Evangelical Christians. They said, “We have never seen our religion or any religion so electrified.” They say they’ve never seen anything like it. Churches are joining, hundreds of thousands of people. And you know, that’s to a large extent because of you, and your partner, the Democrats.
Reporters: (12:15)
Do you think it’ll pass in the House, sir? Do you think it’ll pass the House and die in the Senate?
Donald Trump: (12:19)
Well, I think this, I think this. We have a great relationship in the Senate. I have a 95% approval rating of the Republican Party. I believe the Senate, and I haven’t spoken to that many senators, but I believe the Senators look at this as a hoax. It’s a witch hunt. It’s a disgrace. Should have never happened. Just like Russia collusion delusion should have never happened, that was a witch hunt. And just like that, should have never happened. So I think of the Senate, I think they feel that the Republican Party has been treated very, very badly. Now in the House, they have the majority, they all vote with AOC plus three. Nancy Pelosi’s petrified of them. I mean, she’s afraid she’s going to lose her position. Nancy Pelosi will lose her speakership right after the election, when the Republicans take over the House.
Reporters: (13:16)
Mr. President, sir, can we talk about the text messages, that included holding off a visit to the White House?
Donald Trump: (13:22)
The one text message that I saw was just about the last text message, because I don’t even know most of these ambassadors. I didn’t even know their names. But the text message that I saw from Ambassador Sondland, who’s highly respected, was there’s no quid pro quo. He said that. He said, “By the way,” it almost sounded like in general, he said, “By the way, there’s no quid pro quo.” And there isn’t. Now, for Biden. There would be. But listen to this, there is no pro quo. And that was the text message that I saw, and that nullified everything.
Reporters: (14:01)
What other leaders have you looked up?
Reporters: (14:03)
Have you asked foreign leaders for any corruption investigation that don’t involve your political opponents? That is, are there other cases where you’ve asked for corruption investigations-
Donald Trump: (14:10)
We would have to look, but I tell you, what I asked for, and what I always will ask for, is anything having to do with corruption, with respect to our country. If a foreign country can help us with respect to corruption, and corruption probes, and I don’t care if it’s Biden or anybody else, but if they can help us, if Biden is corrupt, if his son is corrupt, when his son takes out billions of dollars, billions, and he has no experience, he just got fired from the Navy, when they do that, that’s no good. So the only, just to finish your question, anything having to do with corruption, I actually feel I have an obligation to do that.
Reporters: (14:53)
Including with Mr. Putin, sir? Including with Mr. Putin?
Reporters: (14:53)
Is anyone advising you that it is okay to solicit the help of other governments to investigate a potential political opponent?
Donald Trump: (15:03)
No, I don’t say anything is okay. I’ll tell you what’s okay.
Reporters: (15:06)
Is someone advising you, then?
Donald Trump: (15:06)
Here is what’s okay. If we feel there is corruption, like I feel that was in the 2016 campaign, there was tremendous corruption against me, if we feel there is corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country. And just so you know, just so you know-
Reporters: (15:23)
Including Mr. Putin, sir?
Donald Trump: (15:24)
I was investigated.
Reporters: (15:26)
Will you acknowledge Mr. Putin as well?
Donald Trump: (15:26)
I was investigated. Okay? Me. Me, in my campaign, I ran, I won, I was investigated. You won’t say that, will you? I was investigated, I was investigated, and they think it could have been by U.K. They think it could have been by Australia. They think it could have been by Italy. So when you get down to it, I was investigated by the Obama administration. By the Obama administration, I was investigated. So when these people talk … But as far as I’m concerned, what I want to look at and what we want to investigate, anything having to do with corruption.
Reporters: (16:07)
Excuse me, Mr. President. Do you view China [inaudible 00:16:17] adversary?
Donald Trump: (16:21)
I view China as somebody we’re trying to make a deal with, we have a very good chance of making a deal with. We’ve had good moments with China, we’ve had bad moments with China. Right now, we’re in a very important stage in terms of possibly making a deal. If we make it, it’ll be the biggest trade deal ever made, if we make it. But I view China as somebody that we deal with on the world’s stage. I would like to get along with China if we can, and if we can, that’s great. If we can’t, that’s okay too. But what we’re doing is we’re negotiating a very tough deal. If the deal is not going to be 100% for us, then we’re not going to make it.
Donald Trump: (17:02)
And I will say this, I will say this. I will say this, China very much wants to make this deal. China’s getting killed. The tariffs are killing China. What’s happened is they have now three million loss of jobs, their chains are broken up. If you look at their supply chain, it’s a disaster. Companies are going to other countries, including us. China right now is a total disaster.
Reporters: (17:34)
Mr. President, does the trade deal with China have anything to do with an investigation into Joe Biden?
Donald Trump: (17:38)
No, no, no, no. Let me tell you, I’m only interested in corruption. I don’t care about politics. I don’t care about Biden’s politics. I never thought Biden was going to win, to be honest. I picked somebody else a long time ago, and we’ll see what happens. But I never thought Biden was going to win, but I don’t care. I mean, frankly, if he won I’d be very happy. I think he’d be an easy opponent. But I never thought Biden was going to win. I don’t care about politics, but I do care about corruption. And this whole thing is about corruption. This whole thing, this whole thing is about corruption.
Reporters: (18:21)

Donald Trump: (18:27)
This is about corruption, and this is not about politics. This is about corruption. And if you look, and you read our Constitution and many other things, I have an obligation to look at corruption. I have an actual obligation and a duty.
Reporters: (18:50)
Are you going to comply with the House subpoenas?
Donald Trump: (18:50)
What?
Reporters: (18:55)
Are you going to cooperate with the House [inaudible 00:18:57]?
Donald Trump: (18:57)
I don’t know. That’s up to the lawyers. I know the lawyers think they’ve never seen anything so unfair. They’ve never seen anything so unjust. I’ve been president now for almost three years, and I’ve been going through this for almost three years. It’s almost become like a part of my day. But in the meantime, we have the best economy we’ve ever had. We have the best job numbers we’ve had in 51 years, the best unemployment numbers that we’ve had in a half a century. The best numbers that we’ve ever had. African Americans, Hispanic American, Asian American, women, everything, we have the best numbers that we’ve had in many, many, many decades. And you know what? People understand that. People are working, they’re making money. If you look at one very important number that was just announced, wages, up 3%. That’s unheard of. That’s unheard of. So it’s a great thing.
Reporters: (19:55)
[crosstalk 00:19:55].
Donald Trump: (20:04)
I didn’t hear you. Go, go.
Donald Trump: (20:12)
We’re investigating corruption. We’re not investigating campaigns. I don’t care about his campaign. As I said, I didn’t think and I don’t think Biden’s going to win. All right? I don’t think. And maybe to answer your question, when you say who is going to win, I’d rather not make a prediction, but I do have a feeling about somebody. But I didn’t think, because I’ve watched Biden over the years, and Biden is not the brightest person. I never thought he was going to win. I never felt he was going to win. If you look at his other two campaigns, he was a one percenter, he got very few votes. He got taken off of the garbage heap by Obama. Obama took him off the garbage heap, so it’s one of those things. But I never thought that Biden, I didn’t think Biden was going to win. I guess everybody has a shot, but I don’t think he would be, frankly, my toughest opponent either. And just to finish off, I don’t think that he will win. I didn’t think he was going to win, and I don’t think he is going to win.
Reporters: (21:27)
Pretty badly. Elizabeth Warren has, I think, 36. What do you think about facing Elizabeth Warren?
Donald Trump: (21:28)
It’s fine. I mean, it’s fine. She’s a socialist, and maybe worse than that. But we’ll see. I heard, I haven’t seen these poll numbers. I haven’t seen Biden’s poll numbers. Look, Joe Biden was never going to make it, all right? He was never going to make it. He tried it twice, he was at 1%. There’s a reason. When I announced, I went to number one day one, and I stayed there the entire primary season. I never was off center stage. I was never given credit for that, but that’s okay, except by Steve. The only ones that gave me credit was Steve.

No, they were trying to set up a meeting, but he wanted sanctions lifted, and I said, “You must be kidding.” We had no interest. Rouhani wanted a meeting at the UN. We did talk. I didn’t speak to him personally, but our sides talked, he wanted sanctions lifted or partially lifted, and I said no.

Now, one thing, I’m now going to Walter Reed Hospital. We’re going to be giving out five Purple Hearts to unbelievably brave young people. And I’m going to meet you, some of you are going over. I don’t know, I think some of you are going over, so we can talk further over there. Although when we’re there, I would like you to respect the process.

What?
Reporters: (02:01)
[crosstalk 00:02:12].
Donald Trump: (02:01)
Well, if you’re looking at the whistleblower’s complaint it’s totally inaccurate because the conversation that I had was absolutely perfect and most people that have read it say the same thing. The whistleblower never saw the conversation, he got his information, I guess, second or third hand he wrote something that was total fiction. And now when people see that they’re not happy.
Donald Trump: (02:46)
Well, we’re looking at a lot of different things. China’s coming in next week, we’re going to have a meeting with them. We’ll see. But we’re doing very well. Some of the numbers, I think, are being affected by all of the nonsense, all of the politics going on in this country by the Democrats. I call them the “do nothing’s;” they do nothing for this country. They don’t care about this country, but the numbers really are looking very good going into the future. So, we’ll see. I have a lot of options on China, but if they don’t do what we want, we have tremendous, tremendous power.
Reporters: (03:19)
[inaudible 00:03:19] What exactly did you hope Zelinsky would do about the [inaudible 00:03:26] phone call?
Donald Trump: (03:26)
Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, that sort of major investigation into the bias, it’s a very simple answer. They should investigate the Biden’s because how does a company that’s newly formed and all these companies did you look at … and by the way, likewise, China just started an investigation into the Biden’s because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with with Ukraine.
Donald Trump: (03:56)
So, I would say that president Zelinsky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Biden’s because nobody has any doubt that they weren’t crooked. That was a crooked deal. 100%. He had no knowledge of energy, didn’t know the first thing about it. All of a sudden he’s getting $50,000 a month plus a lot of other things. Nobody has any doubt. And they got rid of a prosecutor who was a very tough prosecutor. They got rid of them. Now they’re trying to make it the opposite way, but they got rie- So, if I were the president, I would certainly recommend that of Ukraine.
Donald Trump: (04:42)
I haven’t, but certainly something we can start thinking about because I’m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny where billions of dollars is taken out of his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy. He got kicked out of the Navy. All of the sudden he’s getting billions of dollars. You know what they call that? They call that a pay off.
Donald Trump: (05:18)
Well, I leave that to the lawyers. I can say though, that Schiff has now been proven to be a liar. We’ve known it for three years because they’ve been trying to impeach for three years. He’s a lie- He’s just stone cold liar. So, I leave that to the lawyers. That’s up to them to decide. But the whole investigation is crumbling. Yeah?
Reporters: (05:37)

Donald Trump: (05:40)
I can. Yeah, I can. I can.
Reporters: (05:43)
[crosstalk 00:05:43] How?
Donald Trump: (05:43)
I can.
Donald Trump: (05:55)
We have a real problem. We’ve been hitting the Taliban very, very hard. And as far as I’m concerned, they still haven’t recovered from killing 12 people, one who happened to be a great American soldier from Puerto Rico and they still have not recovered and they probably never will.
Donald Trump: (06:20)
No. But I read Mitch McConnell’s statement yesterday and he read my phone call and as you know, he put out his statement that said that was the most innocent phone call he’s read. And I spoke to him about it, too. He read my phone call with the President of Ukraine, Mitch McConnell. He said that was the most innocent phone call that I’ve read. I mean, give me a break. Anybody that reads it says the same thing. And the only people that don’t understand it is when they look at the false, fabricated, fraudulent statement made by shifty Schiffs.
Donald Trump: (07:03)
Well, I think Biden is going down and I think his whole situation, because now you may very well find that there are many other countries that they scammed, just like they scammed China and Ukraine and basically who are they really scamming? The USA and it’s not good.
Reporters: (07:20)

And that’s probably why China has such a sweetheart deal that for so many years they’ve been ripping off our guns.
Donald Trump: (07:51)
We’re looking at it. We’re looking at it very closely. It’s under study.

"Oct 2, 2019",2:38 P.M.  EDT,"Morning Press Conference Transcript
Sauli Niinisto: (00:00)
Thank you very much. I am waiting for our discussions.
Donald Trump: (00:04)
Yes, yes. See, he’s a man of few words and he gets it done.. That’s what I like about him anyway, okay, thank you all very much.
Speaker 3: (00:14)
President Trump, how are you responding against charges that you are putting the whistleblower’s life in danger?
Donald Trump: (00:19)
Well, the whistleblower was very inaccurate. The whistleblower started this whole thing by writing a report on the conversation I had with the president of Ukraine. And the conversation was perfect. It couldn’t have been nicer. I saw a Rick Scott. I saw many of the Senators talking about it. Many of the congressmen talking about it. Not a thing wrong. Unless you heard the Adam Schiff version where he made up my conversation. He actually made it up.
Donald Trump: (00:44)
It should be criminal. It should be treasonous. He made it up. Every word of it, made up and read to Congress as though I said it, and I’ll tell you what, he should be forced to resign from Congress. Adam Schiff. He’s a lowlife. He should be forced to resign. He took a perfect conversation, realized he couldn’t read it to Congress because it was perfect. It was a very nice conversation. I knew many people were on the phone. Not only were many people on the phone, we had stenographers on the phone taking it down word for word.
Donald Trump: (01:15)
He took that conversation, which was perfect. He said, “I can’t read this.” So he made up a conversation and he reported it and said it to Congress and to the American people. And it was horrible what he said. And that was supposed to be coming from me, but it was all fabricated. He should resign from office in disgrace. And frankly they should look at him for treason because he is making up the words of the President of the United States. Not only words, but the meaning. And it’s a disgrace. It should not be allowed to happen.
Speaker 3: (01:47)
Your own DNI said the call transcript was consistent with the complaint. So, should [crosstalk 00:01:54].
Donald Trump: (01:53)
No, no. He didn’t say that. You have to take a look. No, no, no. He did not say that. And in fact, if you look at what he said, he found everything to be very normal. He’s a good man. And Joe, and he found it to be very normal. I saw Schiff trying to go 15… I call him Shifty Schiff. We don’t call him Shifty Schiff for nothing. He’s a shifty, dishonest guy, who by the way was critical of one of the great Secretary of States, graduated number one in his class at West Point, graduated top of it. One of the top of his class at Harvard Law School, the most honorable person, Mike Pompeo. And this guy was negative when Mike Pompeo… There’s an expression, “he couldn’t carry his blank strap.” I won’t say it because they’ll say it was so terrible to say, but that guy couldn’t carry his blank strap. You understand that?
Donald Trump: (02:45)
So you deal with bad people. And I watched China over the last few days and I watched some of these other countries build up, build up, build up, and we’ve built up more than any of them because of me. But no help due to the Democrats. They’re a disaster. They’re the Do Nothing Democrats. They don’t do any work. All they want to do is try and win the election in 2020. So they come up with this impeachment nonsense and everyone knows. The conversation, all based on one phone call that I had where I’m talking to the president of Ukraine. You’ll hear from our ambassadors, you’ll hear from some of the folks that know all about the call, why the call was set up and everything else. It’s perfect. The call was perfect. In fact, Lindsey Graham said, “I didn’t know you could be so nice.”
Donald Trump: (03:31)
There was no quid pro quo. Remember before they said, the only reason I put that out, and I did it with the approval of Ukraine by the way, otherwise I couldn’t have done it, was because the whistleblower was so dishonest. The whistleblower said terrible things about the call, but I then found out he was second hand and third hand. In other words, he didn’t know I was on the call. No, these are bad people. These are dishonest people.
Donald Trump: (03:55)
And when the American people find out what happened, it’s going to be a great day and you know what? We have to go back to building our country because 99% of Nancy Pelosi’s time is spent on this. She should worry about lowering the price of drugs, which I’ve done. But it’s hard to do it without the help of Congress. About creating border security, which I’ve done. We now have hundreds of miles of wall under construction on the southern border. She should worry about infrastructure. She should worry about the USMCA. She’s not doing it.
Donald Trump: (04:27)
I just saw a part of her press conference before the president of Canada. I’m sorry to bother you with this, Mr. President because we have other things to talk about, but I will tell you I just watched part. She says, “Oh, drug prices.” Well, she’s been trying to get drug prices down for… How long has she been in Congress? For years. She should focus on her own district. Do you see what’s happening to her district? We call it tent city. It’s terrible. In fact, we just sent a violation to the city of San Francisco, unsafe water, unsafe conditions, environmental. EPA. Our EPA, which is doing a great job, is sending Nancy Pelosi with all the talk about EPA. There’s needles and drugs all over the street. There’s tents. There’s people that are dying in squalor in the best location in San Francisco.
Donald Trump: (05:16)
It used to be a great city. Now you have to see what’s happened to San Francisco. You happen to see what the Democrats have allowed to happen, as an example, what they’ve allowed to happen. Just take a look to Los Angeles, great cities. One other thing, yesterday, as you know I was sued by the governor, Gavin Newsom. He’s another beauty. I was sued by him. He’s a do nothing. Sued by him so that I can’t get on the ballot in the State of California. It was a massive story. It was the biggest story, Mr. President, it was headlines all over the place. Trump gets sued by this do nothing governor in California. It was big.
Donald Trump: (06:01)
Here’s what happened. Yesterday, I won the case very convincingly. A very tough, smart, highly respected judge, not a Trump person at all, not appointed by Trump, appointed by somebody that you would call the opposition, came out with a scathing and tough opinion. I won the case. I didn’t see one story that I won that case. Not one story from the fake news. I didn’t see Steve write it. I didn’t see you write it. I didn’t see anybody write it.
Donald Trump: (06:34)
So let me just tell you just to finish Nancy Pelosi and Shifty Schiff, who should resign in disgrace by the way, and Jerry Nadler and all of them. It’s a disgrace what’s going on. And we should be focused on making America great again and keeping America great because that’s what we have to do. And when I look at that parade with military and millions of people and everything else, we better get smart. We better start focusing on the right things because what they did with this nonsense, think of it.
Donald Trump: (07:08)
You have a perfect, I mean perfect conversation with a president of another country, Ukraine in this case. And they try and say, “Oh, let’s impeach them.” They’ve been trying to impeach me from the day I got elected. I’ve been going through this for three years. They’ve been trying to impeach me from the day I got elected. And you know what? They failed. And This is the easiest one of all because this one is based on one conversation. What about Obama’s conversation with the president of Russia where he says, “Hey, hey, tell Vlad I’ll talk to him after the election’s over. I’ll talk to him.” Nobody reports that. That stuff you should report.
Donald Trump: (07:52)
But you people should be ashamed of yourself. We have the most dishonest media that you can imagine, and you should be ashamed of yourselves. Okay. I think I’ve answered most of your questions. What do you think? Yes.
Speaker 4: (08:03)
Finland media here, Finland is the happiest country in the world.
Donald Trump: (08:04)
Finland is a happy country.
Speaker 4: (08:06)
What can you learn? What can you learn from Finland [crosstalk 00:08:08]?
Donald Trump: (08:07)

Sauli Niinisto: (08:11)
We discuss about that.
Donald Trump: (08:13)
Finland is a happy country. He’s a happy leader too.
Speaker 5: (08:18)
Mr. President, are you going to cooperate with the-
Donald Trump: (08:20)
No Republicans have raised concerns.
Speaker 5: (08:21)
-about the whistleblower, that the identity of the whistleblower should be protected.
Donald Trump: (08:26)
I don’t care. Look, I think a whistleblower should be protected if the whistleblower’s legitimate. But when the whistleblower makes a big report on the conversation I had with a president of Ukraine and it was a great conversation. We talk mostly about congratulations on your win. We talked about corruption and what really referring mostly to 2016 because what the Democrats did in 2016 was corrupt. And let’s see what happens. They’re more concerned with that than they are with me and impeachment. They’re trying to hide what maybe is coming. I let our great, if you look, I’ll let our great law enforcement take care of it.
Donald Trump: (09:10)
Attorney General Barr I guess is working on it. And I hope he’s working on it because what happened in 2016 is a disgrace to this country. And they’re more worried about that because they know they’re guilty as hell. All right. They’re much more worried about that.
Speaker 3: (09:25)
The whistleblower immediately illegitimate, if they are reporting this [crosstalk 00:09:29].
Donald Trump: (09:29)
When a whistleblower… Okay. Are you ready? I heard the whistleblower’s report from you people. And how bad it was about just a simple conversation. By the way, this whole thing revolves around a simple conversation. And if you remember at the beginning, it was quid pro quo. That’s all you heard about. And I think you said seven or eight times quid… In other words, “You are going to do that or we’re not going to give you money. You’re going to do this or we’re not going to…” I never said it.
Donald Trump: (09:59)
But when I heard these horrible stories come out, I had no choice but to release a conversation, which I hate to do and I hope I don’t have to do it again with the leader of a country. I asked a certain person to call up a certain person in that country to get permission to do it. Otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to do it. And if I didn’t do it, and I appreciate Ukraine for allowing us to release the conversation. But it was so innocent. It didn’t hurt them if anything had helped them because there was a very innocent conversation.
Donald Trump: (10:29)
But when a whistleblower takes that very nice, innocent… Lindsey Graham said, “I never knew you were that nice a person.” He said, “You never asked him for anything. You were really, really nice.” Lindsey was saying, “I never knew you was so nice. That was a perfect conversation.” I heard Rick Scott today say, “That was a perfect conversation. How can they impeach him on that conversation?” He read it. He’s a very smart guy from Florida, Rick Scott, and he said, “That was a perfect conversation. How can you impeach somebody on that conversation?”
Donald Trump: (10:59)
But the whistleblower wrote not that conversation. He wrote a vicious conversation. In other words, he either got it totally wrong, made it up, or the person giving the information to the whistleblower was dishonest. And this country has to find out who that person was because that person’s a spy, in my opinion. You ready?
Donald Trump: (11:20)
So when a whistleblower purposely or not gives something that’s totally erroneous. Now here’s where I fooled them. They never thought I’d released the conversation. They’d never thought in a million years that I’d released the conversation. When little Adam Schiff saw the text, when he read it, he couldn’t believe it. When Nancy Pelosi, who worked a day early, Nancy Pelosi called for essentially impeachment, let’s impeach the president, before she saw the transcript. And this is an exact word for word transcript of the conversation. Taken by very talented stenographers. Listen to me. So when she saw that, I heard she went crazy.
Donald Trump: (12:06)
She said, “We can’t impeach him of this conversation. That’s a great conversation.” She went by the whistleblower and the whistleblower was so bad. I wouldn’t even think about it. But here’s what happened. The whistleblower was wrong. The only thing that matters is the transcript of the actual conversation that I had with the president of Ukraine. It was perfect. We’re looking at congratulations. We’re looking at doing things together and what are we looking at? We’re looking at corruption.
Donald Trump: (12:36)
And in, I believe 1999, there was a corruption act or corruption bill passed and signed between both countries where I have a duty to report corruption. And let me tell you something, biden’s son is corrupt and Biden is corrupt, and I’d rather run against Biden than almost any of those candidates. And I think they’re all week, but I think Biden has never been a smart guy and he’s less smart now than he ever was. Thank you very much. [crosstalk 00:13:09]

Let me do that again. It’s a fair question. So this morning and last night, my comms people came to me, listen to this one president. I’m glad they’re interested in Finland, but what can you do. I’m interested in Finland much more. But my comms people came to me and they said, “Sir, there’s a book or something being written.” It’s written by Washington post people, so you know it’s inaccurate. You know it’s probably a fraud. So two reporters of the Washington… and they said “President Trump started screaming, ranting and raving that on the southern border, where we are right now building a tremendous wall, it’s unbelievable what’s going on. Army Corps of Engineers. We’re doing a lot. We’ll soon have over a hundred miles under construction completed and we’re going to end up with over 400 to 500 miles. Okay, ready?
Donald Trump: (14:04)
That I wanted a wall, but I wanted a moat, a moat, whatever that is. Not a word I used, but they used it. A moat. And in the moat I wanted alligators and snakes, and I wanted the wall to be a fence, and I want it to be electrified, and I wanted sharp spikes at the top, so if anyone gets it, it goes piercing through their skin is somewhat the way they said it. Skin piercing spikes. But I want that whole wall to be electrocuted. And “Sir, you never said that.” They came to me, the comms people, they came to me yesterday and they said, “Did you say this?” I said, “Why are you asking that stupid question?”
Donald Trump: (14:47)
Because the fake news media is saying that you said this in a book. I said, “What book?” And they said, “Washington Post.” I said, “Well, obviously it’s fake because almost everything the Washington Post does is fake. It’s a fake newspaper. It’s owned by a rich guy for the purposes of giving him power in Washington. I mean it’s a lobbyist.” I call it the lobbyist Washington Post for Amazon. And he ought to be ashamed of himself because what they do to his reputation, I think maybe it’s probably no good anyway. But what they do to his reputation with the Washington post is a disgrace.
Donald Trump: (15:19)
So these two reporters wrote this book and they said, “I want a moat with alligators, snakes electrified fences so people get electrocuted if they so much as touch the fence and spikes on top.” Never said it, never thought of it. And I actually put out something on social media today. I said “I’m tough on the border, but I’m not that tough.” Okay. It was a lie. Just so you have it. You asked a question, it was a total lie. It was corrupt reporting.
Donald Trump: (15:45)
I don’t even use fake anymore. I call the fake news now corruptors because fake isn’t tough enough, and I’m the one that came up with the term. I’m very proud of it, but I think I’m going to switch it largely to corrupt news because the media in this country, not everybody, we have some great reporters, some great journalists, but much of it is corrupt. It’s corrupt. You have corrupt media in this country, and it truly is the enemy of the people. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. [crosstalk 00:16:12].
Speaker 6: (16:13)
Mr. President, will you release the [crosstalk 00:16:16] transcripts, sir.
Donald Trump: (16:17)
Thank you.
Afternoon Press Conference Transcript
Donald Trump: (00:00)
Much. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (00:08)
Look at all the press that you attract. Do you believe this? That’s really impressive.
Pres. Niinistö: (00:12)
I guess they are not after me.
Donald Trump: (00:15)
I hope not. You’re lucky. Thank you very much. Today it’s my honor to welcome President Niinistö of Finland to the White House, and Mr. President, it’s wonderful to host you once again in Washington. We’ve gotten to know each other over the last period of time, and it’s been a great experience. The President and I have just concluded very productive discussions on a number of exciting opportunities for our two nations. Before going further, I want to express our deep condolences over the horrific stabbing attack that took place yesterday at a college in Finland. America is praying for the victims and their families, and we send our unwavering love and support.
Pres. Niinistö: (00:59)
Thank you.
Donald Trump: (01:01)
The American and Finnish people are linked by an abiding commitment to self-government, individual rights, democracy, and the rule of law. This past May, our countries celebrated the 100th anniversary of America’s recognition of the independent nation of Finland in 1919. As President Wilson wrote at the time, “Our recognition was prompted by the sympathies for a cause similar to that which caused our own Declaration of Independence in 1776.”
Donald Trump: (01:36)
A century after we established diplomatic relations, United States and Finland remained United by those same cherished values. Central to this effort is our nation’s close cooperation on matters of security and defense. Although Finland is not a member of NATO, save a lot of money, Finland participates in many NATO missions and exercises, and I’m pleased that Finland is substantially increasing its military budget. America and Finland are also working together to advance stability, freedom of navigation, and respect for national sovereignty in the Arctic. Both of our nations are committed to a secure Arctic region, free from external intrusion, interference and coercion. Simply put, we believe that the affairs of the Arctic should be governed by the actual nations of the Arctic. And as you know, there are other people coming into the Arctic, and we don’t like it, and we can’t let it happen, and we won’t let it happen.
Donald Trump: (02:39)
The United States and Finland are likewise partnering to ensure the security of 5G networks. It is critical that we use safe and trustworthy technology providers, components, and supply chains. We welcome the establishment of the UROS Innovation Center in Finland, Qualcomm has done a fantastic job with that. This Innovation Center will greatly expand American and Finnish businesses and cooperation in 5G. We’re also glad that the Finnish company, Nokia, it’s a great company, a global leader in 5G technology is developing its cutting edge products right here in the United States at Bell Labs in New Jersey.
Donald Trump: (03:23)
Across the United States, foreign direct investment from Finland totals over $10 billion. Each year, Finnish owned companies invest more than $120 million in research and development in America, and expand our exports by more than $1 billion. Just today, Finnish Nokian Tires opened a new manufacturing plant in Dayton, Tennessee, a $360 million investment that is creating hundreds of brand new beautiful jobs for a great state, Tennessee. We love Tennessee, so they made a wise choice. You never lose when you go to Tennessee.
Donald Trump: (04:06)
I encourage other Finnish companies to increase their investments in the United States. There has simply never been a better time to do business in America. We have passed the largest tax cuts and reform, and also regulation cuts in the history of our country. We slashed business tax, and we’re fueling job growth through our record setting campaign to abolish all of those really terrible unnecessary regulations. We have plenty of regulations, but many of them we didn’t need. We got rid of them. The American economy is booming, wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and unemployment has hit its lowest level and more than half a century. We want Finnish companies to join in America’s extraordinary economic revival. So many countries are coming in, it’s the hot place. We have the hottest economy in the world, and it’s the hot place to be. They all want to be here.
Donald Trump: (05:01)
The President and I are also working on a way to improve international trade based on the principle of fairness, and my favorite word, reciprocity. I hope that Finland, which now holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, will support our efforts to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement with the European Union. We are going to have to start doing something with the European Union because they have not been treating this country right for many, many years, and they know it, and I tell them, and they know it. America’s trade deficit with the EU has been averaging $160 billion a year for many, many years. Achieving more balanced and robust trade flows would greatly benefit both Finland and the United States. We also appreciate Finland’s strong partnership in combating predatory trade practices worldwide, including the theft of intellectual property.
Donald Trump: (05:58)
From trade to security, from travel to commerce, we are immensely grateful for our close and deeply valued friendship with the people of Finland. Great people. And we’re now working on a deal to sell a large number of airplanes, fighter jets, hopefully, to Finland. See how that works out, but we make the greatest jets in the world, we make the greatest missiles and military equipment anywhere in the world. Nobody’s even close.
Donald Trump: (06:23)
Mr. President, I want to thank you again for visiting the White House. The history of our two nations is a profound testament to the importance of our independence and resolve to defend it. I look forward to continuing to work alongside of you as we safeguard our precious sovereignty and build a bright future of hope, harmony, and peace for the American and Finnish people. And thank you very much for being with us at the White House and the Oval Office. We had a very special number of hours. Appreciate it very much, thank you sir.
Pres. Niinistö: (06:57)
Thank you, Mr. President. First of all, I will deliver your condolences to Finnish people.
Donald Trump: (07:05)
Please.
Pres. Niinistö: (07:05)
They do appreciate that. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, before meeting, I had some spare time, so I visited a couple of museums here, Museum of American History, Museum of American African History, and Museum of American Indian History. In addition to that, I had a possibility of attending ceremony in Arlington. Mr. President, you have here a great democracy. Keep it going on.
Pres. Niinistö: (07:49)
We had a very good discussion with the President. Like you mentioned, our diplomatic relations are 100 years old. During that time, we have developed our cooperation a lot, not only in official meetings like this, but American and Finnish people, scientists for example, meet each other, cooperating, working together. We have quite a lot of cooperation in the security sector, also in defense because I think that we share the feeling that the most important thing for the nation is to guarantee security to its citizens, and that is the starting point for Finland also to this cooperation.
Pres. Niinistö: (08:44)
I wanted to take up with the President the importance of Trans-Atlantic cooperation. Well, we all know Europe needs USA, but I say that USA needs also Europe. We know the price of everything. We should recognize also the value of everything. We share the same values, democracy, human rights, rule-based order, and in that we are very similar. Europe has, in a way, awaken during the couple of last years to understand also more about security point of view. And I just want to tell you that in my opinion the stronger Europe we have, the stronger partner you have.
Pres. Niinistö: (09:49)
The Arctic area, you know Finland is in very North, is becoming more and more interesting, like the president said. We both, alongside with the six countries, form the Arctic Council, and we are working heavily. There are surely possibilities like we have heard the maritime routes are being open, to maybe there are also resources, but there are huge risks. One of them is that we should keep the low tension we are used to have there, and that is what we have been discussing. And I do appreciate President’s position to emphasize that it is not a place for military.
Pres. Niinistö: (10:45)
But an even greater challenge is the environment, and I’m very glad that we started to talk two years ago in this very house about black coal. It is not maybe the worst which causes climate problems, but it is, everybody can understand that if black comes down to ice and to snow, when the sun meets it, it melts down. And melting of sea ice in Arctic is very crucial. I used to say that if we lose the Arctic, we lose the globe.
Pres. Niinistö: (11:38)
We had a couple of words, very important ones, on arms control. We, some of us, remember the worst years of Cold War in 1960s. There was no agreement at all, just Cold War. We can’t let the situation return, no agreement at all about arms control, and that is why it is important to try to negotiate new agreements and to continue the New START Agreement. That will be a good new start for international cooperation on that.
Pres. Niinistö: (12:24)
To end up with, you, Mr. President, referred to 5G. [Inaudible 00:12:30] use of ICT as a whole, we are very proud to have the new center of excellence of hybrid in Helsinki. USA has been very helpful in that. Very many countries are working there together to fight against the future danger of hybrid warfare. But comes to providers in that area, I am not too very willing to point out any country or company. We are now, maybe a bit late from USA, in EU making a risk assessment. It will be prepared in one, two weeks time, and after that we are in a place that we have to choose the tools to protect us.
Pres. Niinistö: (13:34)
Mr. President, I want to thank you very much for having a possibility of meeting you here. It is very valuable, and I found discussions very open, very interesting, and giving a lot to my little country. Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (13:55)
Before we take questions, something happened that’s been going on for many decades, and we came to a conclusion. Could I ask Ambassador Pence to just come up for one second and explain the importance of what just took place? Because this has been going on for-
Pres. Niinistö: (14:12)
Wonderful.
Donald Trump: (14:12)
… many, many years. This is Ambassador Pence, no relationship to our great Vice President. Hard to believe. Nobody believes that, but that’s true.
Pres. Niinistö: (14:20)
[Inaudible 00:00:14:21].
Donald Trump: (14:25)
Right?
AmbassadorPence: (14:25)
But I have been introduced as his father, his brother, his cousin, his uncle. And we are friends. Good afternoon. When I arrived in Helsinki about a year and a half ago, there were a stack of papers on the desk, one of a couple of which concerned indigenous peoples from the Southwestern United States, Arizona, Colorado, including probably most predominantly, but generically, I will refer to them as Hopi Indians. They were one of the group in 1895, a lot of their remains had been excavated and removed along with about 500 artifacts to Finland. And there they’ve remained, despite a lot of activity to get them back. I’ll just jump to the end, and say through the good offices of our State Department, but in particular President Niinistö and to his entire team, we’ve secured and mutual agreement whereby all of those remains, including a number of petrified bodies, will be going back to be put back where they were buried.
AmbassadorPence: (15:41)
So special to us, and I think it’s probably special to indigenous peoples everywhere around the globe that we’re all concerned about paying appropriate respect to those who have departed before us. So thank you. Thank both of the Presidents for supporting this.
Donald Trump: (16:07)
Thank you. Fantastic job. Thank you. Be careful.
AmbassadorPence: (16:08)
Thank you.
Pres. Niinistö: (16:08)
Thank you, sir.
Donald Trump: (16:08)
Thank you. That’s a great job, Mr. Ambassador. That’s been going on for many, many decades, so I just want to thank you. Outstanding.
Donald Trump: (16:17)
John Roberts.
John Roberts: (16:20)
Mr. President, thank you, President Niinistö. If I could, sir, I’ve got two pertinent questions to ask you, maybe I could ask them separately to get a fresh answer out of each one. Three house committees that are looking into the impeachment inquiry gave notice today that they will be sending a subpoena to the White House for documents and other materials. Will you cooperate with those subpoenas?
Donald Trump: (16:42)
Well, I always cooperate. This is a hoax. This is the greatest hoax. This is just a continuation of what’s been playing out, John, for the last … since my election, I would say if you want to, probably, we’ll find out soon, but probably even before my election. This is a fraudulent crime on the American people, but we’ll work together with Shifty Schiff-
Donald Trump: (17:03)
… crime when the American people, but we’ll work together with shifty Schiff and Pelosi and all of them and we’ll see what happens, because we did absolutely … I had a great call with the president of Ukraine. It was 100%. You have the transcript. And then Schiff went up and as the chairman of the committee, got up and related to call that didn’t take place. He made up the language. Hard to believe. Nobody’s ever seen this. I think he had some kind of a mental breakdown.
Donald Trump: (17:27)
But he went up to the microphone and he read a statement from the president of the United States as if I were on the call. Because what happened is when he looked at the sheet, which was an exact transcript of my call done by very talented people that do this, exact, word for word, he said, “Wow, he didn’t do anything wrong.”
Donald Trump: (17:47)
So he made it up. He went up to a microphone and in front of the American people and in Congress, he went out and he gave a whole presentation of words that the president of the United States never said. It has to be a criminal act. It has to be, and he should resign. Some people even say it was treason. But it was a very sad thing.
Donald Trump: (18:10)
Just so you know, the call was perfect, the real call, the call I made. Many people were on the line. I knew that because usually when I speak to foreign country leaders, you can name any one of them. But when I speak on the phone, I know that we have many people listening from various intelligence agencies. My knowledge. I know all about it. So this isn’t something like, “Oh, gee, I’m on the line. Let’s talk about a big secret.”
Donald Trump: (18:35)
This is many people on the line. I don’t even know how many but we’ll find out, I guess. But many people. Mike Pompeo was on the line. Didn’t say anything. Because they listen for both knowledge and for security reasons and for lots of reasons.
Donald Trump: (18:48)
But the president of Ukraine at the United Nations the other day, and previous to that, he announced through his spokesperson, said there was absolutely no pressure put on him. There was no quid pro quo at all.
Donald Trump: (19:04)
If you’ll look at this whistleblowers, which I have a lot of respectful for whistleblowers, but only when they’re real, his report of the phone call was totally different than the fact. But what got them was they never thought I was going to release the call, because I don’t like doing that. I don’t want to do it. I hope I don’t have to do it again.
Donald Trump: (19:23)
Release phone calls to foreign dignitaries, to foreign leaders. I don’t want to do that, John. I don’t want to do it again. But I did it with the permission of the Ukrainian government. We got permission. We called up their representatives and asked them would it be okay. Otherwise, I couldn’t have done it.
Donald Trump: (19:41)
If I wouldn’t have done it, I would have been exposed to a lie, because the whistleblower report, didn’t he say seven or eight times I said quid pro quo? In other words, “You’re going to do this or you’re not going to get money.”
Donald Trump: (19:53)
Now, in all fairness, Biden said it and he’s on tape. In all fairness, you have at least four United States senators, Democrats, that said it and they said it a lot stronger than even Schiff and his made-up story said it.
Donald Trump: (20:11)
Obama, when he was dealing with the president of Russia, not Putin, he said, “Hey, tell Vladimir I can do a lot more after the election.” You remember that? You didn’t make a big deal out of that. Everybody thought, “Oh, isn’t that cute? Isn’t that cute?”
Donald Trump: (20:29)
My talk and my response, Lindsay Graham said, “I never knew you were that nice. I can’t believe you were that nice.” He said that loud and clear. It was perfect. It was perfect. Not a thing wrong with it.
Donald Trump: (20:43)
To impeach a president over a fraud that was committed by other people that want to win an election in 2020, which they won’t, is incredible. This is the greatest hoax.
Donald Trump: (20:56)
Now, it’s gone on for a long time. We had the Mueller collusion delusion, okay? That went on for years and that’s finally done. No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing. It was a joke and everyone knows it and it was from the day one.
Donald Trump: (21:15)
So now, I get three days of peace and I’m walking into the United Nations, going to meet with the biggest leaders in the world, and I hear about the word “impeachment.” I said, “What did I do now?” It was about a beautiful conversation that I had. And just remember this: the Ukrainian new president, a fine man, said, “I don’t know what you’re talking about. There was no pressure,” and he said it a number of times.
Donald Trump: (21:40)
Okay. What’s your second question?
John Roberts: (21:41)
Just before-
Donald Trump: (21:41)
Well, you shouldn’t be asking two questions.
John Roberts: (21:43)
Well, you’re going to want to answer-
Donald Trump: (21:44)
Do me a favor. Ask one of the-
John Roberts: (21:46)
I will, but I think you’ll want to answer this question.-
Donald Trump: (21:50)
… Finnish … John, John. Ask one of the Finnish president.
John Roberts: (21:51)
Then can I come back to you? Because I think you’ll want to answer this.
Donald Trump: (21:53)
We’ll talk later. Sure. Well, it sounds like it might be a good question. Let me see if I like the question. Go ahead.
John Roberts: (21:58)
There-
Donald Trump: (21:59)
Maybe for the first time in three years, I’ll have a good question and I’ll love it.
John Roberts: (22:02)
There is a report that came out just before you and President Niinistö walked out here that the whistleblower met with a staff member of Adam Schiff prior to [crosstalk 00:22:12]-
Donald Trump: (22:11)
Oh, I love that question.
John Roberts: (22:12)
… being filed.
Donald Trump: (22:12)
It shows that Schiff is a fraud and I love that question. Thank you. John.
John Roberts: (22:17)
Can I finish asking it?
Donald Trump: (22:19)
Yes. There’s nothing to finish.
John Roberts: (22:21)
So the whistleblower, according to this report, met with a member of Adam Schiff’s staff. You’ve got it right there. You know it.
Donald Trump: (22:28)
I hate to say it’s a New York Times. I can’t believe they wrote it.
John Roberts: (22:31)
Your response to that-
Donald Trump: (22:32)
Maybe they’re getting better.
John Roberts: (22:33)
Your response to the fact that that happened and that Schiff may have learned some of what the whistleblower knew prior to the complaint was filed.
Donald Trump: (22:39)
Well, I think it’s a scandal that he knew before. I’d go a step further. I think he probably helped write it. Okay? That’s what the word is. And I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out.
Donald Trump: (22:51)
Just happened as I’m walking up here. They handed up to me and I said to Mike, I said, “Whoa, that’s something. That’s big stuff. That’s a big story.” He knew long before and he helped write it, too. It’s a scam. It’s a scam.
Donald Trump: (23:06)
Just to finish on this. I appreciate it. I love that second question, by the way. Should’ve asked it first. But let me just tell, you the whole thing is a scam. The Mueller deal was a scam. The Russian collusion was a scam. You can ask Putin.
Donald Trump: (23:25)
Nobody’s been rougher on Russia than Donald Trump. Okay? Now with that being said, it’d be great to get along with Russia and we will get along with Russia because it’s smart. But nobody’s been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. Okay. Ask one, please.
John Roberts: (23:41)
Yes, President Niinistö. Good to see you again. You had a conversation with President Trump about 5G and how Nokia, Finland’s big company, could fill in that space. You also met with Chinese President Xi during the summer, in which you renewed the ties of friendship between the two nations. Do you believe that countries, particularly Western countries, that put Huawei equipment in their 5G cores are at risk of national security?
Pres. Niinistö: (24:08)
Thank you. Like I told already in Europe, their situation is maybe a bit different from that here, because the main company you mentioned is inside Europe, partly at least. What European Union is now doing is making a risk assessment, asking each country what kind of experience, what you have seen and found out. That will be, well, finished in week two or two weeks time.
Pres. Niinistö: (24:44)
After that, we have to decide together in the European Union which kind of tools we need to protect ourselves. You refer to my discussions with President Xi. We didn’t talk about 5G while meeting, and we all know Nokia is a major factor in this area. They will answer for themselves. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (25:14)
You, please. Pick somebody who’s really nice from Finland.
Pres. Niinistö: (25:18)
No more Finnish-
Donald Trump: (25:19)
You have a really nice person?
Pres. Niinistö: (25:20)
Finnish?
Donald Trump: (25:21)
I think they were all nice in Finland.
Pres. Niinistö: (25:24)
Are there Finnish reporters? Just two. Okay.
Donald Trump: (25:30)
Uh oh.
Pres. Niinistö: (25:30)
Did I … Wait a minute. Yes.
Mari Karppinen: (25:35)
I’m Mari Karppinen from MTV News Finland and I have one question for President Trump and one question for President Niinistö. First, Mr. Trump. How will this political storm affect the US foreign policy, especially its relationship with Finland. And second for President Niinistö, because this is the biggest issue here at the moment, I have to ask what kind of favors has Mr. Trump asked from you?
Donald Trump: (25:59)
Or the other way around him?
Pres. Niinistö: (26:03)
What favors I asked or was asked.
Donald Trump: (26:05)
I think you mean the other way around.
Pres. Niinistö: (26:07)
Both ways. Okay.
Donald Trump: (26:09)
So the political storm, I’ve lived with it from the day I got elected. I’ve done more and this administration has done more than any administration in the history of this country in the first two and a half years. I’m used to it. For me, it’s like putting on a suit in the morning.
Donald Trump: (26:25)
People have said to me, “How does he handle it?” Rush Limbaugh, said, “I don’t know of any man in America that could handle it.” Sean Hannity said the same thing. Others have said the same thing: “I don’t know any man in America because it’s all a fraud.” And because of that and because I know that I’m right and because I’m doing a great job for the American people, I’m very, very happy living the way I’m living.
Donald Trump: (26:50)
I thought that I would finish off the first term without the threat of people making false claims. But this one turned out to be incredible all because they didn’t know that I had a transcript done by very, very talented people. Word for word, comma for comma, done by people that do it for a living. We had an exact transcript.
Donald Trump: (27:15)
When we produced that transcript, they died. Because you look at the whistleblower statement and it’s vicious, vicious. And that whistleblower, there’s no question in my mind that some bad things have gone on and I think we’ll get to the bottom of it. I think it’s going to be a total reversal.
Donald Trump: (27:35)
But I’ve lived with this. I’ve lived with this cloud now for almost three years. More than that, because it probably started even before.
Donald Trump: (27:46)
I think nobody has done what I’ve done. When you look at tax cuts and regulation cuts and rebuilding our military and right-to-try, right-to-try. That means people that are terminally ill and very sick have the right to use our medicines, our great medicines, because we’re so far ahead of every other country. So many things that we’ve done.
Donald Trump: (28:07)
Our vets are now taken care of. We’ve got Choice. Nobody thought we could ever get Choice. That’s when you have to wait on line as a vet. You go outside, you get a doctor, we pay the bill. You don’t have to wait for three weeks to see a doctor if you’re a vet. We cherish our vets, at least this administration does. But for many years, they didn’t, but I take care of the vets. No administration has done. And I’ve lived with it from the day I got elected, so I’m just fine with it. Okay? Please.
Pres. Niinistö: (28:36)
Yes. We had a conversation and discussion on a very equal basis, which is I really appreciate that. Well, I had one request, specifically. I wanted the president to take more notice on transatlantic relations, because I consider it’s useful both for USA and Europe.
Pres. Niinistö: (29:04)
While we were discussing also trading, I told the president that the big purchase we are doing on fighters will be finished in two years time. We have five different candidates, three from Europe and two from United States. He answered that, “Ours is best.”
Donald Trump: (29:33)
Jeff, go ahead.
Jeff Mason: (29:36)
Thank you, sir. Jeff Mason from Reuters. Mr. President, I’d like to ask you about your use of the word “treason.” You’ve used it repeatedly in the last few days. Do you consider anyone who opposes you treasonous?
Donald Trump: (29:49)
No. No. I consider when they lie, when they stand before our great body in our great chamber and they make up a story that’s fiction like Schiff did. He took that perfect conversation I had with the Ukrainian president and he made it into a total lie. It was a total fabrication. And you do admit that. It was a total fabrication. He said this is what …
Donald Trump: (30:15)
The only ones that don’t like my conversation are the ones that never read it, but they heard shifty Schiff. That’s what I call a lie. And because of the fact that he’s lying about the president of the United States and as to what the president says, believe it or not, I watch my words very carefully.
Donald Trump: (30:34)
There are those that think I’m a very stable genius. Okay? I watch my words very, very closely. And to have somebody get up and to totally fabricate a conversation that I had with another leader and make it sound so bad, it was so evil.
Donald Trump: (30:53)
Now I see this that just came out minutes ago, where he met at a time that was impossible to have done unless there’s corruption involved. And just so you know, we’ve been investigating on a personal basis through Rudy and others, lawyers, corruption in the 2016 election. We’ve been investigating corruption because I probably will … I was going to definitely, but I probably will be bringing a lot of litigation against a lot of people having to do with the corrupt investigation, having to do with the 2016 election.
Jeff Mason: (31:30)
For example?
Donald Trump: (31:30)
I have every right to do that, because the way they’ve treated me and other people, they’ve destroyed people. They’ve destroyed their lives with a phony charge that never existed and that was collusion. Never existed.
Donald Trump: (31:42)
You had 18 people that hated Donald Trump and you had Bob Mueller that hated Donald Trump. And in the end, they couldn’t find one damn thing. I could find it on you. They couldn’t find one thing about Donald Trump having to do with collusion. This is after two years and spending $42 million. I’ve been looking at that long and hard for a long period of time. How it started, why it started. It should never happen to another president, ever. But I’ve been talking about it from the standpoint of bringing a major lawsuit and I’ve been talking about it for a long time.
Donald Trump: (32:15)
We’ve been investigating the corruption having to do with what they did to my people. They destroyed many people. They came down to Washington to do a great job and they left home. They left Washington dark. They were dark. They came down here, I say bright-eyed and bushy-tail. They wanted to do a great job for the people. They wanted to do a great job.
Donald Trump: (32:39)
We won the election and then they get served with subpoenas. All these subpoenas. Now look at Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi hands out subpoenas like … You know she has to approve it. She hands out subpoenas like they’re cookies: “You want to subpoena? Here you go. Take them.” Like they’re cookies. Paul Ryan would never give anybody a subpoena. He wouldn’t give them. When Mark Meadows went in to talk, he wouldn’t give them. When Jim Jordan went in, when Devin Nunez, he would go in and they’d see Paul. I’m not saying wrong or right.
Donald Trump: (33:13)
But Paul Ryan: “No, let’s talk about it. That’s a big thing to give a subpoena. Let’s talk about it.” Two weeks later, they’re still talking. They wanted subpoenas to investigate the corrupt Democrats and the corrupt people on the other side. Paul Ryan would not give subpoenas. Nancy Pelosi? “Here you go. Take it. Who wants a subpoena?” Every day you get subpoenas. And Paul Ryan was actually right, probably, because they should never, ever, allow a thing like this to happen to our country again. Thank you very much. Please,
Jeff Mason: (33:46)
Mr. President, can you just make clear right here? What did you want President’s Zelensky to do with regard to Joe and Hunter Biden?
Donald Trump: (33:56)
If you look at what he said, okay? And he brought it up. I think he brought up the name Rudy Giuliani. What-
Donald Trump: (34:03)
And he brought it up. I think he brought up the name Rudy Giuliani. What I want is the following, and I’ve said this loud and clear. We have our ambassadors here. We have Mike Pence here. Why are we the only ones that give the big money to the Ukraine? We give money to Ukraine. And it’s bothered me from day one, and you have plenty of people just here. I say, how come it’s always the United States that gets ripped? Frankly, Ukraine, we want to help them, and I do like the new president. You know why I like him? Because he was honest. Because he said there was no pressure at all exerted on me, meaning him, by the President of the United States. He said it. By the way, that one sentence should stop this, but he said there was no pressure exerted, but you don’t have to ask him.
Donald Trump: (34:48)
All you have to do is read the transcript. Read the telephone call. But what I was having a problem with the two things, number one, Ukraine is no, before him for tremendous corruption. Tremendous, more than just about any country in the world. In fact, they’re rated one of the most corrupt countries in the world. And I don’t like giving money to a country that’s that corrupt. Number two-
Speaker 1: (35:15)
You don’t like giving money-
Donald Trump: (35:16)
I said, excuse me, number two, I said the following, and I said this loud and clear to everybody, and in fact Rob Portman backed me up, and there’s nobody more honorable than Rob Portman of Ohio. Because he called up, “Please, let the money go.” I said, “Rob, I hate being the country that’s always giving money, when Ukraine helps Europe, and the European countries far more than they help us.” They’re like a wall between Russia and Europe. They’re like a wall, they’re a big, wide, beautiful wall. And he said, “You know what, but it’s important.” And in fact, he came out and he said that, that was my only reason. Because I don’t like being the sucker country. We were the sucker country for years and years. We’re not the sucker country anymore. But I gave the money because Rob Portman and others called me and asked. But I don’t like to be the sucker, and European countries are helped far more than we are, and those countries should pay more to help Ukraine. Ask a question please.
Speaker 2: (36:13)
Thank you sir.
Speaker 1: (36:14)
What about Biden? What about Mr. Biden?
Jeff Mason: (36:16)
What did you want about Biden? What did you want him to look into on Biden?
Speaker 1: (36:19)
Look, Biden, and his son are stone cold crooked, and you know it. His son walks out with millions of dollars, the kid knows nothing. You know it. And so do we. Go ahead ask a question over here.
Jeff Mason: (36:33)
The question, sir was what did you want President Zelensky to do about Vice President Biden and his son Hunter?
Donald Trump: (36:40)
Are you talking to me?
Jeff Mason: (36:41)
Yeah, it was just a follow-up of what I just asked you sir.
Donald Trump: (36:43)
Listen, are you ready? We have the president of Finland. Ask him a question.
Jeff Mason: (36:47)
I have one for him. I just wanted to follow up on the one that I asked you, which was what did you want-
Donald Trump: (36:50)
Did you hear me? Did you hear me?
Jeff Mason: (36:52)
Yes sir.
Donald Trump: (36:52)
Ask him a question.
Jeff Mason: (36:53)
I will.
Donald Trump: (36:54)
I’ve given you a long answer. Ask this gentleman a question. Don’t be rude.
Jeff Mason: (36:59)
No sir. I don’t want to be rude. I just wanted you to have a chance to answer the question that I asked you.
Donald Trump: (37:03)
I’ve answered everything. It’s a whole hoax, and you know who’s playing into the hoax, people like you, and the fake news media that we have in this country. And I say in many cases the corrupt media, because you’re corrupt. Much of the media in this country is not just fake, it’s corrupt. And you have some very fine people, too. Great journalists, great reporters, but to a large extent, it’s corrupt, and it’s fake. Ask the president of Finland a question please.
Jeff Mason: (37:31)
Okay, I’ll move on now. Mr. President, in your opening remarks, you said to President Trump that you had been to some museums today, and that you respected the US democracy and encouraged him to continue it. Are you concerned that that’s not happening? And my second question to you, sir, is the WTO rule today in favor of the United States saying that the United States can now impose tariffs on European goods because of illegal subsidies against Airbus.
Donald Trump: (37:58)
That was a big win for the United States, right?
Jeff Mason: (38:01)
It was a big win for the United States.
Donald Trump: (38:02)
You never had wins with other presidents, did you? But we’re having a lot of wins at the WTO since I became president.
Jeff Mason: (38:07)
This was a case that started I think 10 or 15 years ago.
Donald Trump: (38:10)
Excuse me. Get Windsor now, because they think I don’t like the WTO, and they want to make sure I’m happy, because all of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years. They know that I’m wise to it. We’ve had a lot of wins. This was a $7 billion win, not bad.
Pres. Niinistö: (38:26)
But I think the question is for me.
Jeff Mason: (38:28)
So the question sir is if you’re concerned that the president will impose those tariffs, and the effect that that may have on the economy.
Pres. Niinistö: (38:35)
Yes. First of all, may I refer to your democracy. I just wanted to tell that I’m impressed what American people have gained during these decades, hundreds of years. Peeling up very impressive democracy. So keep it going on. To WTO, I have a lot of respect to multi-lateralism, and to international institutions, so WTO has given now a decision which is well, quite tough with Europe, but I just say that the WTO has said its opinion, and that’s that.
Donald Trump: (39:32)
I just want to finish by saying it’s an honor to be with the President of Finland. He’s done a fantastic job, very popular, beloved, over in Finland. The WTO has been much better to us since I’ve been president, because they understand they can’t get away with what they’ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States. And please remember the president’s last remarks, that we are a great democracy. We are a great, the United States is a great democracy, and I’m airing what I’m airing, because we are in fact a democracy. And if the press were straight, and honest, and forthright, and tough, we would be a far greater nation.
Speaker 2: (40:19)
We are Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (40:20)
We would be a far greater, when we don’t have the CNNs of the world who are corrupt people. Thank you very much everybody.
Jeff Mason: (40:26)
Mr. President, [inaudible 00:40:30].
Reena Ninan: (40:38)
All right. We’re listening into a joint press conference with the President of Finland and President Trump there. I want to bring in CBSN political reporter, Caitlin Huey-Burns, and CBS news contributor and Republican strategist, Leslie Sanchez. Caitlin, I want to start with you. I mean the focus, obviously, the president very agitated. Looking, taking questions on about this impeachment inquiry and subpoenas. I want to get your take on exactly what the president had to say, Caitlin.
Caitlin: (41:03)
Right, and this comes after a lengthy, kind of impromptu press conference that he had with the President of Finland earlier in the oval office at what was supposed to be a photo op. So this is an extension of this, and proof that the president is really wanting to continue to talk about the investigation. He came prepared with a printout of the New York Times reporting that had just come out, that said that Adam Schiff had received information that the whistleblower was wanting to put forward in a report, and so he was earlier today criticizing the New York Times today praising for that report.
Caitlin: (41:45)
But he also said a few different things of note. He said Mike Pompeo was on the line for that call. We know the Secretary of State said that today. But again, confirming the reporting, he continued to berate Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who has become a punching bag for the president, likes to bring him up a lot, has even given him a nickname as well. He called this-
Reena Ninan: (42:12)
And Caitlin, I just want to mention, you know, the president has said that Schiff was given, helped the whistleblower write his complaint, which is an allegation that, in fact I want you to hear it directly from the president. Here’s what he had to say about that.
Donald Trump: (42:27)
Well, I think it’s a scandal that he knew before, I’d go a step further. I think he probably helped write it. Okay? That’s what the word is. And I think it’s a, I give a lot of respect for the New York Times for putting it out. Just happened as I’m walking up here, they handed it to me, and I said to Mike, I said, “Whoa, that’s something. That’s big stuff.” That’s a big story. He knew long before, and he helped write it too. It’s a scam. It’s a scam.
Reena Ninan: (42:55)
Well, the House Intelligence Committee has a very different take on all this, and they released a statement. I want to read it to you, and it says like other whistleblowers have done, before, and since under Republican and Democratic controlled committees, the whistleblower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community. This is a regular occurrence, given the committee’s unique oversight role and responsibilities. At no point did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance. I think we have Paula Reed at the White House. Paula, I want you to weigh in to get your sense as to what we’ve heard so far.
Paula Reid: (43:29)
Well the president was critically pleased with his New York Times story. As you noted, he walked out with a physical copy. Now we have to look at how Adam Schiff handled the hearing last week with acting DNI director Maguire. He opened that hearing in a very unusual way. He laid out his sort of mobster narrative of what had happened, and then he did sort of ad lib what happened in this conversation. It was very strange, Reena. Instead of just reading quotes from what had happened, and the president has seized on this. He has mentioned this repeatedly today, suggesting that Adam Schiff had apparently committed treason by putting words into the mouth of the president. So at every opportunity, when the president is asked about his conversation with the Ukraine, when he’s asked about withholding military aid, he just quickly pivots to Adam Schiff, and this New York Times story gives him more fodder. Because here he suggests this was a conspiracy against him, that Adam Schiff knew about this and helped push these accusations.
Reena Ninan: (44:28)
I want to get Leslie Sanchez to weigh in. Leslie, you know this nickname Shifty Schiff, he made a point of saying that, and the spokesman for Schiff came up very quickly. They knew that they had to put out this statement, but what do you make of what we’ve heard from them today?
Leslie Sanchez: (44:40)
I think it’s consistent with the way the president pushes back. I’ll tell you one thing, people appreciate that about the president. People that voted for him want to see that he’s going to punch back, and those are direct terms, we like that he does that. I think it was very consistent with him for him to say it was a hoax. This is a scam. He is using a parody of me, and defining that, because if you’re somebody who’s apolitical, you’re kind of generally following what’s happening, and you listen to this, that it’s so hyper-partisan that a decision was made before they ever heard the testimony, before we even saw the transcript of the call ,that the Democrats already had sealed the fate of the president in their minds. This is laying into that argument, and I think in that way the president made his points.
Reena Ninan: (45:23)
Caitlin, I want to get you to weigh in. In this statement from Patrick Boland, which is the spokesman for chairman Adam Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee. He made a point to say that at no point did the committee review, or receive the complaint in advance. The office of the director of national intelligence, at the behest of the White House refused to disclose the subject matter, or the substance of the complaint to the committee, and they went on to say the committee didn’t receive the complaint until the night before the acting director of the National Intelligence opened the hearing. But that is not what the president said today.
Caitlin: (45:54)
Right, and the reporting in the New York Times said that the whistleblower had expressed some concern about how the process was going, and therefore went to the committee. But that is not stopping the president, and Republicans who are also seizing on this, those who are supportive of the president seizing on this to make a case that this is a political situation here. And that’s what we’ve seen from Republicans throughout this entire affair, which is that they are by and large supportive of the president, and focused a lot on the process of how this all happened, instead of the underlying issues and questions. And you even heard the president there. I would note that he kept referencing the transcript, which he said was word for word, which is not what it was at the top of that-
Reena Ninan: (46:50)
There was a big statement at the bottom of that, yes, absolutely.
Caitlin: (46:52)
Sorry. At the bottom of that, right, exactly. Said that this was a summary of what happened, so it was not word for word. But I think it’s important to note that Republicans have stood by the president, and that is reflected in our polling on impeachment, on the impeachment inquiry, which shows that Republicans are still supportive of the president.
Reena Ninan: (47:13)
That’s a good point. President Trump said that he’d cooperate with the subpoenas. I want to play for you what he said just a short time ago.
John: (47:19)
Will you cooperate with those subpoenas?
Donald Trump: (47:21)
Well, I always cooperate. This is a hoax. This is the greatest hoax, this is just a continuation of what’s been playing out, John, for the last, since my election, I would say, if you wanted. Probably, we’ll find out soon, but probably even before my election. This is a fraudulent crime, when the American people…
Reena Ninan: (47:41)
Paula, we know that the President and the White House has stonewalled Congress on these efforts, the testimony and the documents, do we expect this to be any different?
Paula Reid: (47:49)
Absolutely not Reena. I’ve spoken to several of the president’s attorneys, both here at the White House and his outside counsel, and they really don’t see this impeachment inquiry that was announced last week as being anything significant. There argument is look, until Polosi holds a floor vote on impeachment, they are not under any more obligation to cooperate. So far, their MO in terms of congressional oversight has been to cooperate to the minimum required under law. They will negotiate, sometimes they’ll even litigate, but in terms of documents and witnesses, they try to give as little as they need to. Now, if there is a floor vote about a formal impeachment inquiry, that will dilute some of the president’s protections here. That makes it a little bit harder to hide behind executive privilege. I’m told that would be a game changer. But for the president to say that they always cooperate, well that is false.
Reena Ninan: (48:38)
So Paula, let’s say the president chooses not to cooperate at this point. I mean, is there a sense of what we’re seeing, the deadline is Friday, right? What are you looking and watching for in the coming days this week?
Paula Reid: (48:48)
I’m not sure specifically, there’s so many subpoenas. I mean, he’s not wrong that Nancy Polosi really does hand these out like cookies. That is fact check true. And the White House has just been blanketed in all of these various requests. They’ve tried to fend off many of them. In some cases they’ll negotiate, but going forward, I don’t think they’re going to change the way they process this. In some instances, if they think a court would compel them to share something, they will offer a compromise. Lawmakers can come to the White House, see thing…"
"Sep 23, 2019",4:52 P.M. EDT,"Audience: (00:00)
[inaudible 00:00:00] Modi! Modi! Modi! Modi! [inaudible 00:00:35]
Narendra Modi: (00:43)
Good morning, Houston. Good morning, [inaudible 00:00:45]. Good morning, America. Greetings to my fellow Indians in India and around the world.
Narendra Modi: (01:10)
Friends, this morning we have a very special person with us. He needs no introduction. His name is familiar to every person on the planet. His name comes up in almost every conversation in the world on global politics. His every world is followed by tens of millions. He was a household name and very popular even before he went on to occupy the highest office in this great country. From CEO to commander-in-chief, from boardrooms to the Oval Office, from studios to global stage, from politics to the economy and to security, he has left a deep and lasting impact everywhere.
Narendra Modi: (03:38)
Today, he is here with us. It is my honor and privilege to welcome here in this magnificent stadium and magnificent gathering. And I can say, I had a chance to meet him often and every time I found the friendliness, warmth, energy. The president of the United States of America, Mr. Donald Trump. This is extraordinary. This is unprecedented. Friends, as I told you, we have met a few times and every time he has been the same: warm, friendly, accessible, energetic, and full of wit. I admire him for something more. His sense of liberty, his passion for America, his concern for every American, his belief in American future, and a strong resolve to make America great again.
Narendra Modi: (06:11)
He has already made the American economy strong again. He has endured much for the United States and for the world. Friends, we in India have connected well with President Trump. The words, the words of candidate Trump, [foreign language 00:07:06], rang loud and clear. And his celebration of Diwali in the White House lit up millions of faces with joy and appreciation.
Narendra Modi: (07:24)
when I met him for the first time, he said to me, “India has a true friend in White House.” Your presence here today is great testimony to that. In these years, our two nations have taken that relationship to new heights. Mr. President, this morning in Houston, you can hear the heartbeat of this great partnership in this celebration of the world’s two largest democracies. You can feel the strength and depths of human bonds between our two great nations. People are at the heart of all relationships, from Houston to Hyderabad, from Boston to Bangaluru, from Chicago to Shimla, from Los Angeles to Ludhiana, from New Jersey to New Delhi, hundreds of millions are glued to that TV, even though it is in rather late on our Sunday night in India. Millions around the world in different time zones are with us today. They are witnessing history in the making. Mr. President, you had introduced me to your family in 2017 and today, I have the honor to introduce you to my family, all billion Indians and people of Indian heritage around the globe. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, my friend, a friend of India, a great American president, Mr. Donald Trump.
Audience: (12:26)
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! [inaudible 00:12:26]
Donald Trump: (12:46)
Hello, Houston. I am so thrilled to be here in the great state of Texas with one of America’s greatest, most devoted and most loyal friends, Prime Minister Modi of India. Thank you. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (13:08)
And Prime Minister Modi is doing a truly exceptional job for India and for all of the Indian people. It is my immense privilege to be here with him today at this profoundly historic event. We’re especially grateful to be joined by over 50,000 incredible members of our nation’s thriving, prospering, flourishing, and hardworking Indian American community. Thank you. Just a few months ago in the largest democratic election in the history of our world, 600 million Indians went to the polls and voted overwhelmingly for Prime Minister Modi and his party. Congratulations, Mr. Prime Minister. That’s a lot of people.
Donald Trump: (14:13)
Earlier this week, I understand you marked another important milestone. I know everyone here joins me in wishing you a very happy birthday. Happy birthday.
Donald Trump: (14:28)
I want to take a moment to address every resident of Houston effected by the recent horrible flooding. The entire American nation is standing by your side. We’re ready. We love you. We support you. We will be there with you every single step of the way. I just left the Coast Guard hanger at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base where I was briefed on the Texas flooding. We’re working with your great governor Greg Abbott, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, Attorney General Ken Paxton and senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. Thank you very much. We’re working hard together. My administration will not rest until you have fully recovered, restored, and rebuilt and I know you will come back with the same tremendous spirit that we have shown every single time, every time there’s been a problem. It’s called “Houston strong.” Prime Minister Modi and I have come to Houston to celebrate everything that unites America and India, our shared dreams and bright futures. I’ve also come to express my profound gratitude to the nearly 4 million amazing Indian Americans all across our country. You enrich our culture, you uphold our values, you uplift our communities and you are truly proud to be American and we are proud to have you as Americans. We thank you, we love you and I want you to know my administration is fighting for you each and every day. I want to recognize US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster and Minister Jaishankar of India. Thank you very much. Thank you both. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (16:45)
We’re also proudly joined by NASA Deputy Administrator Jim Morhard, Deputy Secretary Of Energy Dan Brouillette, Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky, your state attorney general, Ken Paxton, a couple of very great senators. Kevin, thank you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you. We have a lot of senators. We have a lot of Congress people. There’s Mr. Brady, Congressman Brady. He gave us a very, very nice tax cut folks. Thank you, Kevin, very much. Thank you all for being here. Among the leaders here today for this remarkable celebration are many members of the House and Senate. They’re all over the audience, including House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, and again, senators Cornyn, Cruz.
Donald Trump: (17:43)
In my campaign for president, I promised all of that. If we were elected, India would have a true and great friend in the White House and I can tell you, you have never had a better friend as president that President Donald Trump. That I can tell you. The prime minister knows that. On this day, I’m happy to report that the relationship between the United States and India is stronger than ever before. The ties between our two nations are grounded in our common values and our shared commitment to democracy. We are free nations with great faith and a fierce devotion to our national independence. We are governed by the rule of law, guided by commitment to justice, and strengthened by our love of liberty. Our two national constitutions both begin with the same three beautiful words, “We the People.”
Donald Trump: (18:59)
That means that in America AMD India alike, we honor, respect, trust, empower and fight for the citizens we proudly serve. Under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, the world is witnessing a strong sovereign and thriving Republic of India. In a single decade, with the help of Prime Minister Modi’s pro-growth reforms, India has lifted nearly 300 million people out of poverty and that is an incredible number. Incredible. That’s incredible. In the next decade, 140 million Indian households will rise to the middle class. In both India and the United States, we’re seeing something really remarkable. Our people are prospering like never before because we are slashing bureaucracy and cutting job killing red tape.
Donald Trump: (20:15)
In the United States, thanks to our massive tax cuts and all of our great senators and congressmen and women that are here today and pro worker policies, our economy is breaking one record after another. Since my election, we have created over 6 million new jobs. We have created over 750,000 jobs right here in Texas and very importantly, that includes 70,000 new Texas manufacturing jobs. They said that couldn’t be done. Unemployment … Think of this. Unemployment in Texas is currently at the lowest rate ever recorded in the history of our country, and unemployment in the United States has just reached the lowest level in over 51 years and very soon we think that will be broken to be a historic number. Unemployment among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Hispanic Americans have all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. Over the last two years, the unemployment rate among Indian Americans dropped by nearly 33 and one third percent. Wages are rising, incomes are soaring, and inequality is falling at the fastest rate in many, many years. In the past 12 months alone, the average worker has taken home $1,000 extra in rising wages and over $3,000 with tax cuts and all of the other things that we’ve done. And for the first time in history, most new hires of prime working age are minorities and women. First time that’s ever happened. Through our pledge to America’s workers, we have secured commitments for nearly 14 million employment and training opportunities for American workers done through our great American companies. We passed the biggest tax cuts and the biggest tax reforms in the history of our country. We slashed a record number of job killing regulations, giving the average American household more than $3,000 every year and never in the history of our country, no matter how long the presidency, have regulations been cut to this extent. Everyday, the Indian American community is helping to strengthen our country and build our future. Indian Americans are pioneering groundbreaking medicines to save countless lives. They’re developing revolutionary technology that is changing the world and they’re founding new businesses that provide jobs to thousands of our fellow citizens. Prime Minister Modi, I look forward to working with you to make our nations even more prosperous than ever before. And that’s what’s happening. The economic miracles taking place today are just beginning. Here in the United States, there has never been a better time to hire, invest, grow, and pursue your dreams.
Donald Trump: (24:25)
Indian companies employ tens of thousands of Americans across a range of industries, including American steel. In 2018 India’s JSW Steel announced that it would invest up to $500 million to revitalize a shuttered steel plant in the great state of Ohio. And we welcome India’s growing investments right here in the Lone Star State. Nations around the world are investing in the United States because they know we have the best economy and the best workers in the world. They have never invested in our country like they are today. And we want to thank everybody and India has never invested in the United States like it is doing today. And I want to say it’s reciprocal because we’re doing the same thing in India.
Donald Trump: (25:36)
On Tuesday, two Japanese companies, Toyota and Aisin, announced a combined investment of almost $800 million, which will create over 900 new jobs right here in Texas. At the same time, we are working to expand American exports to India, one of the world’s fastest growing markets. We are committed to ensuring the Indian people have access to the finest goods in the world, product stamped with a beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.” And very soon, India will have access to another world class American product, NBA basketball. Wow, sounds good. That sounds good. Next week thousands of people will gather in Mumbai to watch the first ever NBA basketball game in India. Am I invited, Mr. Prime Minister? I may come. Be careful. I may come.
Donald Trump: (26:55)
When it comes to expanding our commercial relationship, no issue is more important than energy security. For the first time ever, the United States is the number one producer of both oil and natural gas on planet earth and number one by far, with much of it coming right here from the great state of Texas. That means more jobs, higher wages, and lower prices at the pump. Yesterday, we were thrilled to hear about the Indian company Petronas pledge to purchase up to 5 million tons of LNG per year from the United States, which could lead to billions of dollars of LNG exports to India in the coming years. And we have plenty of it. Over the last year, crude exports to India have grown by 400% and liquefied natural gas exports continue to soar at record numbers. Thank you. These tremendous exports not only expand employment in America, but they increase freedom and security for India.
Donald Trump: (28:24)
To keep our nation safe, the United States and India forging an even stronger security partnership. US defense sales to India have also reached $18 billion over the past decade. We make the greatest defense mechanisms and equipment anywhere in the world and India knows that well. We’re looking forward to concluding several new defense deals very soon. There are a lot of them in the works. Here in America, we’re creating the United States Space Force and we’re working closely with India to enhance space cooperation. In November, the United States and India will demonstrate a dramatic progress of our defense relationship, holding the first ever tri-service military exercise between our nations. It’s called Tiger Triumph. Good name, it’s a good name. Very good name. Today, we honor all of the brave American and Indian military service members who work together to safeguard our freedom. We stand proudly in defense of liberty and we are committed to protecting innocent civilians from the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Thank you. Both India and the United States also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders. Since taking office, my administration has launched a far-reaching effort to improve screening and vetting of applications for entry. We are working hard to ensure that those who would threaten our security are denied admission into our country and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like-
Donald Trump: (31:03)
… country, and we are enhancing our vetting efforts like never before, not even close. We’re doing it on a daily basis, and we’ll soon be setting records in every one of the aspects of border security. Border security is vital to the United States. Border security is vital to India. We understand that. We are further taking unprecedented action to finally secure our southern border and stop illegal immigration. I want to thank the president of Mexico, who right now has 27,000 soldiers on our southern border. It’s been incredible what’s taken place in a short period of time. Illegal immigration is deeply unfair to millions of wonderful legal immigrants who work hard, pay their taxes, follow our rules, and obey our laws. Yet there are those in Washington who would raid your healthcare to … Free benefits. They want to fund free benefits to those who enter our country illegally. We don’t want to do that. We don’t want to do that. Because if we don’t do it, they won’t come.
Donald Trump: (32:37)
I will never allow politicians to take away your healthcare or give it to illegal immigrants. My administration believes our first duty is to the highest loyalty of all. We must always be for the American people, whether it’s African-American, Hispanic-American, Indian-American. We are going to take care of our citizens first. We are going to take care of our Indian-American citizens before we take care of illegal immigrants that want to pour into our country. We want to build a nation where every family, immigrant and US-born, can live in a safe community with access to great school, work in a job you love, and have the best chance to reach the American dream. We love the American dream.
Donald Trump: (33:39)
Just in concluding, I want to say that America has always been a nation of pioneers and patriots, risk-takers and free thinkers, and dedicated workers who have honed a trade, mastered their field, and teach their children to always give their very, very best. Every day Indian-Americans help write the story of American greatness, and everyone here today has a crucial part to play in building an even grander and greater American and Indian future.
Donald Trump: (34:25)
To help achieve that exciting vision, we are strengthening our cherished bonds with the nation of India, and we are proving the awesome power of democracy and unlimited potential of free people. Together, we will continue to deepen the ties between our nations. We will honor the faith of dignity of our citizens, and we will achieve incredible advancements for our people, for our children, and for the world. We will discover new cures and save millions of lives. We will advance cutting-edge technologies and lift millions and millions of people out of poverty. We will pioneer new frontiers in space, working together, raising the sights of humanity. We will uphold our values, defend our liberty, and control our destiny. The United States and India will make our nations stronger, our people wealthier, our dreamers bigger, and our future brighter than ever before, and it won’t even be close.
Donald Trump: (35:45)
I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to especially thank a great man and a great leader, the leader of India, Prime Minister Modi, my friend. Thank you. God bless you all. God bless India, and God bless America. Thank you. Thank you. Now I would like to invite onto this stage in front of this incredible group of unbelievable people Prime Minister Modi, who’s going to give us some of his wisdom. His wisdom is indeed great. Thank you all very much. It’s been a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you.

… story. It’s a partisan whistle blower. Shouldn’t even have information. I’ve had conversations with many leaders, they’re always appropriate. I think Scott can tell you that. Always appropriate. At the highest level always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country. I fight so strongly for this country. It’s just another a political hack job. That’s all it is.
Reporters: (00:26)
On that point, did you discuss Joe Biden, his son or his family with the leader?
Donald Trump: (00:30)
It doesn’t matter what I discussed, but I will say this. Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden’s statement, because it was disgraceful, where he talked about billions of dollars that he’s not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor’s taken off the case. So somebody ought to look into that. And you wouldn’t because he’s a Democrat and the fake news doesn’t look into things like that. It’s a disgrace. [crosstalk 00:00:55] But I had a great conversation with numerous people. I don’t even know exactly who you’re talking about, but I had a great conversation with numerous people, numerous leaders, and I always look for the conversation that’s going to help the United States the most. That’s very important.
Reporters: (01:11)
[crosstalk 00:01:11] Do you know the identity of the whistle blower?
Donald Trump: (01:14)
I don’t know the identity of the whistle blower. I just hear it say partisan person, meaning it comes out from another party. But I don’t have any idea. But I can say that it was a totally appropriate conversation. It was actually a beautiful conversation. And this is no different than the press has had a very bad week with Justice Kavanaugh and all of those ridiculous charges and all of the mistakes made at The New York Times and other places. You’ve had a very bad week and this will be better than all of them. This is another one. So keep playing it up because you’re going to look really bad when it falls. I guess I’m about 22 and 0, and I’ll keep it that way.
Reporters: (01:54)
id you mention Joe Biden during the conversation?
Donald Trump: (01:56)
I don’t want to talk about any conversation, [crosstalk 00:01:59] other than just say, great conversation. Totally appropriate conversation. Couldn’t have been better and keep asking questions and build it up as big as possible so you can have a bigger downfall."
"Aug 14, 2019",3:51 P.M. JST,"Donald Trump: (02:31)
Well thank you very much, and thank you Gretchen. It’s great to be back in the incredible Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Great place. And this is my 13th visit to Pennsylvania during my administration, which is more than any other president to this point in the term. And I really love Pennsylvania, I went to school in Pennsylvania. Philadelphia. So we love this state, and I love the unions, and I love the workers. And you know, when I built buildings in New York, I built them exclusively with union, people don’t understand that. I was exclusive.
Donald Trump: (03:13)
And in the last really great election, our election of 2016, you know, we did great with the union workers, great. But we didn’t do good with the leadership. The leadership said, “Well, we’ve always gone Democrat. Let’s keep going that way.” That didn’t work out too well for some of them, I want to tell you. I’ll tell you, and as Gretchen said, this would have never happened without me and us. This would have never happened. So I’m with you. I’m with you. Remember that.
Donald Trump: (03:45)
And remember that Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania has the best numbers they’ve ever had in the history of the state, and that’s for a very good reason. And you know what that reason is? Hello, here I am. And I’m truly honored to be here with the amazing energy workers and construction workers. These are talented people, the craft workers who make America run and who make America proud. We’re proud again. We’re proud again.
Donald Trump: (04:11)
And no one in the world does it better than you, nobody. Nobody does it better. There’s nobody in the world that does it. And we’re unleashing that power again like we’ve never seen before, I will say. And we are doing well, and we’re fighting against a lot of countries that have taken advantage of us for many, many years, but they’re not doing it so much anymore. And in a little period of time, they won’t be doing it at all anymore. They’ve taken advantage of this country.
Donald Trump: (04:48)
Today we celebrate the revolution in American energy that’s helping make our economy the envy of the world. This shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, I did very well here. We did very well. How many points did we win by? Does anybody know? I’ll tell you. Isn’t it, I think 28 points, that’s a lot. That’s against a Democrat … or whatever.
Donald Trump: (05:18)
It’s one of the single biggest construction projects in the nation and it made it possible and was possible by clean, affordable, all American natural gas. Powerful, clean, natural gas. And when the wind stops blowing, it doesn’t make any difference does it? Unlike like those big windmills that destroy everybody’s property values, kill all the birds. Someday the environmentalists are going to tell us what’s going on with that. And then all of a sudden it stops, the wind, and the televisions go off. And your wives and husbands say, “Darling, I want to watch Donald Trump on television tonight, but the wind stopped blowing and I can’t watch, there’s no electricity in the house, Darling.”.
Donald Trump: (06:15)
Now we love natural gas, and we love a lot of other things too. Each of you has taken part in the largest investment in Pennsylvania history. It’s the largest investment in the history of Pennsylvania, in the history of our country, the money that’s being invested in your state right now. With your help, we’re not only unleashing American energy, we’re restoring the glory of American manufacturing, and we are reclaiming our noble heritage as a nation of builders again. A nation of builders.
Donald Trump: (06:55)
I was a good builder, I built it, I love building. In fact, I’m going to take a tour of the site. They said, “Sir, we were going to do it before the speech, but we’re waiting for it to stop raining.” I said, “Don’t worry about the rain. Do we have umbrellas? Don’t worry about the rain.” Umbrellas work very well, especially when they are made in America.
Donald Trump: (07:17)
So I don’t care, but we’re gonna take a tour afterwards. I’m going to speak to some of your union leaders to say, I hope you’re going to support Trump. Okay? And if they don’t vote them the hell out of office because they’re not doing their job, it’s true. Vote them out of office.
Donald Trump: (07:37)
When completed, this facility will transform abundant natural gas, and we have a lot of it, fracked from Pennsylvania wells, which they never would have allowed you to take if I weren’t president. If my opponent won, this would be a lot of nice new structures outside, I guess you would have stopped long ago. You would have stopped construction before it started too much. But I was talking to Gretchen, they would’ve never gotten the approvals to do what’s needed to fuel these plans. That wouldn’t have been good, so probably they wouldn’t have started, but if they would have started, it would have been stopped. But they put it into plastic through a process known as cracking. That raw material will then be shipped all over the country and all over the world to be fashioned into more products stamped with that very beautiful phrase, “Made in the USA.” Right? Made in the USA. Beautiful.
Donald Trump: (08:50)
That is a beautiful phrase. Getting this massive job done right, has required more than 1,500 pieces of heavy equipment, one of the largest cranes anywhere in the world. I look forward to seeing it, I love cranes. I love trucks of all types. Even when I was a little boy at four years old, my mother would say, “You love the trucks.” I do. I always loved trucks, I still do, nothing changes. Sometimes, you know, you might become president, but nothing changes, I still love trucks. Especially when I look at the largest crane in the world, that’s very cool. Do you think I’ll get to operate it? I don’t know. We’ll put the media on it and I’ll give then a little ride. Right?
Donald Trump: (09:46)
And you have thousands of tons of concrete, aluminum, and steel and nearly 6,000 of the strongest, toughest, and most talented workers anywhere on earth. It’s true. I know. It was the Trump administration that made it possible, no one else. Without us, you would never have been able to do this. I want to thank all of our great union members, the boiler makers, carpenters, cement finishers, electricians, iron workers, laborers, millwrights, operators, plumbers, painters, steam fitters, I know them well.
Donald Trump: (10:47)
And a group that I’ve used more than anybody that’s ever run for office times a thousand. Because in New York City they would drive those cement trucks up to my building, and those trucks were always on time, and sometimes they were lined up for six blocks when I was doing different things. Even when I was doing the Wollman Rink the city couldn’t build, it took them nine years, they had no idea what they were doing. And I had that whole, big, about 70,000 feet. It’s like a massive office floor, bigger than an office. Look, we did it all in one day and the trucks were lined up from Central Park all the way back into Harlem. And they did it all in one day.
Donald Trump: (11:32)
That pour, it was called a contiguous pour, the city used to build little pieces, a little piece here, a little piece there, little piece here, little piece there. A few years later, a little piece here. Then they had pipes underneath, and the pipes were made out of copper. And during the evening things would happen, like the copper would be stolen because it was very valuable. So they’d have a little piece with copper and then the rest of the pipe they’d lay and they’d get ready to pour, and they’d leave and everybody would steal the copper. So they’d … this took place for … I guess from seven to nine years, nobody actually knows, nobody wants to talk about it. But those trucks were operated incredibly well and I never missed a delivery and it’s called the teamsters.
Donald Trump: (12:21)
I also wanna thank Bechtel, a real incredible company. We talk about the great builders of the world, President Jack Future. Where is he? Where is he? Jack? Where is Jack? Jack? What a great job you’ve done, Jack. Some big ones. Think of it this way, Jack, if we don’t win, you won’t be doing anything in this country. And you know the world follows us, you see that. The world follows us. And it won’t be so good. But you and I are friends and you’re going to have a lot of work to do, I think Jack, a lot of work. Thank you, Jack. Great job. Jack has done an incredible job. That’s an incredible company. Incredible. They’re incredible builders.
Donald Trump: (13:06)
And the Secretary Treasurer of North America is building trades unions, Brent Booker, where’s Brent? Brent, thank you, great job. Young guy. You’re so young, Brent. How the hell did you get that job? Man.
Donald Trump: (13:22)
We’re honored to be joined by two leaders who truly have the backs of American workers. They’ve become friends of mine, they do such an incredible job. They break up the roadblocks. We have a lot of roadblocks in this country where you have … a little clause can stop a project, a little clause can stop it for years. And we break up those little clauses, we break them up fast. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Where’s Rick? Rick. Thank you, Rick. Another great guy. I had to compete with him. You know, he wanted to be president. He was tough, he was nasty. Man. He was nasty. But then he said, “I want to do something great”, and you have been incredible. He ran Texas for like 14 years. And he did it well and now he’s running a little thing called energy and nobody’s ever done it better. Thank you, Rick, very much. Great job.
Donald Trump: (14:21)
And a man who has been incredible in every way. You know, EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, you’ve heard a lot of horror stories where nothing can get done, nothing gets passed. It takes years, and years, and years to get a simple permit. It can take 20, 21 years to get a road before they reject it. How about this? They go 20 years, 21 years in certain cases for a highway or road, not even a highway. At the end of the 21st year they vote to reject it. How would you like to be, you’re a young person, you’re starting out, and you’re all excited about this project, and it starts off as being a simple straight road. And then it ends up being a total catastrophe. Because of nesting and lots of other things that we can take care of. And it’s 20 years later, and then they reject it. You’ve devoted half of your working life to a rejection. Happened to many people. And we have a man that knows how to break it up, but he’s also a great lover of the environment, EPA Administrator, Andrew Wheeler. He’s done an incredible job. Andrew, great job, Andre. Really great job.
Donald Trump: (15:37)
And I also want to recognize some of my great friends that have helped me so much. Congressman John Joyce. John? John? Where is John? John. John, usually you’re in the front row, I can’t believe this. I guess you got shut out by the unions. Thank you John. Fantastic job, John Joyce. Been a great friend, a great friend of all of us.
Donald Trump: (16:03)
Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Michael Turzai. Michael Turzai. Thank you, Michael, great job. Thank you. Good to see you, Michael. Michael Turzai. Great name in this state, I’ll tell you, for a long time. How long has it been, Michael, you’ve been there a long time. How long? Okay, good luck. Not that long. Thank you Mike.
Donald Trump: (16:31)
And one of my good friends from Beaver County, David Urban. David. David, where’s David? David, thank you, David. Great football player, great athlete. And he was a Trump supporter, he liked Trump. And when he liked Trump, nobody was going to get in his way. Right, David? Thank you. Thank you. How are we doing in this state, David? We looking good? Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you. I think we’re looking very good. I think we’re looking good all over in Ohio, in North Carolina and South Carolina, Florida. We just got numbers in Florida. We’re looking fantastically good.
Donald Trump: (17:16)
Now, you know, sometimes … And they do, they do, they say “Donald Trump”. Can you imagine if I got a fair press? I mean, we’re leading without it, can you imagine if these people treated me fairly? The election would be over. Have they ever called off an election before? Just said, “Look, just … let’s go, go on, four more years.”
Donald Trump: (17:37)
Yeah. And then you want to really drive them crazy, go to hashtag third term, hashtag fourth term. You’ll drive them totally crazy. I mean, you have one guy on television, I’m telling you he’s not leaving. He’s going to win. And then he’s not leaving. So in 2024 he won’t leave, I’m telling you, this is a serious person. These people have gone stone cold crazy.
Donald Trump: (18:07)
And we’re grateful, especially to chairman of Royal Dutch Shell. That’s big stuff, folks. You know, I’m a business guy, When I hear Royal Dutch Shell, until I became president, that was like a big deal. But now I don’t feel it the same. Once you’re president, nothing seems big. Right? Chad Holiday. Where’s Chad? Chad understands. That’s a big deal, Chad. And thank you for coming. That’s a big deal. You don’t get any bigger. It’s an incredible company.
Donald Trump: (18:39)
Shell’s US president, you just met her and you know her, everybody knows her. And she’s got a lot of other things in store, and she’s thanked me for what we’ve done here, but I said, “Forget this. We’ve got a lot of jobs. Let’s do a couple of more fast. Do them fast, we’ll get your fast approvals,” and you may get rejected. You know, if it’s not going to be environmentally good, environmentally sound, if something’s going to be wrong, but we’re not going to take 20 years to reject you like they did with the pipelines. Doesn’t matter, I approved them, but that’s okay. So we have pipe … Oh. We’ve got plenty of pipeline folks here, don’t we? Ah, I’d say.
Donald Trump: (19:21)
Hey. You know, that’s a bigger hand than we got from the Teamsters, you believe that? Now, but you know they did that with the pipelines, right? Keystone XL, they did it with the pipelines. Dakota Access Pipeline, we’re building pipelines, and if we get the pipelines approved then you better work. The EPA is working right now to get them approved and Texas said, “If we can do, we can increase our … we can increase,” we’re now the largest in the world in energy by far.
Donald Trump: (19:52)
But if we get those approved, Andrew, I hope Andrew’s listening, EPA, Andrew, you know what I’m saying, right? If we get them approved in Texas fast, they said it will take 18 years. I said, “Could you do it in about a month?” If we get the … Oh look at those pipeline guys, they’re so happy. That’s a lot of jobs. But Andrew, if we get them approved fast, we can increase our entire output. Texas is so big and is bigger, it turned out to be much bigger. I also got you ANWR in Alaska, which may be bigger than everything. And they couldn’t get it. Ronald Reagan couldn’t get it, no president could get it, and I got it approved and we’re all set. And so Andrew in Texas, if you can get those pipelines going, you will be so happy. We’ll have dinner with your family. I’ll tell them how great you were. Okay, EPA. Thank you, Andrew.
Donald Trump: (20:50)
So I want to … I want to thank though Gretchen, she’s been fantastic. I also want to thank Vice President of Pennsylvania Chemicals, Hillary Mercer. I want to thank you very much for investing in the people of Pennsylvania. Hillary? Where’s Hillary? Thank you, Hillary. You’re investing in the people of Pennsylvania, so that’s a guarantee, as far as I’m concerned.
Donald Trump: (21:15)
[inaudible 00:21:15] America greatness was forged and fueled and won by the extraordinary workers of this region. This region is an incredible region. Pennsylvania steel raised the skyscrapers that built our cities, and by the way, steel, steel was dead. Your business was dead. Okay? I don’t want to be overly crude. Your business was dead. And I put a little thing called a 25% tariff on all of the dump steel all over the country, and now your business is thriving. Probably there’s few businesses that have gone proportionately up like steel and aluminum. We did it with aluminum too, but they are doing well, 25% and 10% on aluminum.
Donald Trump: (22:02)
… doing well, 25% and 10% on aluminum, and they still dump, but now the United States takes in billions of dollars, and the dumping is much less, and the steel companies are thriving again. We have to have a steel industry. We need steel for defense. What are we going to do? We have a little bit of a problem. We have a little bit of a conflict. We’ll say, “Listen, China, could you do us a favor? We need to help. All our steel mills are closed, Oh, dammit. Could you send us some steel, please? We don’t make seal anymore.”.
Donald Trump: (22:41)
Well, we make it now, and I’ll tell you what, those steel mills, US Steel and all of them, all of them, they’re expanding all over the place. New mills, new expansions. We didn’t have a new mill built in 30 years, and now we have many of them going up. Many car plants, they’re coming in from Japan. I told Prime Minister Abe, great guy. I said, listen, we have a massive deficit with Japan. They send thousands and thousands, millions of cars, we send them wheat. Wheat. That’s not a good deal.
Donald Trump: (23:18)
And they don’t even want our wheat. They do it because they want us to at least feel that we’re okay. You know, they do it to make us feel good, but the deficit is massive, which changing rapidly. But what they’re doing is they’re buying a lot of our stuff, including our military equipment. They are building car plants now in the United States, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, many, many of the Japanese car companies are coming over and building car plants in the United States. It doesn’t fully do the trip, but it helps. And those deficits will start coming down very substantially, but we’re losing 78 billion. For many years, we’re losing billions and billions with these countries, and frankly, the countries that we do the worst with are the allies, our allies. Does that make sense to you? Our allies take advantage of us far greater than our enemies, and someday I’m going to explain that to a lot of people.
Donald Trump: (24:14)
Pennsylvania miners. Do we love our miners? They lit up our towns and powered our industries, and Pennsylvania factory workers made the American brand into the universal symbol of excellence all around the world, all over. But in recent decades, the loyalty of Pennsylvania workers was repaid only with betrayal. They betrayed you. They let your companies move to Mexico, to Canada, to China, to many other places. We ended up with no income and massive unemployment. Well, right now our employment has reached the lowest level that it’s seen since the 1960s and we’ll soon be breaking that record, I predict.
Donald Trump: (25:04)
And you’ve heard me say it, but now it’s even better. Numbers just came out. African American unemployment, lowest in history, Asian American, Hispanic American, lowest in the history of our country. Women lowest in 70 years. Sorry women, I let you down again. Think of it, lowest in 70 years, and I have to apologize to women, but soon we’re going to have that. That will be a record very soon. We’re very close to saying lowest in history for women unemployment. Today we have more workers working in the United States, almost 160 million, than at any time in the history of our country. Think of that. That’s a hell of a stat. The political class in Washington gutted your factories with horrendous trade deals, horrible. NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever. By the way, World Trade Organization, it made China, China made themselves, they did a good job, but they ripped off our country for years, and with our money and World Trade Organization backing, and then they took advantage of the rules of the World Trade Organization, and I’m being nice when I say took advantage. Much more than took advantage.
Donald Trump: (26:34)
They went up like a rocket ship. They were flat lined for a hundred years, and then one day World Trade Organization, a terrible move, and we were losing all our cases until I came along. We were losing all our cases in the World Trade Organization. Almost every case were lost, lost, lost. They thought we were stupid. They were the ones ruling. And then I came along. Now we’re winning a lot of cases, because they know that they’re not on very solid ground. We will leave if we have to, and all of a sudden we’re winning a lot of cases. We’re winning most of our cases, and it’s only because of attitude, because we know that they have been screwing us for years, and it’s not going to happen any longer. They get it, they get it. So they’re giving us victories. They’re giving us victories.
Donald Trump: (27:27)
I’d like to use a different word, but there’s no word that’s quite as … Right? There’s no word that’s quite as descriptive. I’d like to, but that’s exactly what they were doing. They were taking advantage of us for years and years, and now they understand that if it’s not going to be fair, it’s not going to be at all. We don’t need it, we don’t need it. So a lot of good things, and I think we will, I think they will treat us fairly. I mean the concept should work, but people have taken advantage. Like for instance, they view certain countries like China, India, many countries for a long time, they viewed them as they’re growing, right? They’re growing nations. We’re a mature nation. They’re growing. These are growing nations. Well, they’ve grown, and they had tremendous advantages, but we’re not letting that happen anymore, okay? We’re not letting that happen anymore.
Donald Trump: (28:19)
Everybody’s growing but us. They’re all growing nations. We have to work with them, but nobody ever wants to work with the United States. It’s a disgrace. But it’s changing, and it’s changing fast, and I think it’s the primary reason probably that I ran for president. I’d see these factories all over the country, and I’d see them empty, and I’d see the jobs going to other countries, and I just never understood why the politicians didn’t do anything about it. But now we’re doing it. And by the way, the USMCA, that’s Mexico and Canada, that deal is a fantastic deal, and it’s a great deal for your unions, too. We have the farmers, the unions, the manufacturers. It’s good for everybody. We have to get the Democrats to put it up for a vote, and most Democrats are going to vote for it, too. They’re under a lot of pressure to vote for it, but that replaces one of the worst trade deals ever made, which is NAFTA.
Donald Trump: (29:09)
But I watched them crush your industries with taxes and regulations, and they targeted American energy for total destruction. You weren’t going to be able to take anything out. That’s our gold. That’s gold underneath their feet, and they weren’t going to allow it to happen. The Paris Accord, the Paris Accord was good for other countries, wasn’t good for us. All the while they expected you to stay on the sidelines, silence your voices, and surrender the future of our nation, and you didn’t do it, but you didn’t have the right people representing you, so it didn’t matter. But when you finally had the right person, the person that really cared … This thing is costing me a fortune, being president. Somebody said, “Oh, he might’ve rented a room to a man from Saudi Arabia for $500.” What about the 5 billion that I’ll lose?
Donald Trump: (30:02)
It’s probably gonna cost me, including upside downside lawyers, because every day they sue me for something. These are the most litigious people. It’s probably costing me from three to 5 billion for the privilege of being, and I couldn’t care less. I don’t care. You know, if you’re wealthy, it doesn’t matter. I just want to do a great job. That’s why I don’t care. I want to do the right job. When this great building company comes here, wants to build a plant, I want to make it easy for them, not hard for them. I’m not jealous of them. I couldn’t care less, [Bechtel 00:00:30:36]. I’m not jealous of them.
Donald Trump: (30:43)
I got sued on a thing called emoluments. Emoluments, you ever hear the word? Nobody ever heard of it before. They went back. Now nobody looks at Obama getting $60 million for a book. That’s okay, even though nobody in history ever got that much money for a book. Obama got 60. Think of it, $60 million for a book. But with me, it’s everything. Emoluments. Nobody knows what it is. Here’s the good news. Last month I just won two cases on emoluments, and the judge was scolding of the other side. And what it is, is presidential harassment, because this thing is costing me a fortune and I love it. Okay? I love it because I’m making the lives of other people much, much better.
Donald Trump: (31:41)
Each of you here today is living proof that America never surrenders. We don’t surrender. And we were in bad shape. This area was in really bad shape, and now you look outside and you say, that’s like the eighth wonder of the world. Under my administration, we’re fighting back, and we’re winning because we are truly and finally putting America first. After years of building up foreign countries, we are finally building up our country. Think of it, we protect the border of South Korea, but we don’t protect our own border. But now we are and the wall is being built. We won that case two weeks ago. We won that case. The wall is being … We’re going to have a lot of it. We’re going to have anywhere from 400 to 500 miles built by the end of next year. We’re building a lot of wall, and we need it. We need it. We want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally, and we want them to come in through merit. The last administration tried to shut down Pennsylvania coal and Pennsylvania fracking. If they got in, your fracking is gone. Your coal is gone. You guys, I don’t know what the hell you going to do. You don’t want to make widgets, right? Do you want to learn how to make a computer, a little tiny piece of stuff you put it with those big, beautiful hands of yours?
Donald Trump: (33:21)
Take these big hands, he’s going to take this little tiny part. He’s going to go home. “Alice, this is a tough job.” No, you want to make steel, and you want to dig coal, and that’s what you want to do. I was in West Virginia when Hillary made that terrible statement that she wants to close up all of the coal. She forgot in three weeks she was going to West Virginia. Remember, she wanted to close up all coal. She was in an area where they didn’t do the coal, and she said, “I look forward to closing up all coal. It’s going to be closed. Steel is going to be in big trouble.” She forgot, three weeks she was going to West Virginia. That didn’t work out. I want that one by 42 points, 42 points, West Virginia.
Donald Trump: (34:11)
I actually think this time we have a good chance of winning Virginia, which is a tough one to win, because you know you have some people there that maybe don’t agree with us, but I think we have a really good chance of Virginia, too, which is something that hasn’t been won by a Republican in a long time. But it’s common sense, and a lot of this is, you know, they say politics, politics, great politics is common sense. But on my first day in office, I ended the war on American energy, and that’s common sense, I think. That’s common sense. We’re lucky. You go to places like China, they don’t have oil and gas. They don’t have it under there. They have to go buy it, and then they devalue their currency and manipulate their currency, and that’s cost them a fortune to go out and buy it.
Donald Trump: (34:58)
They hurt themselves in the long run, but they’re devaluing all over the place as others are. But we have this unbelievable, the greatest in the world. We have the greatest resources, which really came about over the last few years. Nobody knew this. Fracking made it possible. Other new technologies made it possible, and now we’re the number one. Think of it, as I said, the number one energy producer in the world. I’m so proud of that, because we wouldn’t have been number five. They were going to close it up. They were going to close it up, and it’s common sense. They wanted to take away our wealth. That’s what the Paris Accord would have done, would have taken away our wealth. It wasn’t for us. It was good for others. It wasn’t for us. We had to pay money to other countries that are very substantial countries. They wanted to take away your wealth. They didn’t want you to drill. They didn’t want you to frack. They didn’t want you to do steel. They wanted to take away your wealth. . Now the press will try and spin that differently, but I’m right.
Donald Trump: (35:55)
The fake news. That’s a lot of people back there for, for 11 o’clock speeches. That’s a lot of people. It’s like the Academy Awards during the day. It used to be. The Academy Awards is on hard times now. You know that. Nobody wants to watch it. You know why? Because they started taking us on. Everyone got tired of it. It’s amazing. That used to be second after the Super Bowl, and then all of a sudden, now it’s just another show, because people got tired of people getting up and making fools of themselves and disrespecting the people in this room and the people that won the election in 2016.
Donald Trump: (36:44)
And the people that won the Senate without me on the ticket in 2018, they never say that. We won the Senate. That’s why we’ll have appointed within two months 179 federal judges and two Supreme Court judges. Think of that. 179. But they don’t say we want the Senate. They say we lost the House, and you know, there are a lot of people running for the house. It’s hard for me to campaign, but almost everybody I campaigned for won. We had tremendous records in ’18, and I wasn’t running. There’s a big difference. In 2020 we’re running, so you better get out there and make sure we win.
Donald Trump: (37:28)
We have a record that nobody’s ever had. Remember when I was running, I was saying, “We’re going to do this. We’re going to create jobs.” Everyone, big yawn. You know, we like him. Let’s give him a shot. What do we have to lose, right? I said that with African Americans, they had the worst crime rates, the worst education, the worst everything. They had like 10 things. I’m reading it off a list. I looked, I said, “What the hell do you have to lose?” But I really sort of said the same thing to everybody, because our country wasn’t doing well with Biden and Obama, wasn’t doing well, and they were pouring money in, pouring, pouring money in, and it wasn’t doing well. Even now, you see the interest rates, I’m paying a normalized interest rate. We should be paying less, frankly.
Donald Trump: (38:14)
This guy’s made a big mistake. He’s made a big mistake. The head of the Fed. That was another beauty that I chose, but even with that, we’re paying a normalized interest rate. The nice thing is you get some interest from the bank. With President Obama, he was paying nothing. It’s easy to make money when you’re paying nothing. You’re paying zero. Easy. But even with that, our economy’s roaring, and his wasn’t. It was the weakest economy since the Great Depression, the weakest up. So we have it going. Our country now has the hottest economy anywhere in the world.
Donald Trump: (38:49)
Every time a prime minister, president, king, queen, dictator, whatever they may be. Some are sort of mutual. Some you have presidents and prime ministers who are actually dictators, but they come in and they see me at the Oval Office. They always say, almost everybody, congratulations on your incredible economy. What you’ve done is incredible. The tax cuts, the regulation cuts, all of the things we’ve done, and they’re all saying that they want to try and copy us. It’s not easy to copy us. A part of the reason it’s not easy is because of the people like this all over the country, the people in this room. You are incredible people. That was an incredible [inaudible 00:17:28]. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (39:28)
Incredible people. Incredible people. And here in the Appalachian region where the Marcellus and Utica shale formations generate one third of American natural gas, think of that. You’ve been sitting on this for a long time, and yet look at the numbers. Look at the way you lived, because you never had anybody that wanted to take advantage of it, but now we’re taking advantage of it. You’re sitting on gold, and we’re taking advantage of it, and your future has never looked brighter or better. It’s so great that you stayed, because you suffered. This whole region, Appalachia. It just suffered, this whole region, with great people, the greatest people, and you suffered.
Donald Trump: (40:16)
When this plant opens, 600 American workers will get the full time jobs with quality healthcare, pensions, and great pay to support a family, and you have, I said before, almost 2000 construction workers, and you’re going to another plant, because we’re going to talk to Bechtel after this, and we’re talking to Shell. When you got the boss from Shell, you people don’t realize, that’s a big deal. I don’t know where the hell he comes from. Where are you based? It’s not in this country. Hey, how about moving Shell to the United States?
Donald Trump: (40:58)
We’re ready if you are. Just let me know. But they have their big USA division, but that that’s a great company. It’s a big deal, and that you’re here is a big deal. That’s a big deal to me, and it’s a big deal to everybody in this room. You have the top man, top man at Shell. But this is just the beginning. My administration is clearly the way for other massive multibillion dollar investments. We just did one in Louisiana. It’s a $10 billion plant. There’s more pipes in that plant that I’ve ever seen in my life. There’s more plant. You know that. LNG, it’s an LNG plant, $10 billion, and it’s totally sold out. They sell it like you rent office space. Can you believe it? It’s all sold out.
Donald Trump: (41:47)
All over the world, people have used it, and you haven’t had a plant like that built in this country really ever, because there’s never been anything that big, but you didn’t build plants like that, because environmentally they weren’t letting you. And yet environmentally it’s so good what they’ve done and what they can build today. Investments that could bring more than 100,000 new jobs to this region are now being looked at very seriously, and I think the hundred thousand dollars, I really do, I feel the 100,000 jobs, Andrew, is going to be a very low number. I think you’re going to have many more. This is an incredible region. You’re sitting on top of something special. It’s all fueled by the greatest treasure on the planet, American energy, and we don’t want people taking that away from us. Two more companies have recently proposed a $10 billion investment in the great state of Ohio, incredible state.
Donald Trump: (42:49)
We have tens of billions of dollars’ worth of investments, and this is really good stuff that we’re now negotiating, but these two are in Ohio. The energy revolution is also creating new jobs in West Virginia, Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Kansas, Louisiana, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, all across our beautiful land. You have no idea what’s going on, including, as I said before, car companies. We didn’t make cars. Look, we lost 32% of our car companies to Mexico, before I got there, by the way. Now it’s very, very hard to do that anymore. Nobody’s going to be looking that way, I don’t think. And I want to thank Mexico, because the president now has been great, and he’s got 27,000 soldiers on our Southern border and on his border with Guatemala, keeping our borders safe. Our numbers are plummeting, the people coming in, all because the Democrats won’t approve fixing the loopholes of asylum. So I want to thank Mexico. It’s incredible. We have close-
Donald Trump: (44:03)
I want to thank Mexico. It’s incredible. We have close to 27,000. Think of that. We never had three. I think we had about two and a half soldiers. One was sitting down all the time. We had nobody.
Donald Trump: (44:17)
And don’t forget, the southern border is 2,000 miles from the Gulf to the Pacific. We have 27,000, and they’re doing a great job. They’re helping themselves, too, because they’re disrupting and really hurting the cartels. So much of that stuff is run illegally by the cartels, human trafficking, drugs, people. It’s terrible.
Donald Trump: (44:36)
Mexico, I’ll tell you, they are so far… I hope they’re going to keep it up. I hope they’re going to keep it up. But they’ve been great, and 27,000 people. They wouldn’t have done that for any other president. That I can tell you. That I can tell you.
Donald Trump: (44:48)
With us today are a few of the hardworking Pennsylvania patriots who are making this comeback possible.
Donald Trump: (44:56)
Jason Eckhart is the third generation of his family to work on these grounds, and he’s doing better than any of them. By the way, three years ago, you wouldn’t have said that. Three years ago, his father would say, “Hey, I had it made.” His grandparents would say, “We had it made.” Now he can look at them and say, “Dad, we have it made.”.
Donald Trump: (45:20)
His father and grandfather worked for the zinc smelting company previously housed at this site. When that plant closed in 2014, 500 jobs disappeared, like magic. Remember President Obama, “You need magic to bring back manufacturing jobs. You need a magic wand.” Do you remember? “Not going to happen.” Well, so far, we’ve brought back 600,000 manufacturing jobs.
Donald Trump: (45:51)
Jason never imagined he would get the chance to carry on his family’s legacy, but now he has. He is carrying it on, and he’s carrying it on proudly. He’s a great American. Jason? Where are you, Jason? Jason? Jason? Come on up, Jason. Come on, let’s get Jason up. Come on up. Jason. I’d like Jason to tell us what this great facility means to him and to his family. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (46:21)
Thank you, Jason.
Jason Eckhart: (46:30)
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.
Jason Eckhart: (46:38)
It’s been amazing to see the transformation on this site from a 100-year-old zinc smelter to a state-of-the-art petrochem facility. I’m very proud to be part of Pennsylvania Chemicals, to redevelop this site, and create the jobs in Western Pennsylvania for all of you.
Jason Eckhart: (47:01)
It’s very exciting to think about what we have to come, starting this place up and having jobs into the future for our families. As a native from this area, I’m from right here in Center Township, I can appreciate how much this means to the area. I’m really proud to be part of this and be proud of all you guys. Thanks.
Donald Trump: (47:24)
Thank you, Jason. Great. Did you enjoy doing that, Jason? I think so. You had a big group of people back here that likes you a lot. They’re giving him a hard time back there, his friends. Thanks, Jason.
Donald Trump: (47:44)
Heather Michaux grew up here in Beaver County, and has been working for Shell in other states for several years. Now she can raise her family right near her parents and loved ones, and actually be home, where she wants to be and where she belongs. Heather, please come up and tell us about your journey.
Heather Michaux: (48:06)
Thank you, Mr. President.
Donald Trump: (48:20)
Thank you.
Heather Michaux: (48:21)
For me, when Shell announced that we were going to be building a facility in Beaver County, I was in Texas, and I was so excited, but not just for me getting to further my career and move home; I was excited for all the possibilities that had opened up for my hometown. I was excited because I recognized the potential that a place like this has, for us to be able to hone our existing skills and to gain new ones too.
Heather Michaux: (48:46)
I knew that we, the hardworking people of Western Pennsylvania, and other places in the U.S. too, would now have this fresh opportunity and would take advantage of it. And that’s the opportunity that I see the thousands of you folks taking advantage of now, not only today, but we’re also creating something that is going to well outlive us by building this site. And I am really proud to be a part of that legacy, sir.
Donald Trump: (49:10)
Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. She’ll be running for office soon. Fantastic job.
Donald Trump: (49:27)
Samantha Polizotto was a single mom working full-time when she learned about process technology training programs at the local community college, funded by Shell. She became the first woman to graduate from that program, and she made the Dean’s List. That’s pretty good. Now she’s leading the way as one of the very first production operators hired here at Shell.
Donald Trump: (49:55)
Samantha, please come up and say a few words. Please.
Samantha P.: (49:58)
Growing up in Beaver County, I can recall people talking of the good old days when steel mills were running and, often, people were born and spent their whole lives in the same town. Local families had multiple generations working the same industry and, in many cases, the same companies. This was a fact for our parents, but with the fall of the steel mills in this area, it began to see a period of stagnation. Hardworking men and women in this area, full of pride, still lace up their work boots, driving by the vacant skeletons of the old mills and refineries, holding onto the hope that one day this area would see its former glory.
Samantha P.: (50:50)
The announcement of Shell Pennsylvania Chemicals Plant seems to have kindled that spark within the community. It has provided an opportunity for steady employment for many different skilled tradesmen, emptying many of the local union halls.
Samantha P.: (51:04)
As a young woman, this has also afforded me an incredible opportunity to come into the ground floor of an unprecedented project. In school, I chose a field far different than many of my female colleagues. Process technology is a focused area of studies around production and operations.
Samantha P.: (51:24)
Predominantly male-dominated careers, I knew there would be challenges as I entered the workforce. Being a mother and a wife, I must balance my responsibilities at work and at home. The challenges I have faced have been softened by a network of support that has been given to me not only by my family, but also through the Community College of Beaver County, my coworkers, and now the culture of care at Shell. I am proud to play a role in this project, as it restores this area and makes Beaver County great again.
Donald Trump: (52:09)
Thank you, Samantha. That was a great job. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (52:12)
To help create more opportunities for workers like Jason, Heather, and Samantha, my administration started the Pledge to America’s Workers. Our partners are providing over 12 million training and enhanced career opportunities to American workers. My daughter Ivanka is working so hard on it. She’s done a great job. Twelve million people, so far, have been positively affected.
Donald Trump: (52:35)
Today, I’m pleased to announce that Shell is signing the Pledge to America’s Workers to provide enhanced career opportunities. By the way, Shell, thank you. They’re providing career opportunities to 3,300 workers over five years, right here in Western Pennsylvania. That’s great. Thank you, fellas. Thank you very much. And thank you, Hilary, for the tremendous commitment that you’ve made. We really appreciate it. Fantastic job.
Donald Trump: (53:11)
Under this administration, we live by two very simple words, Buy American. That’s what we want. I’m going to add something. Hire American. It’s about hiring American, buying American. It’s about America First. It’s about Make America Great Again. It’s about Keep America Great.
Donald Trump: (53:40)
Despite all of this exceptional progress, however, some politicians in this country still want to keep America’s vast energy treasures buried deep underground, let other nations take advantage of our country. Not happening anymore. They see factories like this one not as a cause for celebration, but for condemnation. Democrats in Congress are pushing hard for the Green New Deal. How about that one? Green New Deal.
Audience: (54:08)
Boo.
Donald Trump: (54:11)
Where it puts everybody in this room out of work, hate to tell you, and a lot more people. Everybody out of work. But I don’t want to speak badly about it. You know, you’ve heard me say this. I want to encourage them. That should be their platform.
Donald Trump: (54:26)
I don’t want to do it too early. I did it very early with Pocahontas. I should have probably waited. She’s staging a comeback on Sleepy Joe. I don’t know who’s going to win, but we’ll have to hit Pocahontas very hard again if she does win. But she’s staging a little bit of a comeback. What a group, Pocahontas and Sleepy Joe. I don’t think they give a damn about Western Pennsylvania, do you?
Audience: (54:53)
No.
Donald Trump: (54:54)
I don’t think so. And other radical plans to wipe out our coal. That’s what they want. They want to wipe out our oil. They want to wipe out our natural gas industries, while allowing other countries to steal our jobs. Virtually every leading Democrat has vowed to eliminate fossil fuels, obliterating millions of American jobs, devastating communities, and bankrupting factories, families, and senior citizens all across this region.
Donald Trump: (55:25)
By the way, this is the only fuel that has the power for plants. When you have to steam up and you have to fuel up on these giant plants, these giant generators, these giant electrical factories, you need what you’re doing. You need this. It’s got the power. The other doesn’t have the power, certainly not yet, probably never will.
Donald Trump: (55:53)
We’re not taking chances. We have the cleanest air and water we’ve ever had in our country right now, the cleanest we’ve ever had, and we’re going to keep it that way.
Donald Trump: (56:07)
We’re never going to allow other countries and outside sources to take away our great wealth, because that’s what they want to do. They want to take away our wealth, take away our jobs. We’re not going to let it happen.
Donald Trump: (56:22)
To see the destructive results of the far-left’s energy nightmare, just compare the enormous success here in Pennsylvania with the tremendous folly happening right across a line, a little line, in New York. Both states have vast energy reserves, but New York prohibits development while Pennsylvania welcomes it.
Donald Trump: (56:45)
From 2010 to 2017, natural gas production plummeted by nearly 70% in New York, but it soared almost 1000% percent in Pennsylvania. And New York won’t allow us to build a pipeline across, because New York is sort of a long state, and we can’t have pipelines going across, helping a region that’s not a wealthy region at all. They have a lot of economic problems. People are leaving left and right.
Donald Trump: (57:16)
We want to get it over to the waters. We want to get it over to the oceans. We want to get it up to New England, where they have the highest energy costs anywhere in the United States. We can’t get energy because New York doesn’t allow the pipelines to go through. That’s going to be very costly for New York, ultimately.
Donald Trump: (57:35)
As a result, families in Pennsylvania shale country got more jobs, billions of dollars in royalty payments, and wages that are significantly higher compared to their neighbors just across the state line. Meanwhile, families in New York… I love New York. that’s where I’m from. Probably most of you don’t know that. That’s where I’m from. They’re burdened with more power outages and electricity rates, you never saw anything like this, that are much, much higher than neighboring states and than your state.
Donald Trump: (58:12)
New York energy rates are through the roof. New England, through the roof. A lot of it has to do with the fact that we can’t get pipelines through New York. New York won’t let us. They won’t let us.
Donald Trump: (58:24)
All New York likes to do is sue me. They like to sue me. They’re always suing. I said, “Which lawyer is handling that case?” No, they sue me for everything so they can try to stop us by any means possible.
Donald Trump: (58:40)
The radical Left wants to do to America what they’ve done to New York, raise prices, kill jobs, and leave our nation less independent and far less secure. My vision is the exact opposite. We want to work with New York, and we want to help New York. They need jobs in New York so badly. You know, they talk about the environment. So you have the state line, and over here you have machinery fracking. And over here you have nothing, except poverty. Over here you have people driving new cars and nice cars, and over here you have cars that are 40 years old. Now, what does that have to do with the environment? It’s the same. It’s an artificial line.
Donald Trump: (59:25)
I wonder what happens when they get down there. What happens? I just wonder, is New York losing its wealth? You know what I’m talking about, right? What happens when those lines go down and they can go in any direction now? The equipment is so incredible.
Donald Trump: (59:41)
Hopefully, we can help New York. I want to help New York so much. We will never allow ourselves to be at the mercy of foreign energy suppliers. That’s what’s fighting us. They don’t want us to have great energy. They’ve made a fortune selling us energy.
Donald Trump: (59:55)
You probably saw the Straits the other day. Very few American boats are there. They capture. Iran, I broke up that deal. That was a good thing to do. It’s a whole different country right now.
Donald Trump: (01:00:11)
They’re capturing boats from other countries. They’re not taking our boats. One of the things that was brought up by the media, actually, and wisely and correctly brought out, we have very few boats going there anymore because we have our own oil and gas. We don’t need it from the Middle East anymore. That’s why we’re pursuing a future not only of energy independence… but not just words. You know, you’ve been hearing energy independence for years and years, and you’d hear it. We have real independence. But what we want now is not independence; we want American energy dominance. Dominance.
Donald Trump: (01:00:55)
Instead of relying on foreign countries, we are now relying on American producers, and we are relying on American workers to build our own future right here on American soil. It’s time.
Donald Trump: (01:01:12)
Together, we’re defending the oil and gas workers who light up our cities and uplift our communities. We’re fighting for the technicians and construction workers here in Beaver County who are building a powerful engine of American commerce. There’s no place like what you’re seeing right outside these doors. There is no place like it.
Donald Trump: (01:01:35)
We’re here once again to stand up for the engineers and the factory workers who will shape the work of your hands into American-made products sold all over the world. That’s what’s going to happen. That’s what you’re producing.
Donald Trump: (01:01:51)
And everyday patriots who make this all possible, you are the backbone of America, the absolute backbone, and you haven’t been given the honor of having that said by other people. But you are the backbone of this country. So true.
Donald Trump: (01:02:17)
You are the ones who work hard, pay your taxes, build your neighborhoods, obey our laws, safeguard our values, raise up your children, make this land the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth. You are the ones who do it. We work with a lot of people, but you are there and you are doing it. You’ve always been loyal to America, and now you finally have a president of the United States who is loyal to you.
Donald Trump: (01:02:53)
Our vision is pro-worker, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-growth, pro-energy, and 100% pro-American. We’re taking care of our military, and we’re taking care of our vets. Veterans Choice, you’ve been hearing it about for 45 years. I got it approved. Veterans Choice. We’re taking care of our veterans. We’re taking care of our military like never, ever before. Because Americans can do anything, go anywhere, and outperform anyone. Nobody can beat us. Nothing can stop us, because winning is what Americans do. Winning is what we know best. We will keep winning, wining, winning.
Donald Trump: (01:03:55)
I used to tell you the story about winning. I used to say that your great leaders would come to Washington and they would say, “President, we’re winning too much. We can’t take it anymore. The people of Pennsylvania cannot stand winning. We haven’t won for years and years, and now we’re winning too much. Mr. President, please, for the good of the people of Pennsylvania, stop winning. Stop creating all these jobs. Stop creating all this product. Please, sir. Please, stop winning.”.
Donald Trump: (01:04:31)
I said to them, and I will say to them, “We’re never going to stop winning because nobody has ever won like what’s happened over the last couple of years. Nobody has ever won like you’re winning.” I’ve more than fulfilled my promises. Even they said, “He promised things, and he actually produced more than he promised.” That’s true. But we’re going to produce more and more.
Donald Trump: (01:04:56)
I just want to thank everybody. With your help, factory floors across this land are once more crackling with life. Our steel mills are fired up and blazing bright. The assembly lines are roaring. Industry is booming. And the hearts of our workers, the American spirit, is soaring higher, stronger, freer, and greater than ever before.
Donald Trump: (01:05:24)
I want to thank you all for giving this nation your very best, and your very best cannot be beaten. I want to thank you for filling America with pride. We are proud of you. We think you are just incredible, incredible people. It’s an honor for me to be with you in Pennsylvania.
Donald Trump: (01:05:43)
Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless you.
Speaker 1: (01:05:46)
(singing)
Speaker 2: (01:05:57)
All right, everybody. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for watching News Now, which is a part of Fox 10-"
"Jul 31, 2019",12:10 P.M. EDT,"Donald Trump: (00:00)
It’s a true privilege to be back in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia. And, it’s a tremendous honor to stand on these historic grounds as the first President to address a joint session of the oldest lawmaking body in all of the Western Hemisphere, the Virginia General Assembly. Congratulations.
Donald Trump: (00:33)
On this day 400 years ago, here on the shores of the James River, the first representative legislative assembly in the new world convened. By the devotion of generations of patriots, it has flourished throughout the ages, and now that proud tradition continues with all of you.
Donald Trump: (00:57)
To every Virginian, and every legislator with us today, congratulations on four incredible centuries of history, heritage, and commitment to the righteous cause of American self-government. This is truly a momentous occasion.
Donald Trump: (01:26)
I want to thank the governor of Virginia for inviting me to speak at this very important event, and with us this morning, our many distinguished guests and officials from across the Commonwealth, including Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (01:48)
Speaker, Kirk Cox. Thank you, Kirk. Thank you. Thank you, Kirk.
Donald Trump: (01:56)
Senate Majority Leader, Tommy Norment. Thank you. Thank you. Tommy. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (02:07)
And members of the host, and other federal, state, local and tribal leaders, all with us today. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (02:22)
We’re also very thankful as well to have with us Secretary Ben Carson. Ben, thank you very much. Wherever you may be. Thank you, Ben.
Donald Trump: (02:34)
And Acting Director, a person that you know very well, Acting Director Ken Cuccinelli. Spent a lot of time with you, folks, and has a lot of respect for you.
Donald Trump: (02:48)
And the terrific people at the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service. I want to thank you all for being here with us. It’s a great honor.
Donald Trump: (03:00)
I also want to recognize everyone at American Evolution and the Jamestown Settlement, the Jamestown-Yorktown Foundation, the Jamestown Rediscovery Project and Preservation Virginia. Thank you very much. What a great job you do. Thank you.
Donald Trump: (03:23)
The fact is that each of you has helped protect and preserve our national treasures here at Jamestown, and it’s a great debt. We owe you a great, great debt. Thank you. What a job.
Donald Trump: (03:36)
On this day in 1619, just a mile south of where we are gathered now, 22 newly elected members of the House of Burgesses assembled in a small wooden church. They were adventurers and explorers, farmers and planters, soldiers, scholars, and clergyman.
Donald Trump: (03:58)
All had struggled. All had suffered, and all had sacrificed in pursuit of one wild and very improbable dream. They called that dream, Virginia.
Donald Trump: (04:22)
It had been only 13 years since three small ships, the Susan Constant, the Godspeed, and the Discovery, set sail across the vast ocean. They carried 104 settlers to carve out a home on the edge of this uncharted continent.
Donald Trump: (04:43)
They came from God and country. They came in search of opportunity and fortune, and they journeyed into the unknown with only meager supplies, long odds, and the power of their Christian faith.
Donald Trump: (05:02)
Upon reaching Cape Henry at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, in 1607 a long time ago, the first men of the Virginia company erected a cross upon the shore. They gave thanks to God and asked his blessing for their great undertaking. In the months and years ahead, they would dearly need it. The dangers were unparalleled.
Donald Trump: (05:35)
The Jamestown settlers arrived in America amid one of the worst droughts in over seven centuries. Of 104 original colonists, 66 died by the year’s end. During the third winter, known as the starving time, a population of up to 500 settlers was reduced to 60.
Donald Trump: (06:02)
By spring, those who remained were in search of whatever they could get to survive, and they were in dire trouble. They left Jamestown deserted. They just sailed away, never to come back. But they had not gone far down the James River when they encountered the answer to their prayers, ships bearing a year’s worth of supplies, and more than 300 new settlers.
Donald Trump: (06:33)
As we can see today on this great anniversary, it would not be the last time that God looked out for Virginia. Together, the settlers forged what would become the timeless traits of the American character. They worked hard. They had courage and abundance, and a wealth of self-reliance. They strived mightily to turn a profit. They experimented with producing silk, corn, tobacco, and the very first Virginia wines.
Donald Trump: (07:12)
At a prior settlement at Roanoke, there had been no survivors, none at all. But where others had typically perished, the Virginians were determined to succeed. They endured by the sweat of their labor, the aid of the Powhatan Indians, and the leadership of Captain John Smith.
Donald Trump: (07:38)
As the years passed, ships bearing supplies and settlers from England also brought a culture and a way of life that would define the new world. It all began here.
Donald Trump: (07:51)
In time, dozens of brave, strong women made the journey and joined the colony. And in 1618, the Great Charter and other reforms, established a system based on English common law.
Donald Trump: (08:06)
For the first time, Virginia allowed private land ownership. It created a basic judicial system. Finally, it gave the colonists a say in their own future, the right to elect representatives by popular vote.
Donald Trump: (08:24)
With us today in tribute to that English legal inheritance is the former clerk of the British House of Commons, Sir David Natzler. Thank you, David. Thank you. Sir David, we are thrilled to have you with us. Thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much, David.
Donald Trump: (08:52)
At that first American assembly in 1619, the weather was so hot that one legislator actually died. Mercifully, the session was cut very short. But before adjourning, the assembly passed laws on taxation, agriculture, and trade with the Indians.
Donald Trump: (09:15)
With true American optimism, the assembly even endorsed a plan to build a world class university, in this still-rugged wilderness. It was a vision that would one day be fulfilled just miles from here, at one of America’s earliest educational institutions, the esteemed College of William and Mary. Great place. Great place.
Donald Trump: (09:45)
As we mark the first representative legislature at Jamestown, our nation also reflects upon an anniversary from that same summer, four centuries ago. In August, 1619, the first enslaved Africans in the English colonies arrived in Virginia. It was the beginning of a barbaric trade in human lives. Today in honor, we remember every sacred soul who suffered the horrors of slavery and the anguish of bondage.
Donald Trump: (10:26)
More than 150 years later, at America’s founding, our Declaration of Independence recognized the immortal truth that all men are created equal. Yet, it would ultimately take a civil war, 85 years after that document was signed, to abolish the evil of slavery.
Donald Trump: (11:00)
It would take more than another century for our nation, in the words of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., to live out the true meaning of its creed, and extend the blessings of freedom to all Americans.
Donald Trump: (11:24)
In the face of grave oppression and grave injustice, African Americans have built, strengthened, inspired, uplifted, protected, defended, and sustained our nation from its very earliest days.
Donald Trump: (11:40)
Last year, I was privileged to sign the law establishing a commission to commemorate the arrival of the first Africans to the English colonies, and the 400 years of African American history that have followed.
Donald Trump: (11:57)
That was an incredible day. That was an incredible event. Today, we are grateful to be joined by that commission’s chairman, Dr. Joseph Green. Thank you, Dr. Green, please. Thank you. Thank you very much. Dr. Green.
Donald Trump: (12:20)
In the decades that followed that first legislative assembly, the democratic tradition established here lay deep roots all across Virginia. It spread up and down the Atlantic coast.
Donald Trump: (12:35)
One fact was quickly established for all time. In America, we are not ruled from afar. Americans govern ourselves, and so help us, God, we always will.
Donald Trump: (12:58)
Right here in Virginia, your predecessors-
Protester: (13:40)
Mr. President, you can’t send us back. Virginia is our home. This is [inaudible 00:13:04], you can’t send us back. Virginia is our home.
Donald Trump: (13:40)
Thank you very much, thank you.
Donald Trump: (13:42)
Right here in Virginia, your predecessors came to Williamsburg from places you all know very well. They were named such as George Washington, from Fairfax County. Thomas Jefferson, from Albemarle County. James Madison, from Orange County. James Monroe, from Spotsylvania County. Patrick Henry, from Louisa County. George Mason, from Fairfax County. George With, W-I-T-H, that’s a great name, from Williamsburg. And Richard Henry Lee, from Westmoreland County. Incredible names, incredible names.
Donald Trump: (14:36)
Self government in Virginia did not just give us a state we love. In a very true sense, it gave us the country we love, the United States of America. So true. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump: (14:55)
When Madison drafted the First Amendment to our constitution, he drew inspiration from Virginia’s Statute for Religious Freedom. As John Adams wrote in Philadelphia, just before the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, we all look up to Virginia for examples. Great. It’s so great.
Donald Trump: (15:23)
And when Patrick Henry rose to speak his famous words at St. John’s Church in Richmond, “Give me liberty or give me death,” he spoke in defense of a tradition that began more than 150 years before at Jamestown. Right here.
Donald Trump: (15:48)
It was a heritage those patriots would fight a long war of independence to defend, and it is a heritage that countless Americans have fought and died for to secure in all of those centuries since. In our time, we must vigorously defend those cherished democratic traditions that have made our beloved republic the envy of the entire world. And it still is, as much as ever before, and maybe more.
Donald Trump: (16:22)
Our hard-won culture of self-government must be nourished, protected, and constantly preserved. That is why we must speak out strongly against anyone who would take power away from citizens, individuals, and state governments such as yours. In America, the people will forever rule. The people will forever reign, and the people will forever be sovereign.
Donald Trump: (17:08)
From the first legislative assembly down to today, America has been the story of citizens who take ownership of their future and their control of their destiny. That is what self-rule is all about, everyday Americans coming together to take action, to build, to create, to seize opportunities, to pursue the common good, and to never stop striving for greatness.
Donald Trump: (17:43)
Four centuries ago, one early voyager to Jamestown captured the spirit of confidence and daring that has always powered our great experiment in self-government. He wrote, “We hope to plant a nation where none before hath stood.” That was something.
Donald Trump: (18:03)
In that hope, the men and women of Jamestown achieved success beyond anything they could possibly have imagined. They started the nation that settled the wilderness, won our independence, tamed the Wild West, ended slavery, secured civil rights, invented the airplane, vanquished the Nazis, brought communism to its knees, and placed our great American flag on the face of the moon.
Donald Trump: (18:43)
And in a program that’s just started, someday very soon, American astronauts will plant our beautiful stars and stripes on the surface of Mars.
Donald Trump: (18:59)
But among all of America’s towering achievements, none exceeds the triumph that we are here to celebrate today. Our nation’s priceless culture of freedom, independence, equality, justice, and self-determination under God.
Donald Trump: (19:23)
That culture is the source of who we are. It is our prized inheritance. It is our proudest legacy. It is among the greatest human accomplishments in the history of the world. What you have done is the greatest accomplishment in the history of the world, and I congratulate you. It started right here.
Donald Trump: (19:56)
Now, we must go bravely into the future, just as those bold explorers first ventured into this majestic land. We must call upon the same scale of imagination, the same thirst for knowledge, the same love of adventure, the same unrelenting courage, and the same total determination to prevail.
Donald Trump: (20:19)
Above all, we must be proud of our heritage, united in our purpose, and filled with confidence in our shared great, great, great American destiny.
Donald Trump: (20:42)
For in America, no challenge is too great. No journey is too tough. No task is too large. No dream is beyond our reach. When we set our sight on the summit, nothing can stand in our way. America always gets the job done. America always wins.
Donald Trump: (21:12)
That is why after 400 years of glorious American democracy, we have returned here to this place to declare to all the world that the United States of America and the Great Commonwealth of Virginia are just getting started.
Donald Trump: (21:38)
Our future is bigger, bolder, better, and brighter than ever before. It’s been a great honor for me to be with you this morning. I’d like to thank you. God bless you. God bless Virginia, and God bless America. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you."
"Jun 26, 2019",2:34 P.M. CDT,"Chuck Todd:
Mr. President welcome back to Meet the Press.
Donald Trump:
Thank you.
Chuck Todd:
Let me start right in. What happened last night?
Donald Trump:
Well, you had a situation that was very bad, because the night before they shot down an unmanned drone and the unmanned is a very big factor. The fact that there was not a person on it, a US person on it or anybody. And that had an impact on me. I said, “Well, we got a little problem.” And I think they did it on purpose because they understand that they will be hit very hard if that were a plane with a person in it. And I think they knew that there was nobody there.
Donald Trump:
So, we had a very modest, but pretty heavy attack schedule.
Chuck Todd:
And this is a preplan that you had, something that if they did something you had something- these are sort of ready made plans to use if necessary.
Donald Trump:
Sure. We have many of them. Oh, I have so many targets you wouldn’t believe.
Chuck Todd:
Right.
Donald Trump:
We have targets all over.
Chuck Todd:
So did you green light something? Or had you said, “If we do it, I’ll do this?” What was the order?
Donald Trump:
Nothing is green lighted until the very end because things change, right?
Chuck Todd:
So you never gave a final order.
Donald Trump:
No, no. But we had something ready to go, subject to my approval. They came in and they came in about a half an hour before. They say, “So we’re about ready to go.” I said, “I want a better definition.”
Chuck Todd:
Like in the air? Were planes in the air?
Donald Trump:
No, no, we’re about ready to go. No, but they would’ve been pretty soon. And things would’ve happened to a point where you wouldn’t turn back or couldn’t turn back. So they came and they said, “Sir, we’re ready to go. We’d like a decision.” I said, “I want to know something before you go. How many people will be killed?” In this case, Iranians. I said, “How many people are going to be killed?”
Donald Trump:
“Sir, I’d like to get back to you on that.” Great people, these generals. They came back, said, “Sire, approximately 150.” And I thought about it for a second and I said, “You know what, they shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it, and here we are sitting with 150 dead people that would’ve taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead.” And I didn’t like it, I didn’t think it was proportionate.
Donald Trump:
Now, that doesn’t mean…
Chuck Todd:
So what should the response be right now?
Donald Trump:
I think the response should be, well first of all, as you know, we’ve done very massive sanctions. We’re increasing the sanctions now. But the response is always going to be very strong. I built up a lot of capital, I’ve had a lot of people that aren’t Trump fans saying, “I can’t believe.” You know, a lot of them said we’re going to be in World War III the first week, didn’t work out that way. We’re doing great in North Korea, we’re doing great in a lot of different places. We knocked out the caliphate in Syria, we knocked out 100%. Remember I was going to lead it-
Chuck Todd:
Not 100%. [crosstalk 00:02:44] at 100%.
Donald Trump:
No, no, no. The caliphate.
Chuck Todd:
Okay. .
Donald Trump:
No, the caliphate, which is the land, the area.
Chuck Todd:
The land, fair enough.
Donald Trump:
Is 100%. You never knock these people out. These people are stone cold crazy. And they walk into a store and they’ll be wired up for bombs and they’ll blow, it’s a horrible thing. So I never say that. I don’t want to do what other presidents have done or other people have done saying we won, because you don’t win so conclusively. I would love to have the day where we can win.
Donald Trump:
You know, I remember when I was young, I’d go on an airplane. I’d walk up, I’d buy a ticket, I’d go on a plane. Nobody thought about bombs and nobody thought about security, you’d walk in, you’d give the ticket to the person at the gate, and you’d walk into a plane. Today it’s like, a big deal.
Donald Trump:
So what happened is I said I’m not going to do it. I’ll save it. If they do something else it’ll be double.
Chuck Todd:
I think they were trying to provoke you.
Donald Trump:
No, I don’t think so. And I think it was very important that they… to them, don’t forget, their economy-
Chuck Todd:
You don’t think they intended to get you to respond militarily?
Donald Trump:
Their economy is shattered, shattered.
Chuck Todd:
So what’s the message do you think they’re sending?
Donald Trump:
Their inflation is through the roof. They’ve never had, the highest in the world right now. Worse than any place. They’re living not well.
Chuck Todd:
So put yourself in their shoes, what do you think message they’re trying to send you with this?
Donald Trump:
I think they want to negotiate and I think they want to make a deal, and my deal is nuclear. Look, they’re not going to have a nuclear weapon. This isn’t about the Straits. Do you know that China gets 91% of its oil from the Straits? We don’t even need the Straits. We are now, since I came in, we’re the number one energy producer in the world, okay? Actually by far. And if I get the pipelines approved through the environmental process, which I will in Texas, we’ll go up by another 25%. But we’re way ahead of Russia, we’re way ahead of Saudi Arabia.
Donald Trump:
I think that they want to negotiate, I don’t think they like the position they’re in. Their economy is absolutely broken.
Chuck Todd:
So you sent a letter to the Ayatollah via Prime Minister Abe. And the Ayatollah seemed to say, “I’m not talking to you.”
Donald Trump:
I didn’t send a letter, no.
Chuck Todd:
Was it a verbal message? What did Prime Minister Abe carry on your behalf?
Donald Trump:
Prime Minister Abe’s a great guy. He’s a friend of mine and he obviously is close to them. I think he was their largest buyer of oil from before.
Chuck Todd:
Did he deliver a message from you to them?
Donald Trump:
No. He wanted to do something.
Chuck Todd:
Okay.
Donald Trump:
According to Prime Minister Abe, they went to him, this is according to the Prime Minister, and they said, “What do we do with Trump? Can we make a deal? Is there something that can be done?” That’s what Prime Minister Abe told me.
Donald Trump:
I said, “Do you mind if I say that if I have to?” And he said, “Not particularly.” So they came to Prime Minister Abe. He then called me, I said, “Send the following message: you can’t have nuclear weapons and other than that we can sit down and make a deal. But you cannot have nuclear weapons.”
Chuck Todd:
No other conditions other than that?
Donald Trump:
You cannot have nuclear weapons. And they would’ve had them with President Obama. He gave them 150 billion dollars [crosstalk 00:05:33] Remember this-
Chuck Todd:
What is your deal? I understand, but what is your deal going to look like with them?
Donald Trump:
Let me explain something. Number one, you have to look at the sites. Some of the most important sites we weren’t even allowed to look at or inspect, okay? Number two, the term was not long enough. There’s like, a short number of years left. After a very small number of years, you’re talking about a country, after a very small number of years, they have a free pass to nuclear weapons. You can’t do that. So I want to be able to inspect all sites, they cannot have ballistic missiles, which under the agreement isn’t even covered. And as you know, that agreement wasn’t even approved by Congress, a lot of people don’t know that. That was an agreement that he couldn’t get through Congress. He was not authorized really to do that deal.
Chuck Todd:
Congress did give him some authorization [crosstalk 00:06:16]
Donald Trump:
It wasn’t ratified by Congress.
Chuck Todd:
It wasn’t a treaty.
Donald Trump:
It was very, very short of what it should have been. You know that.
Chuck Todd:
Don’t you think though… what does it tell you that the Iranians haven’t violated the agreement yet? That they are trying hard not to violate the agreement?
Donald Trump:
Well you see, I think they have violated the agreement, because I think in the areas that we’re not allowed to inspect they’re doing things, and I think they have been for years.
Chuck Todd:
Europeans don’t think they’re violating the agreement.
Donald Trump:
Well I don’t care about the Europeans. The Europeans are going out and making a lot of money. The Europeans are fine, but they’re going out and making a lot of money. In France they’re selling cars to Iran. They’re doing other things. And let me tell you, we’re very good to Europe. We take care of them. NATO, we spend a tremendous about of disproportionate amount. On trade, the European Union’s taken, they have really taken advantage of us for a long time.
Donald Trump:
Just to finish, we have great relationships with Europe. I don’t mind Europe getting in the middle, Europe wants to make a deal too, Europe would love to see a deal being made.
Chuck Todd:
Are these going to be separate deals? Do you want to do a separate deal with Iran or do you want to get everybody involved in the same deal? Get the Russians, get the Chinese.
Donald Trump:
I don’t care what kind of a deal, it can be separate or it can be total.
Chuck Todd:
But it’s one on one talks, you and the Ayatollah?
Donald Trump:
All it is-
Chuck Todd:
Is it one on one talks, you and the Ayatollah? Or you and the President?
Donald Trump:
It doesn’t matter to me. Here’s what I want, anything that gets you to the result they cannot have a nuclear weapon. It’s not about the Straits, you know, a lot of people covered it incorrectly. They never mention they cannot have a nuclear weapon, they’d use it, and they’re not going to have a nuclear weapon. And it’s not about the oil-
Chuck Todd:
Did you send the message last night? Reuters is reporting that you sent a message to the Iranians saying, “I don’t want war, I want to talk.”
Donald Trump:
I did not send that message. I did not send that message. I don’t know who would’ve said that.
Chuck Todd:
Okay. Send a message right now to the Ayatollah.
Donald Trump:
I mean, it’s fake news.
Chuck Todd:
Then send a message right now to the Ayatollah.
Donald Trump:
It wouldn’t be much different than that message.
Chuck Todd:
Which is?
Donald Trump:
I’m not looking for war. And if there is, it’ll be obliteration like you’ve never seen before. But I’m not looking to do that, but you can’t have a nuclear weapon. You want to talk, good. Otherwise you can have a bad economy for the next three years.
Chuck Todd:
No preconditions?
Donald Trump:
Not as far as I’m concerned, no preconditions.
Chuck Todd:
And you’ll talk anyway?
Donald Trump:
Here it is, look, you can’t have nuclear weapons. And if you want to talk about it, good. Otherwise you can live in a shattered economy for a long time to come.
Chuck Todd:
Do you feel like you were being pushed into military action against Iran by any of your advisors?
Donald Trump:
I have two groups of people, I have doves and I have hawks.
Chuck Todd:
Yeah, you have some serious hawks.
Donald Trump:
I have some hawks, yeah, John Bolton is absolutely a hawk. If it was up to him he’d take on the whole world at one time, okay? But that doesn’t matter because I want both sides. You know, some people said, “Why did you put.” You know, I was against going into Iraq, for years and years. And before it ever happened, I was against going into Iraq. And some people said, “Oh, I don’t know.” I was totally against and I was a private citizen, it never made sense to me.
Donald Trump:
I was against going into the Middle East. Chuck, we’ve spent seven trillion dollars in the Middle East right now.
Chuck Todd:
Why is this our problem? This is a proxy war. Iran and Saudi Arabia are in a fight to the death out there.
Donald Trump:
Yeah, you’re right. Your right. And that’s another thing I’ve done.
Chuck Todd:
Canada, Trump, for years would have said, “Not our fight.” Why get involved?
Donald Trump:
Because of nuclear weapons, it has nothing to do with oil.
Chuck Todd:
So the minute you get them to do nuclear weapons you want out of the Middle East?
Donald Trump:
That’s all I care about… well, we’re going to protect Israel, but I have nothing to do, absolutely nothing- and we’re going to protect Saudi Arabia, look, Saudi Arabia’s buying 400 billion dollars worth of things for us, that’s a very good thing.
Chuck Todd:
You used to say we don’t get anything in return for protecting Saudi Arabia.
Donald Trump:
We are now.
Chuck Todd:
Do you feel like they’re now paying for the American protection?
Donald Trump:
I spoke to the Crown Prince this morning. We had a great conversation. I said, “This is a very expensive operation, you and the other nations that we’re protecting have to pay.” And he said, “Yes.”
Chuck Todd:
Did you talk to him about the UN report about Jamal Khashoggi?
Donald Trump:
I did not because it really didn’t come up in that discussion. I called about one reason.
Chuck Todd:
I understand.
Donald Trump:
I didn’t call about that. I called about one reason. There’s a very expensive operation. Unlike President Obama, and unlike everybody else, I’ll say others too, not just President Obama. You’ve got to pay for it. We just don’t want to go and protect the Middle East and protect Saudi Arabia and everyone else and not get reimbursed.
Chuck Todd:
So this is why you’re overruling Congress and letting all these weapon sales happen in Saudi Arabia.
Donald Trump:
Economic development. And that, but economic development.
Chuck Todd:
Nevermind the humanitarian disaster that’s taken place in Yemen?
Donald Trump:
A million jobs. No, it’s going to end, it’s going to end. By the way, who’s causing it though? If you look at it, Iran goes into Yemen, they start firing rockets at Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia has to protect themselves, Chuck. But it’s a million jobs and probable more. They buy massive amounts, 150 billion dollars worth of military equipment, that by the way, we use. We use their military equipment. Unlike other countries that don’t have money, and we have to subsidize everything, so Saudi Arabia’s a big buyer of American product. That means something to me. It’s a big producer of jobs.
Chuck Todd:
It makes you overlook some of their bad behavior?
Donald Trump:
No. I don’t like anybody’s bad behavior.
Chuck Todd:
The United Nations said they’d like the United States to order the FBI to investigate Jamal Khashoggi’s death. And possibly MBS’s involvement in it. Will you allow the FBI to do that?
Donald Trump:
I think it’s been heavily investigated.
Chuck Todd:
By who?
Donald Trump:
By everybody.
Chuck Todd:
By the FBI?
Donald Trump:
I’ve seen so many different reports.
Chuck Todd:
What about the FBI?
Donald Trump:
Here’s where I am. You ready?
Chuck Todd:
Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Donald Trump:
Iran’s killed many, many people a day. Other countries in the Middle East, this is a hostile place. This is a vicious, hostile place. If you’re going to look at Saudi Arabia, look at Iran, look at other countries, I won’t mention names, and take a look at what’s happening. Then you go outside of the Middle East and you take a look at what’s happening with countries, okay? I only say they spend 400 to 450 billion over a period of time. All money, all jobs, buying equipment.
Chuck Todd:
So that’s the price, as long as they keep buying you’ll overlook some of this behavior.
Donald Trump:
No. But I’m not like, a fool that says we don’t want to do business with them. By the way, if they don’t do business with us, you know what they do? They’ll do business with the Russians and with the Chinese. We make the best equipment in the world, but they will buy great equipment from Russia and from China. Chuck, take their money. Take their money, Chuck.
Chuck Todd:
What would candidate Trump have said about a president who on his watch had Iran shooting down a drone, a Venezuelan dictator thumbing his nose at you, Obamacare’s still on the books, and no results yet on the border. The border getting tough.
Donald Trump:
Well let’s take a look.
Chuck Todd:
What would candidate Trump have said about that?
Donald Trump:
Let’s take a look. The border’s doing great, Mexico’s been fantastic. They’ve been trying to get a deal with Mexico for 45 years, right? So for 45 years they couldn’t get a deal, I got one in one day. I said, “We’re going to put tariffs on and you can have a deal or not.” We agreed in one day, Mexico just moved 6000 people to their southern border, 6000 troops to their southern border. The border’s working out well and the wall is being built. I mean, a lot of people don’t like to talk about it, we’re building the wall. We will have 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. And that’s hard because the Democrats don’t want to approve it, we just beat them in a big lawsuit as you know, in Washington, in DC, we just beat them at a very big lawsuit where they tried to-
Chuck Todd:
But doesn’t it frustrate you that your border numbers are worse than Obama’s?
Donald Trump:
No, because the people are coming up because our economy is so good. They’re pouring up because the economy is so good. Obama had a lousy economy, it was a dead economy.
Chuck Todd:
Can I ask you about that? Let me show you this chart. Do you see that chart?
Donald Trump:
No.
Chuck Todd:
It’s the unemployment rate from the peak of the Recession.
Donald Trump:
Right.
Chuck Todd:
Your economy’s great, I’m not saying it’s not great. But this recovery started, and in the 28 months that you’ve been president, and the last 28 months of Obama’s presidency, he averaged more new jobs than your first 28 months.
Donald Trump:
That’s because he started off with such a bad base.
Chuck Todd:
Okay. But is it not a continuous-
Donald Trump:
Chuck, you have to understand, nobody was working. The whole place was a disaster, and I’d never take that away. But it’s very easy, because when that turned around, they pumped a tremendous amount of money into the economy. He also had a Federal Reserve person who kept the interest rates low, I don’t. I don’t have that privilege.
Chuck Todd:
Sounds like you do now.
Donald Trump:
Oh, no, no. You raised him far too fast. You raised him far too fast.
Chuck Todd:
Your threat to demote him, do you think that’s had an impact?
Donald Trump:
I didn’t ever threaten to demote him.
Chuck Todd:
There’s been some talk that you might demote him to the number two slot.
Donald Trump:
I’d be able to do that if I wanted, but I haven’t suggested that.
Chuck Todd:
That’s not a threat, that’s just a reminder that you can?
Donald Trump:
No, no. I have the right to do that, but I haven’t said that. What he’s done is 50 billion a month in quantitative tightening, that’s ridiculous. What he’s done is he raised interest rates too fast, I can prove it all.
Chuck Todd:
Do you worry he’s going to hurt your reelection?
Donald Trump:
I think the economy’s so strong we’re going to bull through it. But I’m not happy with his actions, no. I don’t think he’s done a good job. I think this, if he didn’t raise rates… Obama had very low rates, so Obama was playing with funny money, I wasn’t. I’m playing with the real stuff.
Chuck Todd:
Let me ask you this.
Donald Trump:
Wait, wait. Obama had somebody that kept the rates very low, I had somebody that raised the rates very rapidly, too much. He made a mistake, that’s been proven. And yet, my economy is phenomenal. We have now the best economy maybe in the history of our country. Just to finish off, when I took over, this country, the economy was ready to collapse. You take a look at the numbers, it was ready to collapse. And if I didn’t win-
Chuck Todd:
I just showed you the numbers. It was not ready to collapse.
Donald Trump:
You showed me unemployment numbers.
Chuck Todd:
Yeah, but unemployment, it was not ready to collapse.
Donald Trump:
Excuse me, excuse me. Take a look at your GDP, take a look at your jobs, take a look at your optimism, take a look at all of the charts. When I took over, from election day on, I mean you show me one chart.
Chuck Todd:
Let’s see your unemployment rate.
Donald Trump:
I did well in that too, but I’m not talking about that. Take a look at some of the optimism charts and everything else. It went from 57 to 92? Nobody’s ever seen anything that-
Chuck Todd:
Your right. The optimism, you’re right.
Donald Trump:
Right after I won. Well optimism is a big part of success in business, okay.
Chuck Todd:
You were always hard on Obama, you thought he wasn’t enough of a cheerleader.
Donald Trump:
He was not a cheerleader.
Chuck Todd:
If you could have one do over as president, what would it be?
Donald Trump:
Well it would be personnel. I would say if I had one do over, it would be I would not have appointed Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General, that would be my one.
Chuck Todd:
In your mind that [crosstalk 00:16:16]
Donald Trump:
Yeah. That was the biggest.
Chuck Todd:
Is Bill Barr your Roy Cohn?
Donald Trump:
He should’ve never… I think he’s a very talented, very-
Chuck Todd:
You know what I mean by that, you’ve always said, “Where’s my Roy Cohn?” Is he your Roy Cohn?
Donald Trump:
No, no, no. Look, you have to see him, Roy Cohn, but I had many, many lawyers, a lot of lawyers. Roy was one of them, he was a tough guy. Bill Barr is a… First of all, Bill Barr-
Chuck Todd:
Is he cut from the same cloth you think?
Donald Trump:
Bill Barr is equally tough. He’s a fine man. He’s a fine man. The job he’s done is incredible. He’s brought sanity back. I think he’s real, I don’t think, I know, he’s respected. You know, he loves the Department of Justice. He saw what was happening. He has done a spectacular job. Now he’s in the process of doing something and I stay away from it, I stay away from it. But I think he feels that what’s happened in this country was a very bad thing and very bad for our country.
Chuck Todd:
I want to ask what’s going down with the children in these migrant camps. The stories are horrible, Mr. President. You have children without their parents, you have kids taking care of kids.
Donald Trump:
Yeah.
Chuck Todd:
You’ve read these reports, I know people are coming to you. I know you think this is the Democrats problem. Forget it, why aren’t you doing something about it?
Donald Trump:
Are you ready?
Chuck Todd:
They are in terrible shape down there, Mr. President. Down in Homestead, Florida, that’s where I grew up.
Donald Trump:
Okay.
Chuck Todd:
The conditions are terrible.
Donald Trump:
I agree. And it’s been that way for a long time.
Chuck Todd:
Do something.
Donald Trump:
President Obama built the cages. Remember when they said that I built them? And then it was 1914.
Chuck Todd:
Do two wrongs make a right?
Donald Trump:
It was 2014. Chuck, just listen for one second, separation. President Obama, I took over separation. I’m the one that put it together. What’s happened though, are the cartels and all of these bad people, they’re using the kids. It’s almost like slavery.
Chuck Todd:
Well let’s not punish the kids more.
Donald Trump:
This has been happening-
Chuck Todd:
The kids are getting punished more.
Donald Trump:
You’re right, and this has been happening long before I got there. What we’ve done is we’ve created- we’ve ended separation. You know, under President Obama you had separation. I was the one that ended it. Now I said one thing. When I ended it, I said, “Here’s what’s going to happen, more families are going to come up.” And that’s what’s happened. But they’re really coming up for the economics, but once you ended the separation. But I ended separation. I inherited separation from President Obama.
Donald Trump:
President Obama built, they call them jail cells. They were built by the Obama-
Chuck Todd:
Let’s talk about what’s happening now.
Donald Trump:
I’m just telling you.
Chuck Todd:
Your administration, you’re not doing the recreation, you’re not even schooling these kids anymore, you’ve gotten rid of all that stuff.
Donald Trump:
We’re doing a fantastic job under the circumstances. The Democrats aren’t even approving giving us money. Where is the money? You know what? The Democrats are holding up the humanitarian aide.
Chuck Todd:
It looks like these kids are being used as some sort of… is it hostage? They’re being held hostage.
Donald Trump:
Well they are being used. They are being used by very bad people on the other side, where they actually get paid. Money is being made using them because our laws are so bad. Because if you have a child, you have an advantage, you know that better than anybody. And what should happen, Chuck?
Chuck Todd:
But why let the political debate hurt these children? They could be impacted for years.
Donald Trump:
If the Democrats would change the asylum laws and the loopholes, which they refuse to do because they think it’s good politics, everything would be solved immediately. But they refuse to do it. They refuse to do it. Do you know what? If they change those, I say, I used to say 45 minutes, it’s 15 minutes. If they changed asylum and if they changed loopholes, everything on the border would be perfect.
Chuck Todd:
Let me ask you this, why do you think Nancy Pelosi has held off her impeachment caucus?
Donald Trump:
Because I think she feels that I will win much easier. I mean, I’ve been told that by many people.
Chuck Todd:
Do you think impeachment’s good politics for you?
Donald Trump:
I think I win the election easier, but you know, I’m not sure that I like having it. Look, I did nothing wrong, I was spied on. What they did to me was illegal. It was illegal on the other side, I did nothing wrong. So impeachment’s a very unfair thing, because nothing that I did was wrong. And if you look at the Mueller Report, there was no collusion. This was all about collusion.
Chuck Todd:
Nowhere in the Mueller Report, by the way, Mr. President, you say no collusion, I’ve read this Mueller Report, both parts of it-
Donald Trump:
Use the word collusion, or use-
Chuck Todd:
There’s not one place that says nothing happened.
Donald Trump:
Use the word collusion, use the word conspiracy.
Chuck Todd:
It never says no collusion.
Donald Trump:
I’ll be honest with you, nobody even mentions Russia anymore. Since the Mueller Report, they don’t mention it, in all fairness. Nobody mentions Russia anymore, and it was about Russia. It was a hoax.
Chuck Todd:
Let me ask you this, during the campaign-
Donald Trump:
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, we’ll give you the time that you need.
Chuck Todd:
What hoax it was?
Donald Trump:
It was a hoax, the Russian hoax, with me.
Chuck Todd:
You don’t believe it happened?
Donald Trump:
I had nothing to do-
Chuck Todd:
You don’t believe the Russians interfered in our election?
Donald Trump:
What they did with respect to the election is different, we’re not talking about that. We’re talking about my campaign working is a hoax.
Chuck Todd:
The idea that you were conspiring. Fair enough.
Donald Trump:
Okay, good.
Chuck Todd:
But going back, on Wikileaks, knowing now that that was stolen foreign material, do you regret using it?
Donald Trump:
Well I wouldn’t have, but this was well known. I think it was in papers, and again now, I’m going back a long ways, but [crosstalk 00:21:00]
Chuck Todd:
It was all rumored to be Russian stolen property so why’d you use it?
Donald Trump:
How would I even know that? I made a speech. It was in there about Wikileaks, I’m not a Wikileaks person.
Chuck Todd:
Knowing now, knowing that they’re a Russian Intelligence asset, do you regret it?
Donald Trump:
Let me tell you, Wikileaks, et cetera, that’s not my deal in life. In other words, I don’t know about Wikileaks, it was a strange name. But there were stories about, something Wikileaks, that they had information. And I say it in a joking manner at a speech. Joking, everybody laughing, everybody having a good… and they made it like it was serious. No, I don’t want anything bad to happen to our country. Anything bad happens to this country, I will end it and I’ll end it fast, I don’t want any of that to happen.
Chuck Todd:
There’s one part in the Mueller Report, your son, Donald Trump Junior did cooperate and appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee. In the Mueller Report it says that he did not voluntarily sit for an interview with Mueller’s team, and then there’s a redaction, a Grand Jury redaction. Did he involuntarily sit?
Donald Trump:
I don’t know. I can only tell you this. My son-
Chuck Todd:
Is it possible he was subpoenaed?
Donald Trump:
I really don’t know.
Chuck Todd:
You don’t know if he was subpoenaed?
Donald Trump:
But let me tell you what I do know.
Chuck Todd:
So did you not read the Mueller Report?
Donald Trump:
Let me tell you, I read much of it.
Chuck Todd:
The unredacted version? Or no.
Donald Trump:
No I didn’t, I didn’t. But let me just tell you-
Chuck Todd:
So if he was subpoenaed you wouldn’t know?
Donald Trump:
I read the conclusion. Well he was subpoenaed, ultimately he was subpoenaed to sit before the Senate intel. And he did that.
Chuck Todd:
But was he subpoenaed by Mr. Mueller?
Donald Trump:
I don’t know, but I don’t think so.
Chuck Todd:
If he was subpoenaed, was he going to appear before the Grand Jury or was he just going to plead the fifth?
Donald Trump:
I don’t know, I really don’t know, but you can certainly ask him. I just don’t know.
Chuck Todd:
But you don’t know.
Donald Trump:
My son, he has been treated so unfairly. He sat for many, many hours before these committees. I think, my impression is that Mueller took all of the information from the committees, and he used that information. How much can you talk about something? Remember the phone calls? The three phone calls?
Donald Trump:
It was such a big deal. Three phone calls that were made to a special type number. Okay? And everybody said, “Oh, he called his father.” That went on for a year. In other words, before this so called meeting, and after the meeting, “He called his father!” The biggest story, headlines all over the place. And then it turned out… and I give Mueller credit because Mueller was the one that found out, through I guess the phone companies or whatever, somebody found out, maybe through the FBI… Big investigation on who the calls were made, if they were made to me it would have sounded like you.
Donald Trump:
Wait a minute, they turned out that it wasn’t to me. It was to a real estate person and a NASCAR person. Two great people. Have nothing to do with Russia, have nothing to do. And you know what? People hardly even put the story in. My son was treated unfairly. My son, he spent 20 some odd hours, and then he went back again. He is a very innocent young man, and he was treated very badly.
Chuck Todd:
You’re going to see Vladimir Putin in a week.
Donald Trump:
Yes. I’m going to see him [crosstalk 00:23:57]
Chuck Todd:
Are you going to address him directly about interference in 2020?
Donald Trump:
I may. I may.
Chuck Todd:
Are you going to tell him not to do it?
Donald Trump:
I may, if you’d like me to do it, I’ll do that. You know what? Here’s what you do.
Chuck Todd:
Well some people think that your answer last week invited him to do it again.
Donald Trump:
Oh, that’s not true. That’s not true.
Chuck Todd:
Are you going to tell him not to, and what are the consequences?
Donald Trump:
My answer last week was both. I said both, I’d do both. Except they didn’t put it on, and when they did put it on, people understood. But they didn’t put it on because they put a different segment on. So they asked me a question, but when I said, “Yeah, I’d do both.” People saw that in the last version of it, because the thing played like all weekend and on Friday. So it’s just more fake news.
Donald Trump:
Chuck, there’s so much fake news. It would be so good if-
Chuck Todd:
That’s why I’m interviewing you one on one.
Donald Trump:
That’s fine, that’s what I like doing.
Chuck Todd:
Let me ask you this.
Donald Trump:
But I like live interviews better, you know why? Because you can’t cut the answers.
Chuck Todd:
Guess what, you’re going to enjoy the fact that I’m not going to over edit this interview, that I promise you.
Chuck Todd:
Do you think you’ve been more successful in business or the presidency?
Donald Trump:
Well, I can’t be more successful in politics. I mean, I ran once and I’m President, right? So you have to say that’s about… it’s never happened before, right? So I’m one for one and I hope to be two for two. But my business has been a tremendous success. I actually said to the lawyers, I’d like to show my financial statement. My financial statement is great. I built a [crosstalk 00:25:15]
Chuck Todd:
You could release your tax returns any day if you want.
Donald Trump:
You don’t learn from tax returns, and I’m under audit, Chuck. I’ve been saying I, I’m under audit. But you don’t learn from tax returns.
Chuck Todd:
I was under audit, I had my tax returns.
Donald Trump:
But you would learn from a financial statement. I would like to release it. I’ve built a great company. They like to… for instance, banks. I could’ve borrowed from banks but I didn’t need to, because I had money. I did things.. in fact a lot of people over the last couple of years were really surprised. “He paid all cash, he didn’t use banks.”
Donald Trump:
I think I’ve been tremendously successful in business. I think I’ve been tremendously successful in show business, with The Apprentice. I mean, I did one show and it was a great hit, as you know from NBC. And I guess you’d have to say I’ve been really successful in politics.
Chuck Todd:
The Republican Party has changed in your image. Do you think you caused that change? Or do you think the party was changing and you were the leader they selected?
Donald Trump:
I think common sense caused it. You know, I’m about common sense. People say, “Are you conservative?” I guess I’m conservative, but I’m about common sense. I’m about we need borders, we’re going to have borders and we have strong borders. By the way, Mexico has done a great job, it’s slowed down so much. But we have an amazing economy and people want to come up, but it’s slowed down so much.
Donald Trump:
But I’m about borders. I’m about great healthcare. Obamacare is a disaster. I got rid of the individual mandate.
Chuck Todd:
By the way, why is the economy doing so well if Obamacare is still law of the land? You had said in 2011-
Donald Trump:
We are managing.
Chuck Todd:
“Obamacare is going to destroy the economy.” Obamacare is still here, and the economy’s great.
Donald Trump:
Because I’ve managed it great. I had a choice. I could’ve let it implode and killed it, or I could’ve managed it.
Chuck Todd:
You’re still trying to kill it.
Donald Trump:
No, no.
Chuck Todd:
Why are you still trying to kill it… This lawsuit that the Department of Justice joined, it could get rid of coverage in preexisting conditions.
Donald Trump:
I am in favor of preexisting conditions, I am fighting.
Chuck Todd:
So get rid of… so drop the lawsuit. Drop your aspect of the lawsuit.
Donald Trump:
It has nothing to do with it. The lawsuit is one thing. We are going to put it in a bill, total preexisting conditions. And the Republicans are in favor of preexisting conditions.
Chuck Todd:
Sir, you have full Republican control and they couldn’t pass anything.
Donald Trump:
Chuck-
Chuck Todd:
What makes you think you’re going to get it done this time?
Donald Trump:
Are you ready? We had a negative vote from John McCain, it was a surprising vote, but I got rid of the worst part of Obamacare which was the individual mandate. We will always protect preexisting conditions, and the reason Obamacare continues is my decision.
Chuck Todd:
And maybe- right.
Donald Trump:
Wait. I made a big decision.
Chuck Todd:
Okay.
Donald Trump:
We have a man named Azar, our Secretary. He’s a fantastic man. Alex. A total pro. I could’ve managed Obamacare so it would’ve failed, or I could’ve managed it the way we did so it’s as good as it can be. Not great, but it’s as good… it’s too expensive, the premiums are too high. I had a decision to make. I could’ve politically killed Obamacare. I decided not to do it. But still, it’s not good. We’re going to come up with great healthcare if we win the House, the Senate and the Presidency.
Chuck Todd:
Are you prepared to lose?
Donald Trump:
No. Probably not.
Chuck Todd:
Fair enough.
Donald Trump:
Probably not. I mean, it would be much better if I said, “Yeah.” It would be much easier for me to say, “Well yes.” No, I’m probably not too prepared to lose. I don’t like to lose and I haven’t lost very much in my life.
Chuck Todd:
You didn’t like the fact that you lost the popular vote. That bothered you didn’t it.
Donald Trump:
Well I think it was a… I mean I’ll say something that again, is controversial. There were a lot of votes cast that I don’t believe. I look at California.
Chuck Todd:
Mr. President.
Donald Trump:
Excuse me. Take a look at Judicial Watch, take a look at their settlement. California admitted to a million votes, they admitted to a million votes.
Chuck Todd:
A million votes of what?
Donald Trump:
Take a look at Judicial-
Chuck Todd:
What are you talking about?
Donald Trump:
Judicial Watch made a settlement. There was much-
Chuck Todd:
About what?
Donald Trump:
There was much illegal voting. But let me tell you about popular vote, do you have a second?
Chuck Todd:
Yes, because you were a big fan of it. Until you weren’t.
Donald Trump:
There are two… well I like popular vote.
Chuck Todd:
Yeah.
Donald Trump:
I think I’d do better with a popular vote. But I didn’t campaign for the popular vote.
Chuck Todd:
You’re right.
Donald Trump:
You didn’t see me campaigning in California or New York. If it was up to the popular vote, I would’ve done I think even better. I won 306 to 223, which was a lot in the Electoral College. But it’s like, you’re training for the 100 yard dash versus the mile.
Chuck Todd:
You’re totally right. If it’s a popular vote, you campaign differently.
Donald Trump:
I went to Wisconsin.
Chuck Todd:
I don’t disagree.
Donald Trump:
She forgot. I went to Michigan, she didn’t go to Michigan enough. I won Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. I won places that she didn’t do a good job, what can I tell you.
Donald Trump:
No, maybe I did a great job. You know, I never get credit for that. They always say she was a lousy candidate. I actually think that Hillary Clinton was a great candidate. She was very smart, she was very tough. She was ruthless and vicious.
Chuck Todd:
You’d rather run against her again, wouldn’t you? You only talked about her in your announcement speech.
Donald Trump:
No, no.
Chuck Todd:
You spent a lot of time talking about her.
Donald Trump:
No, I would actually rather run against Biden. I think that would be my preference.
Chuck Todd:
Why?
Donald Trump:
Sleepy Joe. He’s sleepy. She was not sleepy. Let me just tell you something, the Electoral College is tougher for a Republican to win than the popular vote in my… at least me. I feel I’d go to three places. I went to 19 or 21 states. I went to Maine four times because I wanted to get one, and I did get it. And that’s the beauty of the Electoral College. You know, I’d been a proponent of the other sometimes, and I change. But I will tell you, the Electoral College brings you to many of the states in this country.
Chuck Todd:
You have joked about a third term, you’ve joked about these things.
Donald Trump:
I only joke. I joke and I say, “Watch, I will Chuck Todd crazy.”
Chuck Todd:
Okay.
Donald Trump:
Yes, [crosstalk 00:30:32]
Chuck Todd:
You will accept the result.
Donald Trump:
Sure.
Chuck Todd:
Whatever happens in 2020.
Donald Trump:
Sure.
Chuck Todd:
You’ll be like, you’re not going to like it, but you walk out.
Donald Trump:
In fact I said at a speech recently, I said, “Watch. We’ll drive the media crazy. Let’s go for a third term and then a fourth.” And some of the media said, “He is going to do it.”
Chuck Todd:
Speaking of driving people crazy, when you were asked about Mike Pence and 2024, and you paused a minute about endorsing him as your successor, that got a lot of people going. Is Mike Pence 100% on your ticket in 2020?
Donald Trump:
Well look, 100%, yes.
Chuck Todd:
100%. There is no wiggle room?
Donald Trump:
Yes, he’s been a terrific Vice President. He’s my friend and a lot of things. No. Zero, zero.
Chuck Todd:
So why’d you hesitate in endorsing him in being-
Donald Trump:
Because it was a surprise question. I mean, I’m not even thinking of it, it’s so far out.
Chuck Todd:
Okay.
Donald Trump:
I mean, it’s so far out. That would be the only reason. Now what happens in 2024, I don’t know that Mike is going to run. I don’t know who’s running or anything else. I will say this, I think it’s a tremendous embarrassment to Joe Biden that Obama has not… the President Obama, I like to say that because it’s respect for the office. And respect for him.
Chuck Todd:
Do you speak to any of the former presidents?
Donald Trump:
Yes.
Chuck Todd:
Who’s the last one you did?
Donald Trump:
Well I speak to Bush. I speak to Jimmy Carter.
Chuck Todd:
You do? What about President Obama?
Donald Trump:
I have not spoken to him pretty much from the beginning.
Chuck Todd:
But George W. Bush you do? And Jimmy Carter?
Donald Trump:
I have spoken to Bush, I have spoken to Jimmy Carter, yes.
Chuck Todd:
Yeah? Do you get… why?
Donald Trump:
I like Jimmy Carter. You know, Jimmy Carter has oftentimes come to my defense. I don’t necessarily agree with the way he ran things and that’s okay, and he understands that and so do I. But he came to my defense on numerous occasions, and he thinks that I was treated the worst of anybody he’s ever seen by the press.
Chuck Todd:
During every new season-
Donald Trump:
I don’t think he’s including you.
Chuck Todd:
Every new season of The Apprentice, you had something new to roll out. What’s your big new idea for your reelection?
Donald Trump:
I think that the economy has tremendous upward potential despite the fact that we’re doing really well. I think when we really unleash some of the things that we’re going to do-
Chuck Todd:
Well what’s your new idea? What is the new big idea?
Donald Trump:
I also think that healthcare is going to be very important for me. I will tell you, if we win the House, the Senate and the Presidency, I will get tremendous healthcare, because Obamacare is a disaster.
Chuck Todd:
You think Democrats won the house because of healthcare?
Donald Trump:
I think they won because of preexisting condition, nothing to do with me. Because if you know, almost every race that I campaigned for somebody, they won. But I couldn’t devote too much time to the House, there’s too many people. But if you look at some of the congressmen that I did go for and went for, they won. Like in Kentucky, et cetera, et cetera.
Chuck Todd:
So you’re one new idea is going to be healthcare?
Donald Trump:
Ohio governor, he was behind, great guy.
Chuck Todd:
He was?
Donald Trump:
Mike won. Georgia, President Obama was there, Oprah was there, Michelle Obama was there it was going to be a big celebration, she was the star of the party. I went there for Brian. Brian Kemp. Brian Kemp won. Florida, Ron DeSantis. He was going to lose, he was low in the polls. I endorsed him, he went up 60 points after I endorsed him. Ron won, and he’s been a great Governor of Florida.
Donald Trump:
You know, I’ve always heard that an endorsement is nice to have but it doesn’t mean anything. I’m driving people up 30, 40, 50, 60 percent.
Chuck Todd:
Well when you show up, you bring a lot of people.
Donald Trump:
We bring something very good.
Chuck Todd:
I am curious, did you see Jon Stewart’s pretty passionate plea on behalf of 9/11 responders?
Donald Trump:
I was very impressed, yes.
Chuck Todd:
He’s frustrated with Mitch McConnell, he feels like Mitch McConnell’s the guy standing in the way of this bill. You’re a New Yorker first, I know that in you. I’ve got to think Jon Stewart got to you.
Donald Trump:
Yeah, well-
Chuck Todd:
Are you going to tell Mitch McConnell to-
Donald Trump:
I liked what Jon Stewart did, I actually did. And I actually have a meeting on that subject next week. So we’ll see what happens. You know it’s a very complicated subject for a lot of reasons, okay?
Chuck Todd:
I understand that it is. But do you think that Jon Stewart had a point that Congress hadn’t done enough?
Donald Trump:
I have a meeting on that subject with… Well when you say Congress, billions of dollars has been paid.
Chuck Todd:
I understand that.
Donald Trump:
Okay, billions.
Chuck Todd:
Right. But the fund was about to run out.
Donald Trump:
Memorials have been built. Tremendous amounts of money. But there are still people that are sick. I have a meeting on it next week.
Chuck Todd:
All right, Mr. President.
Donald Trump:
Thank you.
Chuck Todd:
I appreciate the time.
Donald Trump:
Thank you very much.
Chuck Todd:
Thank you sir.
